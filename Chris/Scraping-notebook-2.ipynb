This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multilabel learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2510.15871v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2510.15871v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         △ Less\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Submitted\n","       </span>\n","       6 May, 2025;\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        originally announced\n","       </span>\n","       October 2025.\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Comments:\n","       </span>\n","       <span class=\"has-text-grey-dark mathjax\">\n","        45 pages, 18 Figures, a review paper\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        MSC Class:\n","       </span>\n","       94A17; 94A15; 68T05; 62F15; 68P30; 68T27; 68T50; 30B42\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        ACM Class:\n","       </span>\n","       H.1.1; I.1.2; I.2.6; I.2.8; I.2.4; E.4; G.1.6\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Journal ref:\n","       </span>\n","       published on Entropy, April, 2025;\n","      </p>\n","     </li>\n","     <li class=\"arxiv-result\">\n","      <div class=\"is-marginless\">\n","       <p class=\"list-title is-inline-block\">\n","        <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14235\">\n","         arXiv:2509.14235\n","        </a>\n","        <span>\n","         [\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14235\">\n","          pdf\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ps/2509.14235\">\n","          ps\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/format/2509.14235\">\n","          other\n","         </a>\n","         ]\n","        </span>\n","       </p>\n","       <div class=\"tags is-inline-block\">\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Quantum Algebra\">\n","         math.QA\n","        </span>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p class=\"title is-5 mathjax\">\n","       Deformation Quantization on $\\mathbb{R}^d$\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"authors\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Authors:\n","       </span>\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wu%2C+H\">\n","        Haiqi Wu\n","       </a>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"abstract mathjax\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Abstract\n","       </span>\n","       :\n","       <span class=\"abstract-short has-text-grey-dark mathjax\" id=\"2509.14235v1-abstract-short\" style=\"display: inline;\">\n","        The primary aim of this essay, drawn from the author's MMath dissertation at Oxford, is to present and explain Kontsevich's formality theorem.

To address this, an energy-based loss function, customized integration schemes, and domain decomposition procedures are proposed. Inspired by the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM), the neural network solution space is enriched with specialized functions that allow crack body discontinuities and singularities at crack tips to be explicitly captured. Furthermore, a structured framework is introduced in which standard and enriched solution components are modeled using distinct neural networks, enabling flexible and effective simulations of complex multiple-crack problems in 1D and 2D domains, with convenient extensibility to 3D problems. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2509.13952v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2509.13952v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         △ Less\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Submitted\n","       </span>\n","       7 June, 2025;\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        originally announced\n","       </span>\n","       September 2025.\n","      </p>\n","     </li>\n","     <li class=\"arxiv-result\">\n","      <div class=\"is-marginless\">\n","       <p class=\"list-title is-inline-block\">\n","        <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11633\">\n","         arXiv:2508.11633\n","        </a>\n","        <span>\n","         [\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11633\">\n","          pdf\n","         </a>\n","         ]\n","        </span>\n","       </p>\n","       <div class=\"tags is-inline-block\">\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Computational Geometry\">\n","         cs.CG\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Algebraic Geometry\">\n","         math.AG\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Metric Geometry\">\n","         math.MG\n","        </span>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p class=\"title is-5 mathjax\">\n","       Complementary bodies in sphere packing\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"authors\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Authors:\n","       </span>\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kuchel%2C+P+W\">\n","        Philip W.

These structures are relevant in geometric studies and applications such as modelling diffusion in porous media and biological tissues. This work examines the properties of these complementary bodies, deriving their surface area-to-volume ratios, which are significant in physical contexts; and we establish a result concerning the packing density of truncated tetrahedra and octahedra, demonstrating how they tile the interstitial space surrounding packed spheres. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of classical packing problems and their geometrical complements.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2508.11633v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2508.11633v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         △ Less\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Submitted\n","       </span>\n","       18 June, 2025;\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        originally announced\n","       </span>\n","       August 2025.\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Comments:\n","       </span>\n","       <span class=\"has-text-grey-dark mathjax\">\n","        18 pages, 10 figures\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","     </li>\n","     <li class=\"arxiv-result\">\n","      <div class=\"is-marginless\">\n","       <p class=\"list-title is-inline-block\">\n","        <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02674\">\n","         arXiv:2508.02674\n","        </a>\n","        <span>\n","         [\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02674\">\n","          pdf\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ps/2508.02674\">\n","          ps\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/format/2508.02674\">\n","          other\n","         </a>\n","         ]\n","        </span>\n","       </p>\n","       <div class=\"tags is-inline-block\">\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Numerical Analysis\">\n","         math.NA\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Information Theory\">\n","         cs.IT\n","        </span>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p class=\"title is-5 mathjax\">\n","       Orbit recovery for spherical functions\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"authors\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Authors:\n","       </span>\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Bendory%2C+T\">\n","        Tamir Bendory\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Edidin%2C+D\">\n","        Dan Edidin\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Katz%2C+J\">\n","        Josh Katz\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kreymer%2C+S\">\n","        Shay Kreymer\n","       </a>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"abstract mathjax\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Abstract\n","       </span>\n","       :\n","       <span class=\"abstract-short has-text-grey-dark mathjax\" id=\"2508.02674v1-abstract-short\" style=\"display: inline;\">\n","        Orbit recovery is a central problem in both mathematics and applied sciences, with important applications to structural biology.

This paper focuses on recovering generic orbits of functions on ${\\mathbb R}^{n}$ and the sphere $S^{n-1}$ under the rotation action of $SO(n)$. Specifically, we demonstrate that invariants of degree three (called the bispectrum) suffice to recover generic orbits of functions in finite-dimensional approximations of $L^2({\\mathbb R}^n)$ obtained by band-limiting the spherical component and discretizing the radial direction. In particular, our main result explicitly bounds the number of samples in the radial direction required for recovery from the degree three invariants. From an application perspective, the most important case is $SO(3)$, which arises in many scientific fields, and in particular, plays a central role in leading structural biology applications such as cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. Our result for $SO(3)$ states that considering three spherical shells (i.e., samples in the radial direction) is sufficient to recover generic orbits, which verifies an implicit conjecture made in a paper of Bandeira et al. Our proof technique provides an explicit, computationally efficient algorithm to recover the signal by successively solving systems of linear equations. We implemented this algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness on two protein structures.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2508.02674v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2508.02674v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         △ Less\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Submitted\n","       </span>\n","       30 June, 2025;\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        originally announced\n","       </span>\n","       August 2025.\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Comments:\n","       </span>\n","       <span class=\"has-text-grey-dark mathjax\">\n","        15 pages\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        MSC Class:\n","       </span>\n","       94A12; 22D10\n","      </p>\n","     </li>\n","     <li class=\"arxiv-result\">\n","      <div class=\"is-marginless\">\n","       <p class=\"list-title is-inline-block\">\n","        <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02673\">\n","         arXiv:2508.02673\n","        </a>\n","        <span>\n","         [\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02673\">\n","          pdf\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ps/2508.02673\">\n","          ps\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/format/2508.02673\">\n","          other\n","         </a>\n","         ]\n","        </span>\n","       </p>\n","       <div class=\"tags is-inline-block\">\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science\">\n","         cs.CE\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Numerical Analysis\">\n","         math.NA\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Quantum Physics\">\n","         quant-ph\n","        </span>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p class=\"title is-5 mathjax\">\n","       Numerical Errors in Quantitative System Analysis With Decision Diagrams\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"authors\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Authors:\n","       </span>\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Brand%2C+S\">\n","        Sebastiaan Brand\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Quist%2C+A\">\n","        Arend-Jan Quist\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=van+Dijk%2C+R+M+K\">\n","        Richard M.

While many of the DDs used in the probabilistic and quantum domains make use of floating-point numbers, this is not without challenges. Floating-point computations are subject to small rounding errors, which can affect both the correctness of the result and the effectiveness of the DD's compression. In this paper, we investigate the numerical stability, i.e. the robustness of an algorithm to small numerical errors, of matrix-vector multiplication with multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs). Matrix-vector multiplication is of particular interest because it is the function that computes successor states for both probabilistic and quantum systems. We prove that the MTBDD matrix-vector multiplication algorithm can be made numerically stable under certain conditions, although in many practical implementations of MTBDDs these conditions are not met.

The present study introduces a frequency-domain framework that reconciles these formulations within a single constructive scheme. Starting from Leray-Hopf data, a scale-dependent regularization operator combining mollification, Sobolev extension, and the Leray projector produces smooth, divergence-free approximations. Two bounded Fourier multipliers are then defined: an interpolation operator that blends low-frequency weak and high-frequency strong components, and a smoothing operator that yields uniform parabolic gain. Littlewood-Paley analysis, refined Calderon-Zygmund and Schauder estimates, and an explicit Galerkin scheme provide quantitative Hs a priori bounds and a lifespan controlled by the first Stokes eigenvalue. Compactness via the Aubin-Lions lemma and dominated convergence demonstrates that, as the regularization parameter vanishes, the approximations converge to a single velocity field satisfying simultaneously the weak energy identity, the Fujita-Kato mild formulation, and the strong formulation in Hs with s &gt; 3/2. The construction furnishes a unified local solution and supplies operator bounds required for subsequent energy-vorticity bootstraps and global continuation arguments, clarifying the interplay between frequency localization and nonlinear estimates in fluid dynamics.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2507.13356v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none';

Furthermore, we construct all $δ$-Poisson algebra structures on null-filiform associative algebras, and show that they are trivial $δ$-Poisson algebras.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2507.10554v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2507.10554v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         △ Less\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Submitted\n","       </span>\n","       7 June, 2025;\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        originally announced\n","       </span>\n","       July 2025.\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Comments:\n","       </span>\n","       <span class=\"has-text-grey-dark mathjax\">\n","        arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.06295\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        MSC Class:\n","       </span>\n","       17A30; 17A50; 17B63\n","      </p>\n","     </li>\n","     <li class=\"arxiv-result\">\n","      <div class=\"is-marginless\">\n","       <p class=\"list-title is-inline-block\">\n","        <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08826\">\n","         arXiv:2507.08826\n","        </a>\n","        <span>\n","         [\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08826\">\n","          pdf\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ps/2507.08826\">\n","          ps\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/format/2507.08826\">\n","          other\n","         </a>\n","         ]\n","        </span>\n","       </p>\n","       <div class=\"tags is-inline-block\">\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Algebraic Geometry\">\n","         math.AG\n","        </span>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p class=\"title is-5 mathjax\">\n","       Construction of minimal varieties from quasi-smooth weighted complete intersections\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"authors\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Authors:\n","       </span>\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Bie%2C+P\">\n","        Pinxian Bie\n","       </a>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"abstract mathjax\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Abstract\n","       </span>\n","       :\n","       <span class=\"abstract-short has-text-grey-dark mathjax\" id=\"2507.08826v1-abstract-short\" style=\"display: inline;\">\n","        This paper is devoted to the generalization of the construction of minimal varieties from the previous work of Meng Chen, Chen Jiang and Binru Li.

This difficulty arises from the existence of numerous minimizers and, consequently, a vast number of saddle points. These factors make it challenging to predict the location of desired configurations or to forecast the trajectories and pathways leading from an initial condition to the final state. In contrast, experimental observations demonstrate that specific morphologies can be reproducibly obtained in high yield under controlled conditions, even amidst noise. This study investigates the possibility of elucidating the global structure of the free energy landscape and enabling the control of orbits toward desired minimizers without relying on exhaustive brute-force methods. Furthermore, it seeks to mathematically explain the efficacy of certain experimental setups in achieving high-yield outcomes. Focusing on the phase separation of two polymers in a solvent, we conduct a one-dimensional analysis that reveals the global free energy landscape and relaxation-parameter-dependent trajectory behaviors. Two key methodologies are developed: one is a saddle point search method, akin to bifurcation tracking. This method aims to comprehensively identify all saddle points. The other is a strategy that adjusts the relaxation parameters preceding each variable's time derivative, aligning with experimental setups. This approach enables control over trajectory behaviors toward desired structures, overcoming the limitations of steepest descent methods. By tuning these relaxation parameters, uncertainties in trajectory behavior due to inevitable fluctuations can be suppressed. These methodologies collectively offer a mathematical framework that mirrors experimental high-yield phenomena, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2507.08819v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2507.08819v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         △ Less\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Submitted\n","       </span>\n","       28 June, 2025;\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        originally announced\n","       </span>\n","       July 2025.\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Comments:\n","       </span>\n","       <span class=\"has-text-grey-dark mathjax\">\n","        33 pages, 20 figures, 6 tables\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        MSC Class:\n","       </span>\n","       35B38; 37G35; 37L10; 37L20; 37N99; 82D60\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        ACM Class:\n","       </span>\n","       G.1.8\n","      </p>\n","     </li>\n","     <li class=\"arxiv-result\">\n","      <div class=\"is-marginless\">\n","       <p class=\"list-title is-inline-block\">\n","        <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08812\">\n","         arXiv:2507.08812\n","        </a>\n","        <span>\n","         [\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08812\">\n","          pdf\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ps/2507.08812\">\n","          ps\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/format/2507.08812\">\n","          other\n","         </a>\n","         ]\n","        </span>\n","       </p>\n","       <div class=\"tags is-inline-block\">\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Analysis of PDEs\">\n","         math.AP\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Numerical Analysis\">\n","         math.NA\n","        </span>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p class=\"title is-5 mathjax\">\n","       The Divergence-Free Radiant Transform\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"authors\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Authors:\n","       </span>\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Mullaghy%2C+Z\">\n","        Zachary Mullaghy\n","       </a>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"abstract mathjax\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Abstract\n","       </span>\n","       :\n","       <span class=\"abstract-short has-text-grey-dark mathjax\" id=\"2507.08812v1-abstract-short\" style=\"display: inline;\">\n","        This paper presents the rigorous mathematical construction and foundational properties of the Divergence-Free Radiant Transform (DFRT), a spectral transform specifically designed for divergence-free vector fields, with applications in incompressible fluid dynamics and other solenoidal systems.

The DFRT basis functions are constructed using a curl-based formulation that ensures the divergence-free condition is satisfied identically. We define the forward and inverse transforms, prove the Parseval identity, and establish the completeness of the basis. The DFRT coefficient space is equipped with an algebraic structure via a spectral coboundary operator, defined using Wigner 3j and 6j symbols to encode angular momentum coupling. This cohomological structure, and its connection to the Geometric Refinement Transform (GRT), is developed in a companion paper using a bigraded cohomology framework. We derive a modal evolution equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in DFRT coordinates and introduce a persistent regularity class based on cohomological constraints. Finally, we present a variational argument showing that an entropy-maximizing energy distribution leads to exponential decay, offering a new perspective on regularity and singularity prevention in incompressible flows.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2507.08812v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2507.08812v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         △ Less\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Submitted\n","       </span>\n","       25 June, 2025;\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        originally announced\n","       </span>\n","       July 2025.\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        MSC Class:\n","       </span>\n","       65M70; 35Q30; 65N35; 58A12; 76D05; 35B65\n","      </p>\n","     </li>\n","     <li class=\"arxiv-result\">\n","      <div class=\"is-marginless\">\n","       <p class=\"list-title is-inline-block\">\n","        <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08811\">\n","         arXiv:2507.08811\n","        </a>\n","        <span>\n","         [\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08811\">\n","          pdf\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ps/2507.08811\">\n","          ps\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/format/2507.08811\">\n","          other\n","         </a>\n","         ]\n","        </span>\n","       </p>\n","       <div class=\"tags is-inline-block\">\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Statistics Theory\">\n","         math.ST\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Probability\">\n","         math.PR\n","        </span>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p class=\"title is-5 mathjax\">\n","       Optimal estimators for threshold-based quality measures\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"authors\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Authors:\n","       </span>\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Abrams%2C+A\">\n","        Aaron Abrams\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Ganzell%2C+S\">\n","        Sandy Ganzell\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Landau%2C+H\">\n","        Henry Landau\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Landau%2C+Z\">\n","        Zeph Landau\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Pommersheim%2C+J\">\n","        James Pommersheim\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zaslow%2C+E\">\n","        Eric Zaslow\n","       </a>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"abstract mathjax\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Abstract\n","       </span>\n","       :\n","       <span class=\"abstract-short has-text-grey-dark mathjax\" id=\"2507.08811v1-abstract-short\" style=\"display: inline;\">\n","        We consider a problem in parametric estimation: given $n$ samples from an unknown distribution, we want to estimate which distribution, from a given one-parameter family, produced the data.

By contrast, we give an example showing it does not hold for a certain distribution on an infinite tree.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2507.08811v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2507.08811v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         △ Less\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Submitted\n","       </span>\n","       25 June, 2025;\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        originally announced\n","       </span>\n","       July 2025.\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Comments:\n","       </span>\n","       <span class=\"has-text-grey-dark mathjax\">\n","        This is the sixth of eleven old articles being uploaded to arxiv after publication\n","       </span>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Journal ref:\n","       </span>\n","       Journal of Probability and Statistics, vol. 2010, Article ID 752750, 15 pages, 2010\n","      </p>\n","     </li>\n","     <li class=\"arxiv-result\">\n","      <div class=\"is-marginless\">\n","       <p class=\"list-title is-inline-block\">\n","        <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08810\">\n","         arXiv:2507.08810\n","        </a>\n","        <span>\n","         [\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08810\">\n","          pdf\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ps/2507.08810\">\n","          ps\n","         </a>\n","         ,\n","         <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/format/2507.08810\">\n","          other\n","         </a>\n","         ]\n","        </span>\n","       </p>\n","       <div class=\"tags is-inline-block\">\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Probability\">\n","         math.PR\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Mathematical Physics\">\n","         math-ph\n","        </span>\n","        <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Analysis of PDEs\">\n","         math.AP\n","        </span>\n","       </div>\n","      </div>\n","      <p class=\"title is-5 mathjax\">\n","       Stochastic Fractional Navier-Stokes Equations: Finite-Time Blow-up for Vortex Stretch Singularities\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"authors\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Authors:\n","       </span>\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Saucedo%2C+J\">\n","        Joel Saucedo\n","       </a>\n","       ,\n","       <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Lamba%2C+U\">\n","        Uday Lamba\n","       </a>\n","      </p>\n","      <p class=\"abstract mathjax\">\n","       <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">\n","        Abstract\n","       </span>\n","       :\n","       <span class=\"abstract-short has-text-grey-dark mathjax\" id=\"2507.08810v1-abstract-short\" style=\"display: inline;\">\n","        We establish the first finite-time blow-up results for generalized 3D stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations \\[ \\Caputo \\mathbf{u} = -(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} - \\nabla p + ν\\fLaplacian \\mathbf{u} + I^{1-β}[σ(\\mathbf{u}) \\dot{W}], \\quad \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0, \\] with dissipation $(-Δ)^{α/2}$ for $α\\in (1, 3/2)$, Caputo time-memory $\\partial_t^β$, and superlinear noise…\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2507.08810v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'inline'; document.getElementById('2507.08810v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'none';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">\n","         ▽ More\n","        </a>\n","       </span>\n","       <span class=\"abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax\" id=\"2507.08810v1-abstract-full\" style=\"display: none;\">\n","        We establish the first finite-time blow-up results for generalized 3D stochastic fractional Navier-Stokes equations \\[ \\Caputo \\mathbf{u} = -(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} - \\nabla p + ν\\fLaplacian \\mathbf{u} + I^{1-β}[σ(\\mathbf{u}) \\dot{W}], \\quad \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0, \\] with dissipation $(-Δ)^{α/2}$ for $α\\in (1, 3/2)$, Caputo time-memory $\\partial_t^β$, and superlinear noise $|\\mathbf{u}|^{1+γ}$, proving that for a critical window of memory, $β\\in (\\fracα{α+3}, β_c(α,γ))$, the second moment of the vorticity supremum explodes due to a vortex-stretching-driven renewal inequality.

The recommended iterative method provides the solution via a rapidly converging series that readily approaches a closed form solution. The proposed approach is very efficient and essentially perfect for determining exact solutions of nonlinear equations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we examined the extended (2 + 1) dimensional equation for thermophoretic motion, which is based on wrinkle wave movements in graphene sheets supported by a substrate. The implementation of the suggested approach effectively yielded closed-form solutions in terms of exponential functions, hyperbolic functions, trigonometric functions, algebraic functions, and Jacobi elliptic functions, respectively. Three generated solutions illustrated to examine the characteristics of thermophoretic waves in graphene sheets. The proposed method's benefits and drawbacks are also examined. Consequently, unlike previous solutions obtained via the variation of parameters method for nonlinear issues, the solutions presented here are exact and unique.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\"

This difficulty arises from the existence of numerous minimizers and, consequently, a vast number of saddle points. These factors make it challenging to predict the location of desired configurations or to forecast the trajectories and pathways leading from an initial condition to the final state. In contrast, experimental observations demonstrate that specific morphologies can be reproducibly obtained in high yield under controlled conditions, even amidst noise. This study investigates the possibility of elucidating the global structure of the free energy landscape and enabling the control of orbits toward desired minimizers without relying on exhaustive brute-force methods. Furthermore, it seeks to mathematically explain the efficacy of certain experimental setups in achieving high-yield outcomes. Focusing on the phase separation of two polymers in a solvent, we conduct a one-dimensional analysis that reveals the global free energy landscape and relaxation-parameter-dependent trajectory behaviors. Two key methodologies are developed: one is a saddle point search method, akin to bifurcation tracking. This method aims to comprehensively identify all saddle points. The other is a strategy that adjusts the relaxation parameters preceding each variable's time derivative, aligning with experimental setups. This approach enables control over trajectory behaviors toward desired structures, overcoming the limitations of steepest descent methods. By tuning these relaxation parameters, uncertainties in trajectory behavior due to inevitable fluctuations can be suppressed. These methodologies collectively offer a mathematical framework that mirrors experimental high-yield phenomena, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.\n","        <a class=\"is-size-7\" onclick=\"document.getElementById('2507.08819v1-abstract-full').style.display = 'none'; document.getElementById('2507.08819v1-abstract-short').style.display = 'inline';\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">△ Less</a>\n","</span>\n","</p>\n","<p class=\"is-size-7\"><span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">Submitted</span> 28 June, 2025; \n","      <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">originally announced</span> July 2025.\n","      \n","    </p>\n","<p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","<span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">Comments:</span>\n","<span class=\"has-text-grey-dark mathjax\">33 pages, 20 figures, 6 tables</span>\n","</p>\n","<p class=\"comments is-size-7\">\n","<span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">MSC Class:</span>\n","          35B38; 37G35; 37L10; 37L20; 37N99; 82D60\n","        \n","\n","        \n","          <span class=\"has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold\">ACM Class:</span>\n","          G.1.8\n","        \n","      </p>\n","</li>\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["num_paper_1 = paper_1.select_one('p.list-title').get_text(strip=True)\n","num_paper_1"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"tQsQIYDSPZhk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762014670246,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":83,"user":{"displayName":"Christian López Vicente","userId":"07803460066827731831"}},"outputId":"4a04a9e8-48dc-4a03-a726-6cd24785596c"},"id":"tQsQIYDSPZhk","execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'arXiv:2507.08819[pdf,ps,other]'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":32}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tags_paper_1 = paper_1.select('span.tag')\n","tags_paper_1"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KBGKnmsvRkbt","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762014941444,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Christian López Vicente","userId":"07803460066827731831"}},"outputId":"ecae253c-809b-4246-aca3-2a7ff49ffd10"},"id":"KBGKnmsvRkbt","execution_count":41,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[<span class=\"tag is-small is-link tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Soft Condensed Matter\">cond-mat.soft</span>,\n"," <span class=\"tag is-small is-grey tooltip is-tooltip-top\" data-tooltip=\"Dynamical Systems\">math.DS</span>]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":41}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tittle_paper_1 = paper_1.select_one('p.title').get_text(strip=True)\n","tittle_paper_1"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"BXaREA_UQddy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762014943899,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Christian López Vicente","userId":"07803460066827731831"}},"outputId":"714c2537-db24-4893-8a17-afe281f94806"},"id":"BXaREA_UQddy","execution_count":42,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Exploring global landscape of free energy for the coupled Cahn-Hilliard equations'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":42}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["authors_paper_1 = paper_1.select('p.authors a')\n","authors_paper_1"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"uRnvtgjiQnx0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762014997099,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":43,"user":{"displayName":"Christian López Vicente","userId":"07803460066827731831"}},"outputId":"dc878273-d987-431e-a987-ab18234d897b"},"id":"uRnvtgjiQnx0","execution_count":44,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[<a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Kagawa%2C+K\">Keiichiro Kagawa</a>,\n"," <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Watanabe%2C+T\">Takeshi Watanabe</a>,\n"," <a href=\"/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Nishiura%2C+Y\">Yasumasa Nishiura</a>]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":44}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["abstract_short_paper_1 = paper_1.select_one('span.abstract-short').get_text(strip=True)\n","abstract_short_paper_1"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":69},"id":"BB_rvTxaR1vb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762015469915,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Christian López Vicente","userId":"07803460066827731831"}},"outputId":"834f9139-7f5c-41ea-e895-16a162f55a2f"},"id":"BB_rvTxaR1vb","execution_count":59,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Describing the complex landscape of infinite-dimensional free energy is generally a challenging problem.
