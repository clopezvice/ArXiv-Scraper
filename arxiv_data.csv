2505.24868,Consistent line clustering using geometric hypergraphs,"['math.ST', 'stat.ML']","['Kalle Alaluusua', 'Konstantin Avrachenkov', 'B. R. Vinay Kumar', 'Lasse Leskelä']","Traditional data analysis often represents data as a weighted graph with pairwise similarities, but many problems do not naturally fit this framework. In line clustering, points in a Euclidean space must be grouped so that each cluster is well approximated by a line segment. Since any two points define a line, pairwise similarities fail to capture the structure of the problem, necessitating the use of higher-order interactions modeled by geometric hypergraphs. We encode geometry into a 3-uniform hypergraph by treating sets of three points as hyperedges whenever they are approximately collinear. The resulting hypergraph contains information about the underlying line segments, which can then be extracted using community recovery algorithms. In contrast to classical hypergraph block models, latent geometric constraints in this construction introduce significant dependencies between hyperedges, which restricts the applicability of many standard theoretical tools. We aim to determine the fundamental limits of line clustering and evaluate hypergraph-based line clustering methods. To this end, we derive information-theoretic thresholds for exact and almost exact recovery for data generated from intersecting lines on a plane with additive Gaussian noise. We develop a polynomial-time spectral algorithm and show that it succeeds under noise conditions that match the information-theoretic bounds up to a polylogarithmic factor."
2505.24861,A localized consensus-based sampling algorithm,"['math.NA', 'math.OC']","['Arne Bouillon', 'Alexander Bodard', 'Panagiotis Patrinos', 'Dirk Nuyens', 'Giovanni Samaey']","We develop a novel interacting-particle method for sampling from non-Gaussian distributions. As a first step, we propose a new way to derive the consensus-based sampling (CBS) algorithm, starting from ensemble-preconditioned Langevin diffusions. We approximate the target potential by its Moreau envelope, such that the gradient in the Langevin equation can be replaced by a proximal operator. We then approximate the proximal operator by a weighted mean, and finally assume that the initial and target distributions are Gaussian, resulting in the CBS dynamics. If we keep only those approximations that can be justified in the non-Gaussian setting, the result is a new interacting-particle method for sampling, which we call localized consensus-based sampling. We prove that our algorithm is affine-invariant and exact for Gaussian distributions in the mean-field setting. Numerical tests illustrate that localized CBS compares favorably to alternative methods in terms of affine-invariance and performance on non-Gaussian distributions."

Douglas Wright', 'Udoh Akpan']",We consider long range variants of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and in particular allow for particles to interact over arbitrarily long distances. We develop sufficient conditions which allow for the construction of solitary wave solutions.
2505.24821,Asymptotics for the harmonic descent chain and applications to critical beta-splitting trees,"['math.PR', 'math.CO']","['Anna Brandenberger', 'Byron Chin', 'Elchanan Mossel']","Motivated by the connection to a probabilistic model of phylogenetic trees introduced by Aldous, we study the recursive sequence governed by the rule $x_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{h_{n-1}(n-i)} x_i$ where $h_{n-1} = \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1/j$, known as the harmonic descent chain. While it is known that this sequence converges to an explicit limit $x$, not much is known about the rate of convergence. We first show that a class of recursive sequences including the above are decreasing and use this to bound the rate of convergence. Moreover, for the harmonic descent chain we prove the asymptotic $x_n - x = n^{-γ_* + o(1)}$ for an implicit exponent $γ_*$. As a consequence, we deduce central limit theorems for various statistics of the critical beta-splitting random tree. This answers a number of questions of Aldous, Janson, and Pittel."
2505.24815,Convex Approximations of Random Constrained Markov Decision Processes,"['math.OC', 'eess.SY']","['V Varagapriya', 'Vikas Vikram Singh', 'Abdel Lisser']","Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are used as a decision-making framework to study the long-run performance of a stochastic system. It is well-known that a stationary optimal policy of a CMDP problem under discounted cost criterion can be obtained by solving a linear programming problem when running costs and transition probabilities are exactly known. In this paper, we consider a discounted cost CMDP problem where the running costs and transition probabilities are defined using random variables. Consequently, both the objective function and constraints become random. We use chance constraints to model these uncertainties and formulate the uncertain CMDP problem as a joint chance-constrained Markov decision process (JCCMDP). Under random running costs, we assume that the dependency among random constraint vectors is driven by a Gumbel-Hougaard copula. Using standard probability inequalities, we construct convex upper bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem under certain conditions on random running costs. In addition, we propose a linear programming problem whose optimal value gives a lower bound to the optimal value of the JCCMDP problem. When both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we define the latter variables as a sum of their means and random perturbations. Under mild conditions on the random perturbations and random running costs, we construct convex upper and lower bound approximations of the JCCMDP problem. We analyse the quality of the derived bounds through numerical experiments on a queueing control problem for random running costs. For the case when both running costs and transition probabilities are random, we choose randomly generated Markov decision problems called Garnets for numerical experiments."
2505.24811,Locally Differentially Private Two-Sample Testing,"['math.ST', 'stat.ME']","['Alexander Kent', 'Thomas B. Berrett', 'Yi Yu']","We consider the problem of two-sample testing under a local differential privacy constraint where a permutation procedure is used to calibrate the tests. We develop testing procedures which are optimal up to logarithmic factors, for general discrete distributions and continuous distributions subject to a smoothness constraint. Both non-interactive and interactive tests are considered, and we show allowing interactivity results in an improvement in the minimax separation rates. Our results show that permutation procedures remain feasible in practice under local privacy constraints, despite the inability to permute the non-private data directly and only the private views. Further, through a refined theoretical analysis of the permutation procedure, we are able to avoid an equal sample size assumption which has been made in the permutation testing literature regardless of the presence of the privacy constraint. Lastly, we conduct numerical experiments which demonstrate the performance of our proposed test and verify the theoretical findings, especially the improved performance enabled by allowing interactivity."
2505.24794,Cardinalities of the total number of independent sets,['math.CO'],"['Benedek Kovács', 'Zoltán Lóránt Nagy']","We study the set of numbers the total number of independent sets can admit in $n$-vertex graphs. In this paper, we prove that the cardinality $\mathcal{N}i(n)$ of this set is very close to $2^n$ in the following sense: $\mathcal{N}i(n)/2^n = O(n^{-1/5})$ while for infinitely many $n$, we have $\log_2(\mathcal{N}i(n)/2^n)\ge -2^{(1+o(1)\sqrt{\log_2 n}}$. This set is also precisely the set of possible values of the independence polynomial $I_G(x)$ at $x=1$ for $n$-vertex graphs $G$. As an application, we address an additive combinatorial problem on subsets of a given vector space that avoid certain intersection patterns with respect to subspaces."
2505.24793,AFIRE: Accurate and Fast Image Reconstruction Algorithm for Geometric-inconsistent Multispectral CT,"['math.NA', 'physics.med-ph']","['Yu Gao', 'Chong Chen']","For nonlinear multispectral computed tomography (CT), accurate and fast image reconstruction is challenging when the scanning geometries under different X-ray energy spectra are inconsistent or mismatched. Motivated by this, we propose an Accurate and Fast Image REconstruction (AFIRE) algorithm to address such problems in the case of mildly full scan. From the continuous (resp. discrete) setting, we discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on these insights, the AFIRE algorithm is proposed by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistent dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated."
2505.24762,Branched $α$-combinatorial Ricci flows on closed surfaces with Euler characteristic $χ\le 0$,['math.DG'],"['Wenjun Li', 'Rongyuan Liu', 'Guohao Chen', 'Aijin Lin']","In this paper we introduce the branched $α$-flows on closed surfaces with Euler characteristic \(χ\leq 0\). Based on the strict convexity of the branched $α$-potentials, we establish the long time existence and convergence of the solutions to the branched $α$-flows, which generalizes Ge and Xu's main results \cite{2015,2015A} on the $α$-flows. In addtion, we study the prescribed curvature problems under the relaxed precondition $χ(M)\in \mathbb{Z}$ via alternative $α$-flows, establishing admissibility conditions for prescribed curvatures and their exponential convergence to target metrics."
2505.24761,"On Strong Markushevich bases $\{t^{λ_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in their closed span in $L^2 (0, 1)$ and characterizing a subspace of $H^2 (\mathbb{D})$","['math.FA', 'math.CV']",['Elias Zikkos'],"Let $Λ=\{λ_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive real numbers such that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{λ_n}<\infty$ and $\inf(λ_{n+1}-λ_n)>0$. We investigate properties of the closed span of the system $\{t^{λ_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $L^2 (0,1)$, denoted by $\overline{M_Λ}$, and of the unique biorthogonal family $\{r_n (t)\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ to the system $\{t^{λ_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\overline{M_Λ}$. We show that the system $\{t^{λ_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a strong Markushevich basis in $\overline{M_Λ}$ and we obtain a series representation for functions in $\overline{M_Λ}$. We also construct a general class of operators on $\overline{M_Λ}$ that admit spectral synthesis. In particular, for all $ρ\in (0,1)$ the operator $T_ρ(f)=f(ρx)$ on $\overline{M_Λ}$ admits spectral synthesis. In addition, we characterize a certain subspace of the classical Hardy space $H^2 (\mathbb{D})$. Under the extra assumption that $Λ\subset\mathbb{N}$, let $H^2(\mathbb{D}, Λ)$ consist of functions $f$ in $H^2(\mathbb{D})$ so that the Fourier coefficients $c_n$ of the boundary function $f(e^{iθ})$ vanish for all $n\notin Λ$. We prove that $f\in H^2(\mathbb{D}, Λ)$ if and only if $f\in\overline{M_Λ}$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left| \langle f, r_n\rangle \right|^2<\infty$, where $\langle f, g\rangle= \int_{0}^{1} f(t)\cdot \overline{g(t)}\, dt$."
2505.24752,On Noether's Degree Bound for Finite Group Schemes,['math.AC'],"['Gregor Kemper', 'Christian Liedtke', 'Christiane Ott']","This paper establishes Noether's classical degree bound $β(G) \le |G|$ for finite and linearly reductive group schemes. On the other hand, we provide examples of infinitesimal group schemes where $β(G)$ is unbounded. We also generalize Molien's formula to finite and linearly reductive group schemes."
2505.24748,Equidistribution and arithmetic $Λ$-distributions,"['math.NT', 'math.AG']","['Matthew Bertucci', 'Sean Howe']","We formulate an abstract notion of equidistribution for families of $λ$-probability spaces parameterized by admissible $\mathbb{Z}$-sets. Under the assumption of equidistribution, we show that the $σ$-moment generating functions of certain infinite sums of random variables can be computed as motivic Euler products. Combining this result with earlier generalizations of Poonen's sieve, we compute the asymptotic $Λ$-distributions for several natural families of function field $L$-functions and zeta functions."
2505.24744,Neural Network-based Universal Formulas for Control,['math.OC'],"['Pol Mestres', 'Jorge Cortés', 'Eduardo D. Sontag']","We study the problem of designing a controller that satisfies an arbitrary number of affine inequalities at every point in the state space. This is motivated by the use of guardrails in autonomous systems. Indeed, a variety of key control objectives, such as stability, safety, and input saturation, are guaranteed by closed-loop systems whose controllers satisfy such inequalities. Many works in the literature design such controllers as the solution to a state-dependent quadratic program (QP) whose constraints are precisely the inequalities. When the input dimension and number of constraints are high, computing a solution of this QP in real time can become computationally burdensome. Additionally, the solution of such optimization problems is not smooth in general, which can degrade the performance of the system. This paper provides a novel method to design a smooth controller that satisfies an arbitrary number of affine constraints. This why we refer to it as a universal formula for control. The controller is given at every state as the minimizer of a strictly convex function. To avoid computing the minimizer of such function in real time, we introduce a method based on neural networks (NN) to approximate the controller. Remarkably, this NN can be used to solve the controller design problem for any task with less than a fixed input dimension and number of affine constraints, and is completely independent of the state dimension. Additionally, we show that the NN-based controller only needs to be trained with datapoints from a compact set in the state space, which significantly simplifies the training process. Various simulations showcase the performance of the proposed solution."
2505.24735,A Computational Search for Minimal Obstruction Graphs for the Lovász--Schrijver SDP Hierarchy,"['math.CO', 'cs.DM', 'math.OC']","['Yu Hin Au', 'Levent Tunçel']","We study the lift-and-project relaxations of the stable set polytope of graphs generated by $\text{LS}_+$, the SDP lift-and-project operator devised by Lovász and Schrijver. In particular, we focus on searching for $\ell$-minimal graphs, which are graphs on $3\ell$ vertices whose stable set polytope has rank $\ell$ with respect to $\text{LS}_+$. These are the graphs which are the most challenging for the $\text{LS}_+$ operator according to one of the main complexity measures (smallest graphs with largest $\text{LS}_+$-rank). We introduce the notion of $\text{LS}_+$ certificate packages, which is a framework that allows for efficient and reliable verification of membership of points in $\text{LS}_+$-relaxations. Using this framework, we present numerical certificates which (combined with other results) show that there are at least $49$ $3$-minimal graphs, as well as over $4000$ $4$-minimal graphs. This marks a significant leap from the $14$ $3$-minimal and $588$ $4$-minimal graphs known before this work, with many of the newly-discovered graphs containing novel structures which helps enrich and recalibrate our understanding of $\ell$-minimal graphs. Some of this computational work leads to interesting conjectures. We also find all of the smallest vertex-transitive graphs with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ for every $\ell \leq 4$."
2505.24734,Real syntomic cohomology,"['math.AT', 'math.KT']","['Gabriel Angelini-Knoll', 'Hana Jia Kong', 'J. D. Quigley']","We introduce a theory of syntomic cohomology for ring spectra with involution, which we call Real syntomic cohomology. We show that our construction extends the theory of syntomic cohomology for rings with involution due to Park. Our construction also refines syntomic cohomology as developed by Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze, Morin, Bhatt--Lurie, and Hahn--Raksit--Wilson. We compute the Real syntomic cohomology of Real topological K-theory and topological modular forms with level structure."

2505.24719,On the geometry of holomorphic curves and complex surface,['math.DG'],"['Amanda Dias Falqueto', 'Farid Tari']","We investigate the geometry of holomorphic curves and complex surfaces from the perspective of singularity theory. We show that, with a suitable choice of a complex bilinear symmetric form, the families of functions and mappings that measure the contact between curves or surfaces and model objects become holomorphic. This allows the application of singularity theory, yielding analogues of classical results from the real case. Our approach enables the definition of geometric invariants of curves, which we call the $C$-curvature and $C$-torsion, as well as surface invariants such as the $C$-principal curvature and $C$-Gaussian curvature. It also gives geometric meaning to the complexification of of the families measuring contact of analytic surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$ with lines, planes and spheres."
2505.24707,Vulnerability Measures and Zagreb Indices of Graphs,['math.CO'],"['Sanju Vaidya', 'Cheng Chang']","This paper establishes sharp bounds for the vulnerability measures of closeness and generalized closeness in graphs and identifies graphs that attain these bounds. It further develops bounds incorporating Zagreb indices for triangle- and quadrangle-free graphs, yielding formulas for closeness and generalized closeness in such graphs with diameter at most 3. Moreover, using Zagreb indices, we derive bounds for trees and connected graphs with girth at least 7, which are attained by graphs with diameter at most 4. Finally, formulas for closeness and generalized closeness in specific trees are established using Zagreb indices."
2505.24702,Relative non-pluripolar product of currents on compact Hermitian manifolds,"['math.DG', 'math.CV']","['Zhenghao Li', 'Shuang Su']","On a class of compact Hermitian manifolds including compact Kähler manifolds, we prove that the the relative non-pluripolar product is always well-defined. We also prove the monotonicity of the relative non-pluripolar product in terms of masses on such manifolds."
2505.24699,Geometric Littlewood-Offord problems via lattice point counting,"['math.CO', 'math.NT', 'math.PR']","['Alexandr Grebennikov', 'Matthew Kwan']","Consider nonzero vectors $a_{1},\dots,a_{n}\in\mathbb{C}^{k}$, independent Rademacher random variables $ξ_{1},\dots,ξ_{n}$, and a set $S\subseteq\mathbb{C}^{k}$. What upper bounds can we prove on the probability that the random sum $ξ_{1}a_{1}+\dots+ξ_{n}a_{n}$ lies in $S$? We develop a general framework that allows us to reduce problems of this type to counting lattice points in $S$. We apply this framework with known results from diophantine geometry to prove various bounds when $S$ is a set of points in convex position, an algebraic variety, or a semialgebraic set. In particular, this resolves conjectures of Fox-Kwan-Spink and Kwan-Sauermann.
  We also obtain some corollaries for the polynomial Littlewood-Offord problem, for polynomials that have bounded Chow rank (i.e., can be written as a polynomial of a bounded number of linear forms). For example, one of our results confirms a conjecture of Nguyen and Vu in the special case of polynomials with bounded Chow rank: if a bounded-degree polynomial $F\in\mathbb{C}[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]$ has bounded Chow rank and ''robustly depends on at least $b$ of its variables'', then $\mathbb{P}[F(ξ_{1},\dots,ξ_{n})=0]\le O(1/\sqrt{b})$. We also prove significantly stronger bounds when $F$ is ''robustly irreducible'', towards a conjecture of Costello."

Assuming the stable Hypothesis H of Fiorenza--Sati--Schreiber, we use the resulting obstruction theory to prove that the Chern--Simons term in the effective action of M-theory is well defined. In particular, we do not assume the presence of an $E_8$-gauge field."
2505.24670,The Schur multiplier norm and its dual norm,"['math.FA', 'math.OA']",['Erik Christensen'],"We present a formula for the Schur multiplier norm of a complex self-adjoint matrix, and a formula for the norm, which is dual to the Schur multiplier norm, of a self-adjoint matrix.
  For a complex self-adjoint $n \times n $ matrix $X$ we show that its Schur multiplier norm is determined by $$ \|X\|_S = \min \{\, \|\mathrm{diag}(P)\|_\infty \, :\, - P \leq X \leq P \, \}.$$
  The dual space of $( M_n(\bc), \|.\|_S)$ is $(M_n(\bc), \|.\|_{cbB}).$ For $X=X^*:$ $$ \|X\|_{cbB} = \min \{ \, \mathrm{Tr}_n\big(Δ(λ)\big)\, :\, λ\in \br^n, \, - Δ(λ) \leq X \leq Δ(λ)\,\}. $$"
2505.24662,"From Group Operations to Geometric Structures: Amalgamations, HNN-Extensions, and Twisting in Coset Geometries","['math.GR', 'math.CO', 'math.GT']","['Claudio Alexandre Piedade', 'Philippe Tranchida']","Coset incidence geometries, introduced by Jacques Tits, provide a versatile framework for studying the interplay between group theory and geometry.
  In this article, we build upon that idea by extending classical group-theoretic constructions (amalgamated products, HNN-extensions, semi-direct products, and twisting) to the setting of coset geometries. This gives a general way to glue together incidence geometries in various ways. This provides a general framework for combining or gluing incidence geometries in different ways while preserving essential properties such as flag-transitivity and residual connectedness.
  Using these techniques, we analyze families of Shephard groups, which generalize both Coxeter and Artin-Tits groups, and their associated simplicial complexes.
  Our results also point to the existence of a Bass-Serre theory for coset geometries and of a fundamental geometry of a graph of coset geometries."
2505.24657,A note on multi-transitivity in non-autonomous discrete systems,['math.DS'],['Hongbo Zeng'],"This paper is concerned with some stronger forms of transitivity in non-autonomous discrete systems$(f_{ 1,\infty})$ generated by a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous self maps. Firstly, we present two counterexamples to show that Theorem 3.1 obtained by Salman and Das in [Multi-transitivity in nonautonomous discrete systems Topol. Appl. 278(2020)107237] is not true. Then, we introduce and study mildly mixing in non-autonomous discrete systems, which is stronger than mixing. We obtain that multi-transitivity implies Li-Yorke chaos and that mildly mixing implies multi-transitivity, which answer the open problems 1 and 2 in the paper above. Additionally, we give a counterexample which shows that Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 2.4 given by Sharma and Raghav in [On dynamics generated by a uniformly convergent sequence of maps Topol. Appl. 247 (2018)81-90] are both incorrect and give the correct proofs of them. Finally, some counterexamples are constructed justifying that some results related to stronger forms of transitivity which are true for autonomous systems but fail in non-autonomous systems, and establish a sufficient condition under which the results still hold in non-autonomous systems."
2505.24648,Dicritical divisors and hypercurvettes,['math.AG'],"['Enrique Artal Bartolo', 'Willem Veys']","Germs of rational functions~$h$ on points $p$ of smooth varieties~$S$ define germs of rational maps to the projective line. Assume that $p$ is in the indeterminacy locus of $h$. If $π:\hat{S}\to S$ is a birational map which is an isomorphism outside $p$, then $h$ lifts to a germ of a rational map on $(\hat{S}, π^{-1}(p))$. The exceptional components $E_i$ of $π^{-1}(p)$ are classified according to the restriction of (the lift of) $h$ to $E_i$; the dicritical components are those where this restriction induces a dominant map. In a series of papers, Abhyankar and the first named author studied this setting in dimension $2$, where the main result is that, for any given $π$, there is a rational function $h$ with a prescribed subset of exceptional components that are dicritical of some given degree. The concept of curvette of an exceptional component played a key role in the proof. The second named author extended previously the concept of curvette to the higher dimensional case. Here we use this concept to generalize the above result to arbitrary dimension."

Specifically, we study a one-dimensional two-phase Stefan-like problem which contains a non-local integral operator in the equation describing the temperature distribution of the solid. We will prove the local well-posedness of this free boundary problem combining the Banach fixed-point theorem and classical parabolic theory.

We show that there is a universal solution, recovering a construction of Tamarkin known also as ``enhanced sheaves''. The universality property implies that the category of coefficients of this theory is, in a suitable sense, a nontrivial $\mathbb R_{>0}$-torsor over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb Z)$."

In this paper, we use a classical result of Mader (1972) to establish a weak version of the graph complement conjecture for all key minimum rank parameters. In addition, again using the same result of Mader, we present some extremal resolutions of the $δ$-conjecture. Furthermore, we incorporate the assumption of the $δ$-conjecture and extensive work on graph degeneracy to improve the bound in the weak version of the graph complement conjecture. We conclude with a list of conjectured bounds on the positive semidefinite variant of the Colin de Verdière number."

The performance of DeePC relies on optimizing its hyperparameters, especially in noisy systems where the optimal hyperparameters adapt over time. Existing hyperparameter tuning approaches for DeePC are more than often computationally inefficient or overly conservative. This paper proposes an adaptive DeePC where we guide its hyperparameters adaption through reinforcement learning. We start with establishing the relationship between the system I/O behavior and DeePC hyperparameters. Then we formulate the hyperparameter tuning as a sequential decision-making problem, and we address the decision-making through reinforcement learning. We implement offline training to gain a reinforcement learning model, and we integrate the trained model with DeePC to adjust its hyperparameters adaptively in real time. We conduct numerical simulations with diverse noisy conditions, and the results demonstrate the identification of near-optimal hyperparameters and the robustness of the proposed approach against noises in the control."

As in \cite{BK1,BK2} we again wish to study here counting problems that are inspired by exhilarating advances in arithmetic statistics, and also partly by point-counting results of Narkiewicz on totally complex $K$-periodic points and of Adam-Fares on $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$-periodic points (orbits) in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any given prime $p\geq 3$ and any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, the average number of distinct fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ (modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$) is bounded (if $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\setminus\{1, p\}$) or zero or unbounded (if $\ell \in \{1, p\}$) as $c\to \infty$. Motivated further by an $\mathbb{F}_{p}(t)$-periodic point-counting result of Benedetto, we also find that the average number in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-setting behaves in the same way as in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-setting. Finally, we then apply counting and statistical results from arithmetic statistics to immediately deduce here several counting and statistical results."
2505.24562,Gravity driven traveling bore wave solutions to the free boundary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,['math.AP'],"['Noah Stevenson', 'Ian Tice']","We give the first mathematical construction of two-dimensional traveling bore wave solutions to the free boundary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a single finite depth layer of constant density fluid. Our construction is based on a rigorous justification of the formal shallow water limit, which postulates that in a certain scaling regime the full free boundary traveling Navier-Stokes system of PDEs reduces to a governing system of ODEs. We find heteroclinic orbits solving these ODEs and, through a delicate fixed point argument employing the Stokes problem in thin domains and a nonautonomous orbital perturbation theory, use these ODE solutions as the germs from which we build bore PDE solutions for sufficiently shallow layers."

2505.24548,Asymptotic version of the parametrix method for Markov chains converging to diffusions,['math.PR'],"['I. Bitter', 'V. Konakov']","The paper presents a generalization of the local limit theorem on the convergence of inhomogeneous Markov chains to the diffusion limit for the case where the corresponding process coefficients satisfy weak regularity conditions and coincide only asymptotically. In particular, the drift coefficients considered by us can be unbounded with at most linear growth, and the estimates reflect the transfer of the terminal state by an unbounded trend through the corresponding deterministic flow. Our approach is based on the study of the uniform distance between the transition densities of a given inhomogeneous Markov chain and the limit diffusion process, and the convergence rate estimate is obtained using the classical local limit theorem and parametrix-type stability estimates."
2505.24546,Weil polynomials of small degree,['math.NT'],['Stefano Marseglia'],"Honda and Tate showed that the isogeny classes of abelian varieties of dimension $g$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ are classified in terms of $q$-Weil polynomials of degree $2g$, that is, monic integer polynomials whose set of complex roots consists of $g$ conjugate pairs of absolute value $\sqrt{q}$. There are descriptions of the space of such polynomials for $g \leq 5$, but for $g=3$, $4$ and $5$, these results contain mistakes. We correct these statements. Our proofs build on a criterion that determines when a real polynomial has only real roots in terms of the non-necessarily distinct roots of its first derivative."

This framework eliminates several restrictive assumptions -- such as the need for definability, openness, or f-invariance of subspaces -- thereby allowing broader applicability. We also present a natural combinatorial adaptation of the fixed point index that extends the combinatorial Lefschetz number. This extension yields new topological and homotopical invariance results and facilitates the integration of real-valued functions with respect to fixed points."
2505.24526,Spaces with the maximal projection constant revisited,['math.FA'],['Tomasz Kobos'],"Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer such that an equiangular set of vectors $w_1, \ldots, w_d$ of the maximal possible cardinality (in relation to the the general Gerzon upper bound) exists in $\mathbb{K}^n$, where $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ (i.e. $d=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ in the real and $d=n^2$ in the complex case). We provide a complete characterization of $n$-dimensional normed spaces $X$ having a maximal absolute projection constant among all $n$-dimensional normed spaces over $\mathbb{K}$. The characterization states that $X$ has a maximal projection constant if and only if it is isometric to a space, for which the unit ball of the dual space is contained between the absolutely convex hull of the vectors $w_1, \ldots, w_d$ and an appropriately rescaled zonotope generated by the same vectors. As a consequence, we obtain that in the considered situations, the case of $n=2$ and $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ is the only one, where there is a unique norm in $\mathbb{K}^n$ (up to an isometry) with the maximal projection constant. In this case, the unit ball is an affine regular hexagon in $\mathbb{R}^2$."

2505.24504,Jacobian-free Multigrid Preconditioner for Discontinuous Galerkin Methods applied to Numerical Weather Prediction,"['math.NA', 'physics.comp-ph']","['Philipp Birken', 'Andreas Dedner', 'Robert Klöfkorn']","Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are promising high order discretizations for unsteady compressible flows. Here, we focus on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). These flows are characterized by a fine resolution in $z$-direction and low Mach numbers, making the system stiff. Thus, implicit time integration is required and for this a fast, highly parallel, low-memory iterative solver for the resulting algebraic systems. As a basic framework, we use inexact Jacobian-Free Newton-GMRES with a preconditioner.
  For low order finite volume discretizations, multigrid methods have been successfully applied to steady and unsteady fluid flows. However, for high order DG methods, such solvers are currently lacking. %The lack of efficient solvers suitable for contemporary computer architectures inhibits wider adoption of DG methods. This motivates our research to construct a Jacobian-free precondtioner for high order DG discretizations. The preconditioner is based on a multigrid method constructed for a low order finite volume discretization defined on a subgrid of the DG mesh. We design a computationally efficient and mass conservative mapping between the grids. As smoothers, explicit Runge-Kutta pseudo time iterations are used, which can be implemented in parallel in a Jacobian-free low-memory manner.
  We consider DG Methods for the Euler equations and for viscous flow equations in 2D, both with gravity, in a well balanced formulation. Numerical experiments in the software framework DUNE-FEM on atmospheric flow problems show the benefit of this approach."

2505.24494,The Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity,['math.DG'],"['Xia Zhao', 'Peibiao Zhao']","P. Salani [Adv. Math., 229 (2012)] introduced the $k$-torsional rigidity associated with a $k$-Hessian equation and obtained the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities $w.r.t.$ the torsional rigidity in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Following this work, we first construct, in the present paper, a Hadamard variational formula for the $k$-torsional rigidity with $1\leq k\leq n-1$, then we can deduce a $k$-torsional measure from the Hadamard variational formula. Based on the $k$-torsional measure, we propose the Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity and confirm the existence of its smooth non-even solutions by the method of a curvature flow. Specially, a new proof method for the uniform lower bound estimation in the $C^0$ estimation for the solution to the curvature flow is presented with the help of invariant functional $Φ(Ω_t)$."

Recent developments in understanding weight systems arising from Lie algebras are based on extending these weight systems from chord diagrams (which can be interpreted as involutions without fixed points, considered modulo cyclic shifts) to arbitrary permutations (also modulo cyclic shifts). We suggest relations for functions on permutations, which generalize Vassiliev's relations. We show that the $gl$- and $so$- weight systems satisfy these relations. We also analyze certain properties of these weight systems and study realted Hopf algebras of permutations."

This question can also be framed as the maximum number of edges of an outer $k$-planar graph on $n$ vertices. We outline several approaches to tackle the problem with the best approach yielding an upper bound of $(\sqrt{2}+\varepsilon)\sqrt{k}n$ edges (with $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ for sufficiently large $k$). We further investigate the case where the points are arbitrarily bicolored and segments always connect two different colors (i.e., the corresponding graph has to be bipartite). To this end, we also consider the maximum cut problem for the circulant graph $C_n^{1,2,\dots,r}$ which might be of independent interest."

2505.24464,Distributed gradient methods under heavy-tailed communication noise,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']","['Manojlo Vukovic', 'Dusan Jakovetic', 'Dragana Bajovic', 'Soummya Kar']","We consider a standard distributed optimization problem in which networked nodes collaboratively minimize the sum of their locally known convex costs. For this setting, we address for the first time the fundamental problem of design and analysis of distributed methods to solve the above problem when inter-node communication is subject to \emph{heavy-tailed} noise. Heavy-tailed noise is highly relevant and frequently arises in densely deployed wireless sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, we design a distributed gradient-type method that features a carefully balanced mixed time-scale time-varying consensus and gradient contribution step sizes and a bounded nonlinear operator on the consensus update to limit the effect of heavy-tailed noise. Assuming heterogeneous strongly convex local costs with mutually different minimizers that are arbitrarily far apart, we show that the proposed method converges to a neighborhood of the network-wide problem solution in the mean squared error (MSE) sense, and we also characterize the corresponding convergence rate. We further show that the asymptotic MSE can be made arbitrarily small through consensus step-size tuning, possibly at the cost of slowing down the transient error decay. Numerical experiments corroborate our findings and demonstrate the resilience of the proposed method to heavy-tailed (and infinite variance) communication noise. They also show that existing distributed methods, designed for finite-communication-noise-variance settings, fail in the presence of infinite variance noise."

2505.24430,Some Properties of Twisted Chevalley Groups,['math.GR'],['Deep H. Makadiya'],"This thesis investigates certain structural properties of twisted Chevalley groups over commutative rings, focusing on three key problems.
  Let $R$ be a commutative ring satisfying mild conditions. Let $G_{π,σ} (Φ, R)$ denote a twisted Chevalley group over $R$, and let $E'_{π, σ} (Φ, R)$ denote its elementary subgroup. The first problem concerns the normality of $E'_{π, σ} (Φ, R, J)$, the relative elementary subgroups at level $J$, in the group $G_{π, σ} (Φ, R)$. The second problem addresses the classification of the subgroups of $G_{π, σ}(Φ, R)$ that are normalized by $E'_{π, σ}(Φ, R)$. This classification provides a comprehensive characterization of the normal subgroups of $E'_{π, σ}(Φ, R)$. Lastly, the third problem investigates the normalizers of $E'_{π, σ}(Φ, R)$ and $G_{π, σ}(Φ, R)$ in the bigger group $G_{π, σ}(Φ, S)$, where $S$ is a ring extension of $R$. We prove that these normalizers coincide. Moreover, for groups of adjoint type, we show that they are precisely equal to $G_{π, σ}(Φ, R)$."

Uniqueness arises only in some convex extreme configurations. Rational inner functions in a polydisk are the best understood examples in this sense. We analyze the continuity of global solutions as functions of the finite interpolation data in neighbourhoods of elements distinguished by this uniqueness property. Our study covers rational inner or Cayley rational inner functions in the polydisk and automorphisms of the Euclidean ball. The proof of the main superresolution result is derived from optimization theory techniques and volume estimates of sublevel sets of real polynomials, both emerging from Markov's multivariable moment problem."
2505.24418,Front propagation on a general metric graph,['math.AP'],"['Hiroshi Matano', 'Shuichi Jimbo']","We consider a bistable reaction-diffusion equation on a metric graph that is a generalization of the so-called star graphs. More precisely, our graph $Ω$ consists of a bounded finite metric graph $D$ of arbitrary configuration and a finite number of branches $Ω_1,\ldots,Ω_N\,(N\geq 2)$ of infinite length emanating from some of the vertices of $D$. Each $Ω_i\,(i=1,\ldots,N)$ is called an ``outer path''. Our goal is to investigate the behavior of the front coming from infinity along a given outer path $Ω_i$ and to discuss whether or not the front propagates into other outer paths $Ω_j\,(j\ne i)$. Unlike the case of star graphs, where $D$ is a single vertex, the dynamics of solutions can be far more complex and may depend sensitively on the configuration of the center graph $D$. We first focus on general principles that hold regardless of the structure of the center graph $D$. Among other things, we introduce the notion ``limit profile'', which allows us to define ``propagation'' and ``blocking'' without ambiguity, then we prove transient properties, that is, propagation $Ω_i\to Ω_j$ and $Ω_j\to Ω_k$ imply propagation $Ω_i\to Ω_k$. Next we consider perturbations of the graph $D$ while fixing the outer paths $Ω_1,\ldots,Ω_N$ and prove that if, for a given choice of $i,j$, propagation $Ω_i\to Ω_j$ occurs for a graph $D$, then the same holds for any graph $D'$ that is sufficiently close to $D$ (robustness under perturbation). We also consider several specific classes of graphs, such as those with a ``reservoir'' type subgraph, and study their intriguing properties."

Finite incremental gains provide a quantitative measure of robustness for trajectories, and will ensure that all pairs of trajectories will converge to a fixed point or will diverge together in the absence of an applied input. Upper-bounds on these incremental gains can be computed through linear programming. Computation and regulation of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ incremental gains are verified by numerical examples."

Our algorithm is inspired by the fixed-point iterative scheme of Álvarez-Esteban et al. (2016) whose convergence to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter relies on obtaining exact optimal transport (OT) maps. However, typically in practice, OT maps are only approximately computed and exact computation of OT maps between continuous probability measures is only tractable for certain restrictive parametric families. To circumvent the need to compute exact OT maps between general non-parametric measures, we develop a tailored iterative scheme that utilizes consistent estimators of the OT maps instead of the exact OT maps. This gives rise to a computationally tractable stochastic fixed-point algorithm which is provably convergent to the 2-Wasserstein barycenter. Our algorithm remarkably does not restrict the support of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter to be any fixed finite set and can be implemented in a distributed computing environment, which makes it suitable for large-scale data aggregation problems. In our numerical experiments, we propose a method of generating non-trivial instances of 2-Wasserstein barycenter problems where the ground-truth barycenter measure is known. Our numerical results showcase the capability of our algorithm in developing high-quality approximations of the 2-Wasserstein barycenter, as well as its superiority over state-of-the-art methods based on generative neural networks in terms of accuracy, stability, and efficiency."

We characterize almost $ω$-Bach solitons, when the potential vector field of the soliton generates an infinitesimal harmonic transformation or is an affine conformal vector field, or is a projective vector field or is a Killing vector field, when the $ω$-Bach tensor is divergence free, or is a harmonic $1$ form or is a Killing $1$-form. We generalize some of the results obtained by P. T. Ho and A. Ghosh.

Our gradient almost $ω$-Bach solitons generalize the almost Bach solitons on $\mathbb{R}^2\times{\mathbb H}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^2\times{\mathbb S}^2$ found by P. T. Ho.

This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of recovering the location and shape of the obstacle from near-field data generated by infinitely many incident point source waves at a fixed energy. The incident point sources and the receivers for recording scattered signals are both located on a spherical closed surface, on which an outgoing-to-incoming operator is defined for facilitating the factorization of the near-field operator. Numerical examples in 2D are presented to show the validity and accuracy of the inversion algorithm."
2505.24283,Characterizing the limiting critical Potts measures on locally regular-tree-like expander graphs,"['math.PR', 'math-ph']","['Hang Du', 'Yanxin Zhou']","For any integers $d,q\ge 3$, we consider the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model with an external field on a sequence of expander graphs that converges to the $d$-regular tree $\mathtt{T}_d$ in the Benjamini-Schramm sense. We show that along the critical line, any subsequential local weak limit of the Potts measures is a mixture of the free and wired Potts Gibbs measures on $\mathtt{T}_d$. Furthermore, we show the possibility of an arbitrary extent of strong phase coexistence: for any $α\in [0,1]$, there exists a sequence of locally $\mathtt{T}_d$-like expander graphs $\{G_n\}$, such that the Potts measures on $\{G_n\}$ locally weakly converges to the $(α,1-α)$-mixture of the free and wired Potts Gibbs measures. Our result extends results of \cite{HJP23} which restrict to the zero-field case and also require $q$ to be sufficiently large relative to $d$, and results of \cite{BDS23} which restrict to the even $d$ case. We also confirm the phase coexistence prediction of \cite{BDS23}, asserting that the Potts local weak limit is a genuine mixture of the free and wired states in a generic setting. We further characterize the subsequential local weak limits of random cluster measures on such graph sequences, for any cluster parameter $q>2$ (not necessarily integer)."

By adapting the normal form approach to the modulated setting, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of solutions to the modulated KdV in $L^2(\mathbb T)$ if a modulation is sufficiently irregular. For example, this result implies that if the modulation is given by a sample path of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $0 < H < \frac 25$, the modulated KdV on the circle is unconditionally well-posed in $L^2(\mathbb T)$. Our normal form approach provides the construction of solutions to the modulated KdV (and the associated nonlinear Young integral) {\it without} assuming any positive regularity in time. As an interesting byproduct of our normal form approach, we extend the construction of the nonlinear Young integral to a much larger class of functions, and obtain an improved Euler approximation scheme as compared to the classical sewing lemma approach. We also establish analogous sharp unconditional uniqueness results for the modulated Benjamin-Ono equation and the modulated derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) with a quadratic nonlinearity. In the appendix, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of the cubic modulated NLS on the circle in $H^{\frac 16}(\mathbb T)$."

The control variable is the Robin coefficient on the boundary. First-order necessary and second-order sufficient optimality conditions are derived. A sequential quadratic programming algorithm is then proposed to compute local solutions. Starting the iterations from an initial point in an $L^2$-neighborhood of the local solution we prove stability and quadratic convergence of the algorithm in $L^p$ ($p < \infty$) and $L^\infty$ assuming that the local solution satisfies a no-gap second-order sufficient optimality condition and a strict complementarity condition.

In this paper we study the characteristic cycle $\textup{CC}(γ\cdot \ind_U)$ of the restriction of a constructible function $γ$ on $U$. We globalise Ginzburg's local sharp construction and introduce the log transversality condition, which is a new transversality condition about the relative position of $γ$ and $D$. We prove that the log transversality condition is satisfied if either $D$ is normal crossing and $γ$ is arbitrary, or $D$ is holonomic strongly Euler homogheneous and $γ$ is non-characteristic. Under the log transversality assumption we establish a logarithmic pullback formula for $\textup{CC}(γ\cdot \ind_U)$. Mixing Ginzburg's sharp construction with the logarithmic pullback, we obtain a double restriction formula for the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class $c_*(γ\cdot \ind_{D\cup V})$ where $V$ is any reduced hypersurface in $M$. Applications of our results include the non-negativity of Euler characteristics of effective constructible functions, and CSM classes of hypersurfaces in the open manifold $\mathbb{P}^n\setminus D$ when $D$ is a linear free divisor or a free hyperplane arrangement."

This hybrid LG model comprises a non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold $X_{CY}$, and a holomorphic function $W$, defined on $X_{CY}$, such that the critical locus of $W$ is isomorphic to $V$. We construct a complete Kähler metric $\mathfrak{g}$ and a bounded Calabi-Yau volume form $Ω$ on $X_{CY}$ such that $(X_{CY},\mathfrak{g}, Ω)$ is a bounded Calabi-Yau geometry and the function $W$ is strongly elliptic; this enables us to apply the $L^2$-Hodge theory of Li-Wen [18] to $(X_{CY},\mathfrak{g}, Ω)$ and $W$, which leads to a Frobenius manifold structure on the twisted de Rham cohomology associated to $(X_{CY},W)$.

In addition, we study the diffusion wave property came from the wave equation with strong damping for the solution with the initial data belonging to the critical Besov space.

A full characterization of graphs $H$ for which $H$-induced-saturated graphs exist remains elusive. Even the case where $H$ is a path -- now settled by the collective results of Martin and Smith, Bonamy et al., and Dvoŕǎk -- was already quite challenging.
  What if $H$ is a cycle? The complete answer for odd cycles was given by Behren et al., leaving the case of even cycles (except for the $4$-cycle) wide open. Our main result is the first step toward closing this gap: We prove that for every even cycle $H$, there is a graph $G$ with at least one edge such that $G$ is $H$-free but removing any edge from $G$ creates an induced copy of $H$ (in fact, we construct $H$-induced-saturated graphs for every even cycle $H$ on at most 10 vertices)."

We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor."
2505.24094,A generating set of Reidemeister moves of oriented virtual knots,['math.GT'],['Danish Ali'],"In oriented knot theory, verifying a quantity is an invariant involves checking its invariance under all oriented Reidemeister moves, a process that can be intricate and time-consuming. A generating set of oriented moves simplifies this by requiring verification for only a minimal subset from which all other moves can be derived. While generating sets for classical oriented Reidemeister moves are well-established, their virtual counterparts are less explored. In this study, we enumerate the oriented virtual Reidemeister moves, identifying seventeen distinct moves after accounting for redundancies due to rotational and combinatorial symmetries. We prove that a four-element subset serves as a generating set for these moves. This result offers a streamlined approach to verifying invariants of oriented virtual knots and lays the groundwork for future advancements in virtual knot theory, particularly in the study of invariants and their computational properties."

Given an $m$-element set $S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$, is there guaranteed to be a $[k,t]$-flat, that is, a $k$-dimensional affine subspace of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ containing exactly $t$ points of $S$? Such problems can be viewed as generalizations of the cap set problem over the binary field. They conjectured that for every fixed pair $(k,t)$ with $k\ge 1$ and $0\le t\le 2^k$, the density of values $m\in \{0,...,2^n\}$ for which a $[k,t]$-flat is guaranteed tends to $1$.
  In this paper, motivated by the study of the smallest open case $(k,t)=(3,1)$, we present explicit constructions of sets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ avoiding $[k,1]$-flats for exponentially many sizes. These sets rely on carefully constructed binary linear codes, whose weight enumerators determine the size of the construction."

This general class includes a popular approach that uses a finite element approximation of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) associated with Matérn GP. We explored another scalable alternative popularly used in the computer emulation literature where the basis coefficients at a lattice are drawn from a Gaussian process with an inverse-Gamma bandwidth. For both approaches, we study concentration rates of the posterior distribution. We demonstrated that the SPDE associated approach with a fixed smoothness parameter leads to a suboptimal rate despite how the number of basis functions and bandwidth are chosen when the underlying true function is sufficiently smooth. On the flip side, we showed that the later approach is rate-optimal adaptively over all smoothness levels of the underlying true function if an appropriate prior is placed on the number of basis functions. Efficient computational strategies are developed and numerics are provided to illustrate the theoretical results."

Various properties of these rings are studied and as applications, we show that $(\varphi,Γ_{\mathfrak{F},K})$-modules over these rings bridge $(\varphi,Γ)$-modules and $(\varphi,τ)$-modules over imperfect period rings in both classical and cohomological sense, which answers a question of Caruso. Finally, we construct the $ψ$ operator for false Tate curve extension and discuss the possibility to calculate Iwasawa cohomology for this extension via $(\varphi,Γ_{\mathfrak{F},K})$-modules over these rings."

Although this scheme enforced solution positivity using cell averages as reference values, it lacked a theoretical guarantee for the positivity of those cell averages. In this study, we develop a novel arbitrary high-order DDG method with rigorously proven positivity-preserving properties. Specifically, the positivity of the cell averages is ensured through a modified numerical flux in combination with forward Euler time discretization. To achieve point-wise positivity of ion concentrations, we introduce a hybrid algorithm that integrates a positivity-preserving limiter. The proposed method is further extended to higher-dimensional problems with rectangular meshes. Numerical results confirm the scheme's high-order accuracy, guaranteed positivity preservation, and consistent discrete energy dissipation."

Conjugate gradients (\cg) applied to the normal equations with an appropriate stopping rule and \cg applied to the system solving for a Tikhonov-regularized solution (\cgt) $(A^\ast A + c I_{\mathcal{X}}) x^{(δ,c)} = A^\ast y^δ$ are closely related regularization methods that build iterates from the same family of Krylov subspaces.
  In this work, we show that the \cgt iterate can be expressed as $x^{(δ,c)}_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} γ^{(m)}_i(c) z_i^{(m)}v_i$, where $\braces{γ_i^{(m)}(c)}_{i=1}^m$ are functions of the Tikhonov parameter and $x^{(δ)}_m = \sum_{i=1}^{m} z_i^{(m)}v_i$ is the $m$-th \cg iterate. We call these functions \emph{Lanczos filters}, and they can be shown to have decay properties as $c\rightarrow\infty$ with the speed of decay increasing with $i$. This has the effect of filtering out the contribution of the later terms of the \cg iterate. The filters can be constructed using quantities defined via recursions at each iteration.
  We demonstrate with numerical experiments that good parameter choices correspond to appropriate damping of the Lanczos vectors. The filtration approach also provides a platform for further development of parameter choice rules, and similar representations may hold for other hybrid iterative schemes."

In the first one, mostly classical, we recall a priori estimates, from the paper by the third named author, for solutions to suitable constructed Galerkin approximations and we use the Jakubowski-Skorokhod Theorem to find a sequence of processes on a new probability space convergent point-wise to a limit process. In the second one, we show that the limit process is a weak martingale solution to the SNSEs by using an approach of Kallianpur and Xiong. The core of this method consists of a proof that a certain natural process on the new probability space is a purely discontinuous martingale and then to use a suitable representation theorem. In this way we propose a method of proving solutions to stochastic PDEs which is different from the method used recently by the first and fourth named author in their joint paper with E.\ Hausenblas, see \cite{Brz+Haus+Raza_2018_reaction_diffusion}."

In the same year Mostowski unveiled a contrasting result: GB provides a truth-definition for ZF-formulae. Here we first give an expository account of Mostowski's construction and surrounding results, and then we show that the construction bridges the domain of Tarski-style truth theories over PA with certain subsystems of second order arithmetic."

In this paper, we explore methods for constructing non-trivial cellular sheaves on spaces that include structures of dimension greater than one. This extends the focus from 0- or 1-dimensional components, such as vertices and edges, to elements like triangles, tetrahedra, and other higher-dimensional simplices within a simplicial complex. We develop a unified framework that incorporates both geometric and algebraic approaches to modeling such complex systems using cellular sheaf theory. Motivated by the geometric and physical insights from anisotropic network models (ANM), we first introduce constructions that define sheaf structures whose 0-th sheaf Laplacians recover classical ANM Hessian matrices. The higher-dimensional sheaf Laplacians in this setting encode additional patterns of multi-way interactions. In parallel, we propose an algebraic framework based on commutative algebra and ringed spaces, where sheaves of ideals and modules are used to define sheaf structures in a combinatorial and algebraically grounded manner. These two perspectives -- the geometric-physical and the algebraic -- offer complementary strengths and together provide a versatile framework for encoding structural relationships and analyzing multi-scale data over simplicial complexes."

We derive the normal form of the unfolding, when the ratio $ω_1/ω_2$ is irrational and study the truncated normal form of the fourth order. This truncated normal form is the same under the absence of strong resonances. The normal form has two quadratic integrals generating a symplectic periodic action of the abelian group $T^2.$ After reduction by means of these integrals we come to the reduced system with two degrees of freedom that is proven to be non-integrable for almost all values of its coefficients. Integrable such systems are also possible at some special values of coefficients, related examples are presented. Some investigations of this truncated system are presented along with its bifurcations when varying small detuning parameters. As an example of a system where this bifurcation is met, the system derived in \cite{KuLe} is investigated. Its homoclinic solutions are examined numerically when the system parameters correspond to a main equilibrium of the twofold saddle-focus type."

We call a pancake decomposition obtained from our algorithm a greedy pancake decomposition. We also prove that greedy pancake decompositions of weakly outer Lipschitz equivalent snakes (or circular snakes) are weakly equivalent, in the sense that there is a weakly outer bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism between the surfaces mapping each greedy pancake to a greedy pancake. This implies that such minimal decompositions are also canonical up to weakly outer bi-Lipschitz equivalence."

The process $L$ is renormalized as $X^\varepsilon(t) = \varepsilon L(r_\varepsilon t)$, $t\in [0, T]$, for a scaling parameter $r_\varepsilon= o(\varepsilon^{-1})$, as $\varepsilon \to 0$. We study the behavior of the bridge $Y^{\varepsilon, x}$ of the renormalized process $X^\varepsilon$ conditioned on the event $X^\varepsilon(T) = x$ for a given end point $x\neq 0$ and end time $T>0$ in the regime of small $\varepsilon$. Our main result is a sample path large deviations principle (LDP) for $Y^{\varepsilon, x}$ with a specific speed function $S(\varepsilon)$ and an entropy-type rate function $I_{x}$ on the Skorokhod space in the limit $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0+$. We show that the asymptotic energy minimizing path of $Y^{\varepsilon, x}$ is the linear parametrization of the straight line between $0$ and $x$, while all paths leaving this set are exponentially negligible. We also infer a LDP for the asymptotic number of jumps and establish asymptotic normality of the jump increments of $Y^{\varepsilon, x}$. Since on these short time scales $r_\varepsilon = o(\varepsilon^{-1})$) direct LDP methods cannot be adapted we use an alternative direct approach based on convolution density estimates of the marginals $X^{\varepsilon}(t)$, $t\in [0, T]$,for which we solve a specific nonlinear functional equation."

Moreover, the associated transfer operator $\mathcal{L}_{f , tφ}$, acting on the space of Hölder continuous functions, has the spectral gap property for $t \in \mathbb{R}$. For dynamics that are topologically conjugate to an expanding map, a full understanding has yet to be achieved. On the one hand, by \cite{KQW21,KQ22}, for such maps and continuous potentials, the associated topological pressure function can behave wildly. On the other hand, by \cite{BF23}, for transitive local diffeomorphisms on the circle and a large class of Hölder continuous potentials, the phase transition does not occur, and the associated transfer operator has the spectral gap property for all parameters $t \in \mathbb{R}$. As a first approach to understanding what happens in high dimensions, in this paper, we study positively expansive local diffeomorphisms. In particular, we show that the associated transfer operator has the spectral gap property for a large class of regular potentials. Moreover, for a class of intermittent skew-products and a large class of regular potentials, we obtain phase transition results analogous to \cite{BF23}."

The core innovation involves using hierarchical prior-normalizing transport maps (TMs), which are deterministic couplings that transform the sparsity-promoting SBL prior into a standard normal one. We analytically derive these prior-normalizing TMs by leveraging the product-like form of SBL priors and Knothe--Rosenblatt (KR) rearrangements. These transform the complex target posterior into a simpler reference distribution equipped with a standard normal prior that can be sampled more efficiently. Specifically, one can leverage the standard normal prior by using more efficient, structure-exploiting samplers. Our numerical experiments on various inverse problems -- including signal deblurring, inverting the non-linear inviscid Burgers equation, and recovering an impulse image -- demonstrate significant performance improvements for standard MCMC techniques."

Our result answers the question of whether a positive proportion of Galois octic extensions of $\mathbb Q$ have non-abelian Galois group in the negative. We further demonstrate that the constant of proportionality satisfies the Malle--Bhargava principle of being a product of local masses, despite the fact that this principle does {\em not} hold for discriminants of quartic $D_4$-fields.
  This is the first instance of asymptotics being recovered for a non-concentrated family of number fields of Galois group neither abelian nor symmetric. Previously, this was only known for abelian fields, degree-$n$ $S_n$-fields for $n=3,4,5$, and degree-$6$ $S_3$-fields."

By expanding the score function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent sample generation.

We demonstrate that the sequence of solutions converges locally, in the Sobolev norm, to a solution of the corresponding cross-sectional problem. Moreover, we establish a convergence rate. As part of our analysis, we extend existing convergence results for the case $p\geq 2$, which previously lacked explicit convergence rates, to the range $1<p<2$. We additionally address solutions with finite Dirichlet boundary data within a unified framework and exhibit that this rate of convergence is independent of the boundary data."
2505.23592,A Modern Theory of Cross-Validation through the Lens of Stability,['math.ST'],['Jing Lei'],"Modern data analysis and statistical learning are marked by complex data structures and black-box algorithms. Data complexity stems from technologies such as imaging, remote sensing, wearable devices, and genomic sequencing. At the same time, black-box models, especially deep neural networks, have achieved impressive results. This combination raises new challenges for uncertainty quantification and statistical inference, which we refer to as ``black-box inference.''
  Black-box inference is difficult due to the lack of traditional modeling assumptions and the opaque behavior of modern estimators. These factors make it hard to characterize the distribution of estimation errors. A popular solution is post-hoc randomization, which, under mild assumptions such as exchangeability, can yield valid uncertainty quantification. Such methods range from classical techniques like permutation tests, the jackknife, and the bootstrap to more recent innovations like conformal inference. These approaches typically require little knowledge of data distributions or the internal workings of estimators. Many rely on the idea that estimators behave similarly under small perturbations of the data -- a concept formalized as stability. Over time, stability has become a key principle in data science, influencing research on generalization error, privacy, and adaptive inference.
  This article investigates cross-validation (CV) -- a widely used resampling method -- through the lens of stability. We first review recent theoretical results on CV for estimating generalization error and model selection under stability assumptions. We then examine uncertainty quantification for CV-based risk estimates. Together, these insights yield new theory and tools, which we apply to topics including model selection, selective inference, and conformal prediction."

A classical theorem in differential geometry states that the Gauss curvature function $K : M \to \mathbb{R}$ vanishes everywhere if and only if the surface is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane. We give an asymptotically sharp quantitative version of this theorem with respect to an isothermal coordinate chart. Roughly speaking, we show that if $B$ is a Riemannian disc of radius $δ> 0$ with $δ^{2}\sup_{B}|K| < \varepsilon$ for some $0 < \varepsilon < 1$, then there is an isothermal coordinate map from $B$ onto an Euclidean disc of radius $δ$ which is bi-Lipschitz with constant $\exp(4 \varepsilon)$."
2505.23582,$S^{\top\!}S$-SVD and the Nearest Sketched Orthogonal Matrix,['math.NA'],"['Davide Palitta', 'Valeria Simoncini']","Sketching techniques have gained popularity in numerical linear algebra to accelerate the solution of least squares problems. The so-called $\varepsilon$-subspace embedding property of a sketching matrix $S$ has been largely used to characterize the problem residual norm, since the procedure is no longer optimal in terms of the (classical) Frobenius or Euclidean norm. By building on available results on the SVD of the sketched matrix $SA$ derived by Gilbert, Park, and Wakin (Proc. of SPARS-2013), a novel decomposition of $A$, the $S^{\top\!} S$-SVD, is proposed, which is exact with high probability, and in which the left singular vectors are orthonormal with respect to a (semi-)norm defined by the sketching matrix $S$. The new decomposition is less expensive to compute, while preserving the singular values with probabilistic confidence. The $S^{\top\!} S$-SVD appears to be the right tool to analyze the quality of several sketching techniques in the literature, for which examples are reported. For instance, it is possible to simply bound the distance from (standard) orthogonality of sketched orthogonal matrices in state-of-the-art randomized QR algorithms. As an application, the classical problem of the nearest orthogonal matrix is generalized to the new $S^{\top\!} S$-orthogonality, and the $S^{\top\!} S$-SVD is used to solve it. Probabilistic bounds on the quality of the solution are also derived."

Recent works have demonstrated that using a time-varying sequence of matrices that achieve finite-time consensus can improve the communication and iteration complexity of decentralized optimization algorithms based on gradient tracking. In practice, a sequence of matrices satisfying the exact finite-time consensus property may not be available due to imperfect knowledge of the network topology, a limit on the length of the sequence, or numerical instabilities. In this work, we quantify the impact of approximate finite-time consensus sequences on the convergence of a gradient-tracking based decentralized optimization algorithm, clarifying the interplay between accuracy and length of the sequence as well as typical problem parameters such as smoothness and gradient noise."

In this class, we examine clouds - classes of spaces situated at finite Gromov-Hausdorff distances from a reference space. We prove that all clouds are proper classes. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance is defined for clouds similarly with the case of that for metric spaces. A multiplicative group of transformations of clouds is defined which is called stabilizer. We show that under certain restrictions the distance between the cloud of bounded metric spaces and a cloud with a nontrivial stabilizer is finite.

2505.23560,Ambulance Allocation for Patient-Centered Care,['math.OC'],"['Eric G. Stratman', 'Justin J. Boutilier', 'Laura A. Albert']","Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the United States and similar systems typically utilize a single treatment pathway, transporting all patients to emergency departments (EDs), regardless of their actual care needs or preferences. Recent policy reforms have sought to introduce alternative treatment pathways to divert lower acuity patients from the ED, but operationalizing these options has proven difficult. This paper proposes a patient-centered EMS (PC-EMS) ambulance allocation model that supports multiple care pathways by aligning EMS responses with individual patient needs. We develop a two-stage mixed-integer optimization framework that incorporates multiple dispatch and secondary assignment strategies which enable dynamic resource deployment. The model maximizes appropriate ED diversions while maintaining ambulance availability using a queueing-based availability constraint. We leverage national EMS data and machine learning to estimate dispatcher accuracy and diversion potential. Simulations across diverse geographic regions suggest that agencies can achieve up to 80% of possible ED diversions by equipping only 15 to 25% of their fleet with diversion capable units. Adaptive dispatch strategies improve diversion rates by 3.4 to 8.6 times compared to conventional single unit dispatch. These results provide actionable guidance for PC-EMS implementation by quantifying the trade off between equipment investment and operational coordination. Using the allocation model, agencies can strategically choose between upgrading fewer units with advanced dispatching protocols versus larger fleet investments with simpler operations. This approach offers flexible pathways suited to different organizational capabilities and implementation readiness."

Our first contribution is to precisely characterize the selection probabilities representable under this model and show that verifying the consistency of any given aggregated selection dataset reduces to solving a polynomial-sized linear program. Building on this characterization, we develop a nonparametric method for counterfactual prediction. When data is inconsistent with the model, finding a best-fitting approximation for prediction reduces to solving a compact mixed-integer convex program. Numerical experiments based on synthetic data demonstrate the method's flexibility, predictive accuracy, and strong representational power even under model misspecification."

Global well-posedness is established for the resulting parabolic free boundary value problem in strong form in Sobolev spaces and for a quasi-stationary approximation in spaces of classical regularity. The general existence results are complemented by results about the qualitative properties of solutions including the existence, in general, and, additionally, the uniqueness and stability of non-trivial equilibria, in a special case."
2505.23541,Upper and lower bounds for local Lipschitz stability of Bayesian posteriors,['math.ST'],"['Nada Cvetković', 'Han Cheng Lie']","The work of Sprungk (Inverse Problems, 2020) established the local Lipschitz continuity of the misfit-to-posterior and prior-to-posterior maps with respect to the Kullback--Leibler divergence and the total variation, Hellinger, and 1-Wasserstein metrics, by proving certain upper bounds. The upper bounds were also used to show that if a posterior measure is more concentrated, then it can be more sensitive to perturbations in the misfit or prior. We prove upper bounds and lower bounds that emphasise the importance of the evidence. The lower bounds show that the sensitivity of posteriors to perturbations in the misfit or the prior not only can increase, but in general will increase as the posterior measure becomes more concentrated, i.e. as the evidence decreases to zero. Using the explicit dependence of our bounds on the evidence, we identify sufficient conditions for the misfit-to-posterior and prior-to-posterior maps to be locally bi-Lipschitz continuous."

The shell is modelled by linear thermoelasticity equations, and encompasses a time-dependent domain which is filled with a fluid described by full compressible (non-resistive) magnetohydrodynamic equations. The magnetohydrodynamic flow and the shell are fully coupled, resulting in a fluid-structure interaction problem that involves heat exchange. We establish the existence of weak solutions through domain extension, operator splitting, decoupling, penalization of the interface condition, and appropriate limit passages."

2505.23517,Inexact JKO and proximal-gradient algorithms in the Wasserstein space,['math.OC'],"['Simone Di Marino', 'Emanuele Naldi', 'Silvia Villa']","This paper studies the convergence properties of the inexact Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme and proximal-gradient algorithm in the context of Wasserstein spaces. The JKO scheme, a widely-used method for approximating solutions to gradient flows in Wasserstein spaces, typically assumes exact solutions to iterative minimization problems. However, practical applications often require approximate solutions due to computational limitations. This work focuses on the convergence of the scheme to minimizers for the underlying functional and addresses these challenges by analyzing two types of inexactness: errors in Wasserstein distance and errors in energy functional evaluations. The paper provides rigorous convergence guarantees under controlled error conditions, demonstrating that weak convergence can still be achieved with inexact steps. The analysis is further extended to proximal-gradient algorithms, showing that convergence is preserved under inexact evaluations."

Due to the complexity of new problems related to the size of datasets, efficient approaches are obligatory. In optimization theory, the Heavy Ball and Nesterov methods use \textit{momentum} in their updates of model weights. On the other hand, the minimization problems considered may be poorly conditioned, which affects the applicability and effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques. One solution to this issue is \textit{preconditioning}, which has already been investigated in approaches such as \textsc{AdaGrad}, \textsc{RMSProp}, \textsc{Adam} and others. Despite this, momentum acceleration and preconditioning have not been fully explored together. Therefore, we propose the Preconditioned Heavy Ball (\textsc{PHB}) and Preconditioned Nesterov method (\textsc{PN}) with theoretical guarantees of convergence under \textit{unified} assumption on the scaling matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical experiments that demonstrate superior performance compared to the unscaled techniques in terms of iteration and oracle complexities."

If we equip this data with a homomorphism $θ:Γ\to\text{Aut}(G)$ and a 2-cocycle $c:Γ\timesΓ\to Z$, there is a notion of $(θ,c)$-twisted $Γ$-equivariant $G$-bundle over $X$. The aim of this paper is to construct a coarse moduli space of isomorphism classes of polystable $(θ,c)$-twisted equivariant $G$-bundles over $X$, according to the definition of polystability given by García-Prada--Gothen--Mundet i Riera. This generalizes the well-known construction of the moduli space of $G$-bundles given by Ramanathan. It also gives, in particular, a GIT construction of the moduli space of $Γ$-equivariant $G$-bundles, and the moduli space of $\hat G$-bundles for $\hat G$ non-connected by our joint work with García-Prada, Gothen and Mundet i Riera -- complementing the construction of a projective good moduli space for the moduli stack of $\hat G$-bundles given by Olsson--Reppen--Tajakka."

Under a Dini-type assumption on the mean oscillation of the matrix $A$, we establish the following results:
  1) A rectifiability criterion for $μ$ in terms of $T_μ$. Under quantitative geometric and analytic assumptions within a ball $B$ -- including an upper $n$-growth condition on $μ$ in $B$, a thin boundary condition, a scale-invariant decay condition expressed via a weighted sum of densities over dyadic dilations of $B$, and $L^2$ boundedness of the gradient of $T_μ$ -- we show the following: if the support of $μ$ lies very close to an $n$-plane in $B$, and $T_μ1$ is nearly constant on $B$ in the $L^2$ sense, then there exists a uniformly $n$-rectifiable set $Γ$ such that $μ(B \cap Γ) \gtrsim μ(B)$.
  2) A $Tb$ theorem for suppressed $T_μ$, which extends a well-known theorem of Nazarov, Treil, and Volberg, and holds also for a broader class of singular integral operators.
  These results make it possible to prove both qualitative and quantitative one- and two-phase free boundary problems for elliptic measure, formulated in terms of (uniform) rectifiability, in bounded Wiener-regular domains."

Whereas existing methods apply to eigenfunction problems where the eigenvalue is known (e.g., integrals with respect to a Gibbs measure, which can be interpreted as corresponding to eigenvalue zero), here the focus is on problems where the eigenvalue is not known a priori. To obtain an appropriate particle exchange rule we must consider a pair of processes, with one evolving forward in time and the other backward. Applications to eigenfunction problems corresponding to quasistationary distributions and ergodic stochastic control are discussed."
2505.23441,Mean Field Control with Poissonian Common Noise: A Pathwise Compactification Approach,"['math.OC', 'math.PR']","['Lijun Bo', 'Jingfei Wang', 'Xiaoli Wei', 'Xiang Yu']","This paper contributes to the compactification approach to tackle mean-field control (MFC) problems with Poissonian common noise. To overcome the lack of compactness and continuity issues due to common noise, we exploit the point process representation of the Poisson random measure with finite intensity and propose a pathwise formulation by freezing a sample path of the common noise. We first study a pathwise relaxed control problem in an auxiliary setup without common noise but with finite deterministic jumping times over the finite horizon. By employing the compactification argument for the pathwise relaxed control problem with Skorokhod topology, we establish the existence of optimal controls in the pathwise formulation. To address the original problem, the main challenge is to close the gap between the problem in the original model with common noise and the pathwise formulation. With the help of concatenation techniques over the sequence of deterministic jumping times, we develop a new tool, also interpreted as the superposition principle in the pathwise formulation, to draw a relationship between the pathwise relaxed control problem and the pathwise measure-valued control problem associated to Fokker-Planck equation. As a result, we can bridge the desired equivalence among different problem formulations. We also extend the methodology to solve mean-field games with Poissonian common noise, confirming the existence of a strong mean field equilibrium."

In particular, we prove the comparison holds for metrics close to strictly stable positive Einstein metric with $l<\frac{n}{2}$. As for negative Einstein metrics, we prove a similar comparison result provided certain assumptions on sectional curvature holds for the manifold."
2505.23430,Locating Extremal Periodic Orbits for the Planar Circular Restricted Three Body Problem using Polynomial Sum-of-Squares Optimization,"['math.DS', 'math-ph']","['Vinay Sharma', 'Sergei I Chernyshenko']","With an increasing interest in the design of long and complex space missions, the search for orbits that require the least amount of fuel is of fundamental interest. This paper develops existing computational models for locating Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization technique and proposes a numerical framework to converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP) in astrodynamics. This is done by developing the polynomial SOS optimization technique with extension to systems with non-polynomial and Hamiltonian dynamics. First, we demonstrate and exploit the dependency of convergence of tight bounds on an observable of interest with varying scaling factors for large polynomial degrees. SOS optimization is then used to compute nonnegative polynomials, the minimization sublevel sets of which, approximately localise parts of the corresponding UPO. Improvements in current non-linear optimization techniques are suggested to compute a large number of points inside the relevant sublevel sets. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations with existing algorithms. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs is that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest which is a function of state variables. For the PCR3BP this means that such orbits in space can be traversed indefinitely in time without continuous fuel expenditure. As practical applications to space mission designs, we converge UPOs that minimise transmitted power required by satellites for the Earth-Moon system in a communication relay problem by minimizing the infinite-time average of sum of squares of distances of a satellite from Earth and the Moon."

Classical DMRG, however, is based on sequential minimization, which raises challenges in its implementation on parallel computing architectures. To overcome this, we propose a novel additive two-level DMRG algorithm that combines independent, local minimization steps with a global update step using a subsequent coarse-space minimization. Our proposed algorithm, which is directly inspired by additive Schwarz methods from the domain decomposition literature, is particularly amenable to implementation on parallel, distributed architectures since both the local minimization steps and the construction of the coarse-space can be performed in parallel. Numerical experiments on strongly correlated molecular systems demonstrate that the method achieves competitive convergence rates while achieving significant parallel speedups."

In this paper we construct explicit models for the homotopy limits of diagrams of microlocal sheaf categories which arise from Weinstein surfaces with arboreal skeleta. This is done by characterizing all relevant Reedy model structures on the categories of diagrams that we care about. We prove invariance using a complete set of moves for Weinstein homotopies in this setting. Finally we give combinatorial presentations of the invariant for all topological surfaces.

One of the main aims of the paper is to extend the study of such a connection to the broader case of overdetermined problems for Hessian operators and constant higher order mean curvature boundaries. Our analysis will not only provide new proofs of the higher order SBT (originally established by Alexandrov) and of the symmetry for overdetermined Serrin-type problems for Hessian equations (originally established by Brandolini, Nitsch, Salani, and Trombetti), but also bring several benefits, including new interesting symmetry results and quantitative stability estimates.
  In fact, leveraging the analysis performed in the classical case (i.e., with classical mean curvature and classical Laplacian) by Magnanini and Poggesi in a series of papers, we will extend their approach to the higher order setting (i.e., with $k$-order mean curvature and $k$-Hessian operator, for $k \ge 1$) achieving various quantitative estimates of closeness to the symmetric configuration. Finally, leveraging the quantitative analysis in presence of bubbling phenomena performed in arXiv:2405.06376, we also provide a quantitative stability result of closeness of almost constant $k$-mean curvature boundaries to a set given by the union of a finite number of disjoint balls of equal radii. In passing, we will also provide two alternative proofs of the result established by Brandolini, Nitsch, Salani, and Trombetti, one of which provides the extension to Hessian operators of the approach famously pioneered by Weinberger for the classical Laplacian."

The proofs of the main theorems involve showing that the defining equations of the Coulomb branch algebras reflect the properness of moduli spaces required for defining shift operators.
  As a main application, we give a very general definition of shift operators, and show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $f \colon X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH^\bullet_G(X)$ defines a family of closed Lagrangians in the Coulomb branch $\mathrm{Spec}\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}$, yielding a transformation of 3d branes in 3d mirror symmetry.

The novelty of our result is that one can take any variable-exponent $L^{p(\cdot)}(w)$, not just $L^p(w)$, as a starting point of extrapolation. An application of our extrapolation to commutators $[b,T]$ of pointwise multipliers and singular integrals allows us to complete a set of implications, showing that $b\in CMO(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is not only sufficient (as known from Lorist-Nieraeth) but also necessary for the compactness of $[b,T]$ on any fixed $L^{p(\cdot)}(w)$."

Furthermore, for linear observation models with design matrices satisfying restricted eigenvalue conditions, we derive statistical estimation error bounds between the PMM-generated iterates (including their limit points) and the ground truth solution. These bounds not only rigorously quantify the approximation accuracy of the algorithm but also extend previous results on element-wise sparse composite optimization from reference [57]. To efficiently implement the PMM framework, we develop a proximal dual semismooth Newton method for solving critical subproblems.

We also show that the oriented matroids (OMs) constituting the cells of COMs arising from mediangle graphs are exactly the simplicial OMs.

This phenomenon has been studied earlier in the regular case, which in this context is in terms of the summability of the angles of the corners generated. Our goal here is to investigate the lower regularity case, using further the Hasimoto approach that allows to use the 1D cubic nonlinear Schrödinger to study the binormal flow. We first obtain a deterministic result by proving an existence result for general binormal flow solutions at low regularity. Then we obtain improved results on the above class of solutions by a suitable randomization of the curvature and torsion of the vortex filament. To do so, we prove a scattering result for a quasi-invariance measure associated with a suitable 1D cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation that we consider of independent interest. An interesting feature of this result is that we are able to identify a limit measure, which is usually not possible when working on quasi-invariant Gaussian measures for Hamiltonian PDEs on bounded domains."
2505.23273,"Robust Sparse Phase Retrieval: Statistical Guarantee, Optimality Theory and Convergent Algorithm",['math.OC'],"['Jun Fan', 'Ailing Yan', 'Xianchao Xiu', 'Wanquan Liu']","Phase retrieval (PR) is a popular research topic in signal processing and machine learning. However, its performance degrades significantly when the measurements are corrupted by noise or outliers. To address this limitation, we propose a novel robust sparse PR method that covers both real- and complex-valued cases. The core is to leverage the Huber function to measure the loss and adopt the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm regularization to realize feature selection, thereby improving the robustness of PR. In theory, we establish statistical guarantees for such robustness and derive necessary optimality conditions for global minimizers. Particularly, for the complex-valued case, we provide a fixed point inclusion property inspired by Wirtinger derivatives. Furthermore, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm by integrating the gradient descent method into a majorization-minimization (MM) framework. It is rigorously proved that the whole generated sequence is convergent and also has a linear convergence rate under mild conditions, which has not been investigated before. Numerical examples under different types of noise validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method."

We show that every element of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathcal{I})$ is a Choquet average of certain ultrafilter limit functionals. Also, we prove that the diameter of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathcal{I})$ is $2$ if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is not maximal, and that the latter claim can be considerably strengthened if $\mathcal{I}$ is meager. Lastly, we provide several applications: for instance, recovering a result of Freedman in [Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 13 (1981), 224--228], we show that the family of bounded sequences for which all functionals in $\mathrm{SL}(\mathcal{I})$ assign the same value coincides with the closed vector space of bounded $\mathcal{I}$-convergent sequences."

Inexpensive implementation and evaluation, polytopal meshes, iterative linearization and algebraic solvers, and applications to complex porous media flows",['math.NA'],"['Martin Vohralík', 'Soleiman Yousef']","A posteriori estimates give bounds on the error between the unknown solution of a partial differential equation and its numerical approximation. We present here the methodology based on H1-conforming potential and H(div)-conforming equilibrated flux reconstructions, where the error bounds are guaranteed and fully computable. We consider any lowest-order locally conservative method of the finite volume type and treat general polytopal meshes. We start by a pure diffusion problem and first address the discretization error. We then progressively pass to more complicated model problems, up to complex multiphase multicomponent flow in porous media, and also take into account the errors arising in iterative linearization of nonlinear problems and in algebraic resolution of systems of linear algebraic equations. We focus on the ease of implementation and evaluation of the estimates. In particular, the evaluation of our estimates is explicit and inexpensive, since it merely consists in some local matrix-vector multiplications. Here, on each mesh element, the matrices are either directly inherited from the given numerical method, or easily constructed from the element geometry, while the vectors are the algebraic unknowns of the flux and potential approximations on the given element. Our mtehodology leads to an easy-to-implement and fast-to-run adaptive algorithm with guaranteed overall precision, adaptive stopping criteria for nonlinear and linear solvers, and adaptive space and time mesh refinements and derefinements. Progressively along the theoretical exposition, numerical experiments on academic benchmarks as well as on real-life problems in two and three space dimensions illustrate the performance of the derived methodology.

Given partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a ``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are very sparse and disconnected."

The key idea is that the convergence of this normalized integral is equivalent to the condition that all non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line. By constructing a singularity-sensitive integrand and removing infinitesimal disks around the poles, we isolate all divergence contributions analytically. The resulting integral model is independent of specific zero locations and provides a purely analytic criterion equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis."

Furnishing with classical no-slip, no-spin and no-flux boundary conditions, in a smooth and bounded three-dimensional domain, we establish the well-posedness of local-in-time strong solutions. Since the model studied is a generalization of the earlier model introduced by Abels, Garcke and Grün for binary Newtonian fluids with unmatched densities, we provide a consistency result between the corresponding strong solutions to both models in terms of a parameter associated to the micro-rotation viscosity."

2505.23218,An application of the hit problem to the algebraic transfer,['math.AT'],['Nguyen Sum'],"Let $P_k$ be the polynomial algebra $\mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k]$ over the field $\mathbb F_2$ with two elements, in $k$ variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_k$, each variable of degree 1. Denote by $GL_k$ the general linear group over $\mathbb F_2$ which regularly acts on $P_k$. The algebra $P_k$ is a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mathcal A$. In 1989, Singer [22] defined the $k$-th homological algebraic transfer, which is a homomorphism $$\varphi_k=(\varphi_k)_m :{\rm Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+m} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2) \to (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P_k)_m^{GL_k}$$ from the homological group of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mbox{Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+m} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2)$ to the subspace $(\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P_k)_m^{GL_k}$ of $\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k$ consisting of all the $GL_k$-invariant classes of degree $m$. In general, the transfer $\varphi_k$ is not a monomorphism and Singer made a conjecture that $\varphi_k$ is an epimorphism for any $k \geqslant 0$. The conjecture is studied by many authors. It is true for $k \leqslant 3$ but unknown for $k \geqslant 4$.
  In this paper, by using the results of the Peterson hit problem for the polynomial algebra in four variables, we prove that Singer's conjecture for the fourth algebraic transfer is true in the families of generic degrees $d_{s,t} = 2^{s+t}+2^s-3$ and $n_{s,t}=2^{s+t}+2^s-2$ with $s,\, t$ positive integers.

The periodic obstacle may include penetrable and impenetrable regions. The TDG method requires the approximation of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator on the periodic cell faces, and relies on plane wave discrete spaces. For polygonal meshes, all linear-system entries can be computed analytically. Using a Rellich identity, we prove a new explicit stability estimate for the Helmholtz solution, which is robust in the small material jump limit."

For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss.

Let $0<q<p<\infty$ and let $ω$ be radial weight on $\mathbb{D}$ which has certain two-sided doubling properties. In this study, we will characterize the measures $μ$ such that the identity mapping $I: A^p_{ω,Ψ} \to L^q_{μ,Φ}$ is bounded and compact, when we assume $Ψ,Φ$ to be essentially monotonic and to satisfy certain doubling properties.

This confirms a set of conjectures formulated in the Ph.D. thesis of Chen, written under the direction of Mark Haiman, and thereby establishes the algebraic framework proposed therein. As a consequence, we deduce that the modified Macdonald polynomials are $k$-Schur positive, thus realizing the original motivation behind the definition of the $k$-Schur functions by Lapointe, Lascoux, and Morse. Our approach builds on our previous work on the algebraic and geometric realization of Catalan symmetric functions, which encompasses both the $k$-Schur functions and the Hall--Littlewood functions."

2505.23152,Provable Benefit of Random Permutations over Uniform Sampling in Stochastic Coordinate Descent,['math.OC'],"['Donghwa Kim', 'Jaewook Lee', 'Chulhee Yun']","We analyze the convergence rates of two popular variants of coordinate descent (CD): random CD (RCD), in which the coordinates are sampled uniformly at random, and random-permutation CD (RPCD), in which random permutations are used to select the update indices. Despite abundant empirical evidence that RPCD outperforms RCD in various tasks, the theoretical gap between the two algorithms' performance has remained elusive. Even for the benign case of positive-definite quadratic functions with permutation-invariant Hessians, previous efforts have failed to demonstrate a provable performance gap between RCD and RPCD. To this end, we present novel results showing that, for a class of quadratics with permutation-invariant structures, the contraction rate upper bound for RPCD is always strictly smaller than the contraction rate lower bound for RCD for every individual problem instance. Furthermore, we conjecture that this function class contains the worst-case examples of RPCD among all positive-definite quadratics. Combined with our RCD lower bound, this conjecture extends our results to the general class of positive-definite quadratic functions."

We derive the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation, verify the supermartingale property of the value function, and characterize the optimal feedback control. Techniques inspired by Lasry, Lions and Alvarez enable us to prove existence and uniqueness within this generalized production planning framework.

The proposed PCCU schemes are constructed via flux globalization strategies adapted to the nonconservative form via a path-conservative finite-volume method. The resulting scheme is well-balanced (WB) in the sense that it is capable of exactly preserving physically relevant steady states including moving-water ones. We validate the proposed scheme on several benchmarks, including smooth solutions, small perturbation of steady states, and dam-break scenarios. These results demonstrate that our flux globalization based WB PCCU schemes provide a reliable framework for computing solutions of shallow water moment models with nonlinear and nonconservative features."
2505.23142,On a question of Abért and Virág,['math.GR'],['Jorge Fariña-Asategui'],"Abért and Virág proved in 2005 that the Hausdorff dimension of a non-trivial normal subgroup of a level-transitive 1-dimensional subgroup of the group of $p$-adic automorphisms $W_p$ is always 1. They further asked whether the same holds replacing 1-dimensional with positive dimensional.
  On the one hand, we provide a negative answer in general by giving counterexamples where the non-trivial normal subgroups are not all 1-dimensional. Furthermore, these counterexamples are pro-$p$ subgroups of $W_p$ with positive Hausdorff dimension in $W_p$ but with non-trivial center, and thus not weakly branch.
  On the other hand, we restrict ourselves to the class of self-similar groups and answer the question of Abért and Virág in the positive in this case. Along the way, we generalize a result of Abért and Virág on the closed subgroups of $W_p$ being perfect in the sense of Hausdorff dimension to closed subgroups of any iterated wreath product $W_H$ and show that self-similar positive-dimensional subgroups of $W_H$ do not satisfy any group law."

We write these as an expected quadratic variation of, or expected inner product between, a random field and the difference of measures. This alternate viewpoint offers important intuition and interesting connections to existing forms. Metric distances leading to convenient finite sample estimates are shown to be induced by fields with dense support, stationary increments, and scale invariance. The main example of this is energy distance. We show that the common generalization preserving continuity is induced by fractional Brownian motion. We induce an alternate generalization with the Gaussian free field, formally extending the Cramér-von Mises distance. Pathwise properties give intuition about practical aspects of each. This is demonstrated through signal to noise ratio studies."

We introduce a Markov kernel that depends on both $β$ and $ α$, and establish new intertwining relations for the $β$-Laguerre processes using this kernel. A key observation is that Jack symmetric polynomials are eigenfunctions of our Markov kernel, which allows us to apply a method established by Ramanan and Shkolnikov. Additionally, as a by-product, we derive an integral formula for multivariate Laguerre polynomials and multivariate hypergeometric functions associated with Jack polynomials."

The induced saturation number sat$^*(n,P)$ is the minimum size of a family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ that does not contain any copy of $P$, but for any $G\in 2^{[n]}\setminus \mathcal{F}$, the family $\mathcal{F}\cup \{G\}$ contains a copy of $P$. We consider sat$^*(n,P)$ for posets $P$ that are formed by pairwise incomparable chains, i.e. $P=\bigoplus_{j=1}^mC_{i_j}$. We make the following two conjectures: (i) sat$^*(n,P)=O(n)$ for all such posets and (ii) sat$^*(n,P)=O(1)$ if not all chains are of the same size. (The second conjecture is known to hold if there is a unique longest among the chains.) We verify these conjectures in some special cases: we prove (i) if all chains are of the same length, we prove (ii) in the first unknown general case: for posets $2C_k+C_1$. Finally, we give an infinite number of examples showing that (ii) is not a necessary condition for sat$^*(n,P)=O(1)$ among posets $P=\bigoplus_{j=1}^mC_{i_j}$: we prove sat$^*(n,(\binom{2t}{t}+1)C_2)=O(1)$ for all $t\ge 1$."

Classifying knots and measuring entanglement is of interest both for advancing knot theory, as well as for analyzing large data that become available through experiments or Artificial Intelligence. In this context, the efficient computation of topological invariants and other metrics of entanglement becomes an urgent issue. The computation of common measures of topological complexity, such as the Jones polynomial, is #P-hard and of exponential time on the number of crossings in a knot(oid) (link(oid)) diagram. In this paper, we introduce the first parallel algorithm for the exact computation of the Jones polynomial for (collections of) both open and closed simple curves in 3-space. This algorithm enables the reduction of the computational time by an exponential factor depending on the number of processors. We demonstrate the advantage of this algorithm by applying it to knots, as well as to systems of linear polymers in a melt obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. The method is general and could be applied to other invariants and measures of complexity."

Theoretical Foundations,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']","['Wenzhi Gao', 'Ya-Chi Chu', 'Yinyu Ye', 'Madeleine Udell']","This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1) trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning."

We first explore the translating solutions corresponding to this boundary value problem. Next, we establish the long-time existence of the flow and prove that it converges to a translating solution. To overcome the difficulty of driving boundary $C^2$ estimates, we employ an orthogonal invariance technique. Using this method, we extend the results of Schnürer-Smoczyk \cite{Schnurer2003} and Schnürer \cite{Schnurer2002} from the second boundary value problem of Gauss curvature flow to $k$-Hessian curvature flow."

2505.23056,Improved Last-Iterate Convergence of Shuffling Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']","['Zijian Liu', 'Zhengyuan Zhou']","We study the convergence of the shuffling gradient method, a popular algorithm employed to minimize the finite-sum function with regularization, in which functions are passed to apply (Proximal) Gradient Descent (GD) one by one whose order is determined by a permutation on the indices of functions. In contrast to its easy implementation and effective performance in practice, the theoretical understanding remains limited. A recent advance by (Liu & Zhou, 2024b) establishes the first last-iterate convergence results under various settings, especially proving the optimal rates for smooth (strongly) convex optimization. However, their bounds for nonsmooth (strongly) convex functions are only as fast as Proximal GD. In this work, we provide the first improved last-iterate analysis for the nonsmooth case demonstrating that the widely used Random Reshuffle ($\textsf{RR}$) and Single Shuffle ($\textsf{SS}$) strategies are both provably faster than Proximal GD, reflecting the benefit of randomness. As an important implication, we give the first (nearly) optimal convergence result for the suffix average under the $\textsf{RR}$ sampling scheme in the general convex case, matching the lower bound shown by (Koren et al., 2022)."

However, the convergence of these classical estimators to the true density slows down in high dimensions. Moreover, they do not define meaningful probability distributions when the intrinsic dimension of data is much smaller than its ambient dimension. We build on previous work on density estimation on manifolds to show that a modified kernel density estimator converges to the true density on $d-$rectifiable sets. As a special case, we consider algebraic varieties and semi-algebraic sets and prove a convergence rate in this setting. We conclude the paper with a numerical experiment illustrating the convergence of this estimator on sparse data."
2505.23002,Deep asymptotic expansion method for solving singularly perturbed time-dependent reaction-advection-diffusion equations,['math.NA'],"['Qiao Zhu', 'Dmitrii Chaikovskii', 'Bangti Jin', 'Ye Zhang']","Physics-informed neural network (PINN) has shown great potential in solving partial differential equations. However, it faces challenges when dealing with problems involving steep gradients. The solutions to singularly perturbed time-dependent reaction-advection-diffusion equations exhibit internal moving transition layers with sharp gradients, and thus the standard PINN becomes ineffective. In this work, we propose a deep asymptotic expansion (DAE) method, which is inspired by asymptotic analysis and leverages deep learning to approximate the smooth part of the expansion. We first derive the governing equations for transition layers, which are then solved using PINN. Numerical experiments show that the DAE outperforms the standard PINN, gPINN, and PINN with adaptive sampling. We also show its robustness with respect to training point distributions, network architectures, and random seeds."

This work investigates fluctuations in a class of random dynamical systems, arising from randomly perturbing a piecewise smooth expanding interval map with more than one invariant subinterval. Upon perturbation, this invariance is destroyed, allowing trajectories to switch between subintervals, giving rise to metastable behaviour. We show that the distributions of jumps of a time-homogeneous Markov chain approximate the distributions of jumps for random metastable systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approximation extends to the diffusion coefficient for (random) observables of such systems. As an example, our results are applied to Horan's random paired tent maps."

In this paper, we deal with the corresponding discrete Hilbert-type operators acting on the weighted sequence spaces. We establish some sufficient and necessary conditions for the $l^{p}-l^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. We find out that the conditions of the boundedness of discrete Hilbert-type operators are different from those of the boundedness of Hilbert-type integral operators. Also, for some special cases, we obtain sharp norm estimates for discrete Hilbert-type operators. Finally, it is pointed out that certain extensions of the theorems given in [3] can be established by using our different arguments."

We prove that ${\rm GDer}^ω(g) = {\rm QDer}^ω(g) + {\rm QCent}^ω(g)$. We also study the embedding question of compatible quasiderivations of $ω$-Lie superalgebras, demonstrating that ${\rm QDer}^ω(g)$ can be embedded as derivations in a larger $ω$-Lie superalgebra $\breve g$ and furthermore, we obtain a semidirect sum decomposition: ${\rm Der}^ω(\breve{g})=\varphi({\rm QDer}^ω(g))\oplus {\rm ZDer}(\breve{g})$, when the annihilator of $g$ is zero. In particular, for the 3-dimensional complex $ω$-Lie superalgebra $H$, we explicitly calculate ${\rm GDer}(H)$, ${\rm GDer}^ω(H)$, ${\rm QDer}(H)$ and ${\rm QDer}^ω(H)$, and derive the Jordan standard forms of generic elements in these varieties."

A pebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number is the smallest $t$ so that from any initial configuration of $t$ pebbles it is possible, after a sequence of pebbling moves, to place a pebble on any given target vertex. Graphs whose pebbling number is equal to the number of vertices are called Class~$0$ and provide a challenging set of graphs that resist being characterized.

With the Brouwer fixed point theorem, we provide easy to check conditions for the existence of mean field game equilibrium controls for both the discounted and ergodic control problem, characterize them as the solution of an integro-differential equation and show with a counterexample that uniqueness does not always holds. Furthermore, we study the convergence of equilibrium controls in the abelian sense. Finally, we treat the convergence of a finite-player game to this problem to justify our approach."

From the null mnema M0 and iterated labeled extensions by D, we form the free category M and its sheaf topos Sh(M). We prove:
  Modal completeness: Lawvere-Tierney topologies on Sh(M) classify all standard modal logics (K, T, S4, S5) purely via submonoids of the free monoid D*.
  Fixed-point expressivity: The internal mu-calculus over infinite branching realizes the full Janin-Walukiewicz theorem.
  ZFC and Set-modeling: Sh(M) embeds Set via constant sheaves and internalizes a model of ZFC by recursive descent.
  Turing encodability: Finite-automaton and Turing-machine sheaves arise syntactically, yielding a fully mechanizable internal semantics.
  Internal meta-theorems: Godel completeness and Lowenheim-Skolem hold internally via total descent and vanishing first cohomology H1.
  We further construct faithful geometric embeddings:
  Set -> Sh(M) -> Eff, and Sh(M) -> sSet,
  connecting to realizability and simplicial frameworks. Unlike HoTT and classical site-theoretic models, Sh(M) exhibits total cohomological triviality, no torsors, and fully conservative gluing of all local data. Thus, we realize Lawvere's vision of deriving semantics-modal, set-theoretic, computational, and meta-logical-entirely from one syntactic axiom, unifying logic, semantics, and computation under a single recursive principle."

2505.22916,On the Resolution of Stochastic MPECs over Networks: Distributed Implicit Zeroth-Order Gradient Tracking Methods,['math.OC'],"['Mohammadjavad Ebrahimi', 'Uday V. Shanbhag', 'Farzad Yousefian']","The mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is a powerful yet challenging class of constrained optimization problems, where the constraints are characterized by a parametrized variational inequality (VI) problem. While efficient algorithms for addressing MPECs and their stochastic variants (SMPECs) have been recently presented, distributed SMPECs over networks pose significant challenges. This work aims to develop fully iterative methods with complexity guarantees for resolving distributed SMPECs in two problem settings: (1) distributed single-stage SMPECs and (2) distributed two-stage SMPECs. In both cases, the global objective function is distributed among a network of agents that communicate cooperatively. Under the assumption that the parametrized VI is uniquely solvable, the resulting implicit problem in upper-level decisions is generally neither convex nor smooth. Under some standard assumptions, including the uniqueness of the solution to the VI problems and the Lipschitz continuity of the implicit global objective function, we propose single-stage and two-stage zeroth-order distributed gradient tracking optimization methods where the gradient of a smoothed implicit objective function is approximated using two (possibly inexact) evaluations of the lower-level VI solutions. In the exact setting of both the single-stage and two-stage problems, we achieve the best-known complexity bound for centralized nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic optimization. This complexity bound is also achieved (for the first time) for our method in addressing the inexact setting of the distributed two-stage SMPEC. In addressing the inexact setting of the single-stage problem, we derive an overall complexity bound, improving the dependence on the dimension compared to the existing results for the centralized SMPECs."
2505.22903,Non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastic systems with almost surely invariant manifolds,"['math.DS', 'math.PR']","['Jacob Bedrossian', 'Alex Blumenthal', 'Sam Punshon-Smith']","We develop a general framework for establishing non-uniqueness of stationary measures for stochastically forced dynamical systems possessing an almost surely invariant submanifold. Our main abstract result provides sufficient conditions for the existence of multiple stationary measures on compact manifolds, though the underlying methodology extends to non-compact settings. The key insight is to construct additional stationary measures by exploiting the linear instability of the invariant submanifold, as quantified by a positive transverse Lyapunov exponent.
  To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we apply it to the Lorenz 96 model with degenerate stochastic forcing, which serves as an example of both non-compact and high-dimensional dynamics. We prove that as the damping parameter becomes sufficiently small, the unique stationary measure bifurcates, giving rise to exactly two distinct stationary measures. The proof combines our general theory with computer-assisted verification of certain Lie algebra generation properties that ensure the required hypoellipticity and irreducibility conditions."

Furthermore, we give a complete description of the point spectrum."
2505.22900,A Closer Look at Chapoton's q-Ehrhart Polynomials,['math.CO'],"['Matthias Beck', 'Thomas Kunze']","If $\mathcal{P}$ is a lattice polytope (i.e., $\mathcal{P}$ is the convex hull of finitely many integer points in $\mathbb{R}^d$), Ehrhart's famous theorem (1962) asserts that the integer-point counting function $|t \mathcal{P} \cap \mathbb{Z}^d|$ is a polynomial in the integer variable $t$. Chapoton (2016) proved that, given a fixed integral form $λ: \mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathbb{Z}$, there exists a polynomial $\text{cha}_\mathcal{P}^λ(q,x) \in \mathbb{Q}(q)[x]$ such that the refined enumeration function $\sum_{ \mathbf{m} \in t \mathcal{P} } q^{ λ(\mathbf{m}) }$ equals the evaluation $\text{cha}_\mathcal{P}^λ(q, [t]_q)$ where, as usual, $[t]_q := \frac{ q^t - 1 }{ q-1 }$; naturally, for $q=1$ we recover the Ehrhart polynomial. Our motivating goal is to view Chapoton's work through the lens of Brion's Theorem (1988), which expresses the integer-point structure of a given polytope via that of its vertex cones. It turns out that this viewpoint naturally yields various refinements and extensions of Chapoton's results, including explicit formulas for $\text{cha}_\mathcal{P}^λ(q,x)$, its leading coefficient, and its behavior as $t \to \infty$. We also prove an analogue of Chapoton's structural and reciprocity theorems for rational polytopes (i.e., with vertices in $\mathbb{Q}^d$)."

Our contributions include new tools for analysing contiguity and total variation distance between random regular graph models, a novel procedure for generating unions of random edge-disjoint perfect matchings, and refined estimates of Gao's bounds on the number of perfect matchings in random regular graphs.

In each case, we show the number of circles which separate the points into subsets of size k and l is independent of the configuration of points, and we provide an explicit formula in each case. We also consider how the circles change as the configuration of dots varies continuously. We show that an associated higher order Voronoi decomposition of the sphere changes by a sequence of local `moves'. As a consequence, an associated cluster algebra is independent of the configuration of dots, and only depends on the number of dots and the order of the Voronoi decomposition."

In this paper we introduce the Eigenlift algorithm for sampling random FUNTFs. Our approach exploits the symplectic geometry of the FUNTF space, which we characterize as a symplectic reduction of frame space by a symmetry group. We then define a Hamiltonian torus action on this reduced space whose momentum map induces a fiber bundle structure. The algorithm proceeds by sampling a point from the base space, which is a convex polytope, lifting it deterministically to a point on the corresponding fiber, then acting on this point by a random element of the torus to obtain a random FUNTF. We implement the method in Python and validate it in low-dimensional settings where it is computationally feasible to sample the base polytope via rejection sampling."

The conditions we identify show, perhaps surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning."

We prove that the CMPC framework inherits the robust recursive feasibility properties of the underlying RMPC scheme, thereby ensuring safety of the CMPC in the sense of constraint satisfaction. The CMPC leverages the LB-MPC to safely learn the unmodeled dynamics to reduce conservatism and improve performance compared to standalone RMPC schemes, which are conservative in nature. In addition, we present an implementation of the CMPC framework that combines a particular RMPC and a Gaussian Process MPC scheme.

Our bound exceeds the classical Shearer radius and it is derived through a refined application of the Fernández-Procacci criterion using properties of the local neighborhood structure in claw-free graphs. Second, we establish a novel combinatorial expression for $Z_G(z)$, inspired by the connection with the abstract polymer gas models in statistical mechanics, which offers a new structural interpretation of the polynomial and may be of independent interest.

We utilize the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which ensures the existence of its unique fixed point that is then shown to be the unique global minimizer for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax parametrized policies in the mean-field regime."

Sela'],"The JSJ decomposition and the Makanin-Razborov diagram were proved to be essential in studying varieties over free groups, semigroups and associative algebras. In this paper we suggest a unified conceptual approach to the applicability of these structures over all these algebraic categories. With a variety over each of these algebraic categories we naturally associate a set of tuples in a free group. Then we show how to associate a Makanin-Razborov diagram with any set of tuples over a free group. Furthermore, in case the MR diagram that is associated with a set of tuples is single ended, we prove that there is a canonical Makanin-Razborov diagram that can be associated with such a set. This canonical diagram is a main key in studying varieties over free semigroups, associative algebras and Lie algebras, and encodes the global structure of these varieties. It enables us to define a (pseudo) closure of a set of tuples over each of the algebraic objects, associate a rank with it (analogous to Shelah and Lascar ranks), and over free groups the closure provides a canonical envelope that is essential in studying the structure and the properties of definable sets."
2505.22750,Quadratic convergence of an SQP method for some optimization problems with applications to control theory,"['math.OC', 'math.AP']","['Eduardo Casas', 'Mariano Mateos']","We analyze a sequential quadratic programming algorithm for solving a class of abstract optimization problems. Assuming that the initial point is in an $L^2$ neighborhood of a local solution that satisfies no-gap second-order sufficient optimality conditions and a strict complementarity condition, we obtain stability and quadratic convergence in $L^q$ for all $q\in[p,\infty]$ where $p\geq 2$ depends on the problem. Many of the usual optimal control problems of partial differential equations fit into this abstract formulation. Some examples are given in the paper. Finally, a computational comparison with other versions of the SQP method is presented."

2505.22672,Gaussian integrals on symmetric spaces (the complex case and beyond),['math.PR'],['Salem Said'],"The present work is concerned with Gaussian integrals on simply connected non-positively curved Riemannian symmetric spaces. It is motivated by the aim of explicitly finding the high-rank limit of these integrals for each of the eleven families of classical Riemannian symmetric spaces. To begin, it deals with the easier complex case (where the isometry group admits a complex Lie group structure). To go beyond this case, it introduces a variational characterisation of the high-rank limit, as the minimum of a certain energy functional over the space of probability distributions on the real line. Using this new variational formulation, it is possible to recover the high-rank limit in closed form, from the expression originally found in the complex case. This two-step approach is illustrated through the examples of two kinds of symmetric spaces : symmetric cones and classical symmetric domains. Gaussian integrals on symmetric spaces, and particularly their high-rank limits, have proved important in both statistics and theoretical physics. The present work proposes an approach for dealing with these limits, which has the merit of yielding general, concrete, closed-form results."
2505.22671,Teaching Mathematics for Economists,['math.HO'],['Eric Hillebrand'],"In this chapter, I discuss teaching mathematical tools specifically tailored for economics students. A typical one-semester course in this area seeks to blend a range of topics: from foundational elements of subjects such as linear algebra and multivariate calculus to intermediate areas like real and convex analysis and further into advanced topics such as dynamic optimization in both continuous and discrete time. This breadth of coverage corresponds to material usually spread across multiple years in traditional mathematics programs. Given the comprehensive nature of these courses, careful selection of topics is essential, balancing numerous trade-offs. I discuss potential course sequences and instructional design choices. I then focus on conceptualizing and explaining mathematical modeling in economics. I reflect on three years of teaching an advanced undergraduate course in mathematical methods online. The latter part of the chapter offers examples and visualizations I have found particularly beneficial for imparting intuition to economics students. They cover a range of topics at different degrees of difficulty and are meant as a resource for instructors in Mathematics for Economists. Among these, I use the Ramsey model as a recurring example, especially relevant when designing a mathematical tools course with an orientation towards preparing students for macroeconomic analysis."

Furthermore, the converse assertion of this statement is also established.
  On the other hand, a sequence $\Big(u_n\Big)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is called approximately subadditive if for a fixed $ε>0$ and any partition $n_1,\cdots,n_k$ of $n\in\mathbb{N}$; the following discrete functional inequality holds true $$ u_n\leq u_{n_1}+\cdots+ u_{n_k}+\varepsilon. $$ We show Ulam's type stability result for such sequences. We prove that an approximately subadditive sequence can be expressed as the algebraic summation of an ordinary subadditive and a non-negative sequence bounded above by $\varepsilon.$
  A proposition portraying the linkage between the convex and subadditive sequences under minimal assumption is also included."

The scheme directly solves the relaxation system using a relatively coarse mesh and captures the equilibrium behavior quite well, even in the presence of boundary layers. This method extends the concept of asymptotic-preserving schemes from initial-value problems to IBVPs. Moreover, we apply this idea to design a unified numerical scheme for the interface problem of relaxation systems."

Among many other capabilities, PyRigi can determine whether a graph admits only finitely many ways, up to isometries, of being drawn in the plane once the edge lengths are fixed, whether it has a unique embedding, or whether it satisfied such properties even after the removal of any of its edges. By implementing algorithms from the scientific literature, PyRigi enables the exploration of rigidity properties of structures that would be out of reach for computations by hand. With reliable and robust algorithms, as well as clear, well-documented methods that are closely connected to the underlying mathematical definitions and results, PyRigi aims to be a practical and powerful general-purpose tool for the working mathematician interested in rigidity theory. PyRigi is open source and easy to use, and awaits researchers to benefit from its computational potential."
2505.22646,Path-Dependent SDEs: Solutions and Parameter Estimation,"['math.ST', 'math.PR']","['Pardis Semnani', 'Vincent Guan', 'Elina Robeva', 'Darrick Lee']","We develop a consistent method for estimating the parameters of a rich class of path-dependent SDEs, called signature SDEs, which can model general path-dependent phenomena. Path signatures are iterated integrals of a given path with the property that any sufficiently nice function of the path can be approximated by a linear functional of its signatures. This is why we model the drift and diffusion of our signature SDE as linear functions of path signatures. We provide conditions that ensure the existence and uniqueness of solutions to a general signature SDE. We then introduce the Expected Signature Matching Method (ESMM) for linear signature SDEs, which enables inference of the signature-dependent drift and diffusion coefficients from observed trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that ESMM is consistent: given sufficiently many samples and Picard iterations used by the method, the parameters estimated by the ESMM approach the true parameter with arbitrary precision. Finally, we demonstrate on a variety of empirical simulations that our ESMM accurately infers the drift and diffusion parameters from observed trajectories. While parameter estimation is often restricted by the need for a suitable parametric model, this work makes progress toward a completely general framework for SDE parameter estimation, using signature terms to model arbitrary path-independent and path-dependent processes."
2505.22640,On the categorification of homology,"['math.AT', 'math.CT', 'math.KT']",['Hadrian Heine'],"We categorify the concept of homology theories, which we term categorical homology theories. More precisely, we extend the notion of homology theory from homotopy theory to the realm of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories and show that several desirable features remain: we prove that categorical homology theories are homological in a precise categorified sense, satisfy a categorified Whitehead theorem and are classified by a higher categorical analogue of spectra. To study categorical homology theories we categorify stable homotopy theory and the concept of stable $(\infty,1)$-category. As guiding example of a categorical homology theory we study the categorification of homology, the categorical homology theory whose coefficients are the commutative monoid of natural numbers, which we term categorical homology. We prove that categorical homology admits a description analogous to singular homology that replaces the singular complex of a space by the nerve of an $(\infty,\infty)$-category. We show a categorified version of the Dold-Thom theorem and Hurewicz theorem, compute categorical homology of the globes, the walking higher cells, and prove that categorical $R$-homology with coeffients in a rig $R$ multiplicatively lifts to the higher category of $(R,R)$-bimodules."

Our approach relies on a detailed study of pairs of quadratic embeddings, which ultimately enables a reduction from the biquadratic case of GL(4) to the coquadratic case of GL(2). We further identify conditions under which the biquadratic case can be derived from the coquadratic case, and show that this reduction allows us to establish the conjectures for all orbits in GL(4). As an additional consequence, we also prove the biquadratic FL for the identity test function in certain special families of orbits in GL(2n). All results hold over both p-adic fields and local fields of positive characteristic."

In this work, we introduce Multi-Environment Generalized Long AMP, a novel AMP framework that applies to transfer learning problems with multiple data sources and distribution shifts. We rigorously establish state evolution for multi-environment GLAMP. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by precisely characterizing the risk of three Lasso-based transfer learning estimators for the first time: the Stacked Lasso, the Model Averaging Estimator, and the Second Step Estimator. We also demonstrate the remarkable finite sample accuracy of our theory via extensive simulations."

Furthermore, we present vertical $C$-anisotropic conformal changes and demonstrate that they are characterized by the property of $(M,F)$ being Riemannian. Additionally, we examine the anisotropic conformal transformation that fulfils the $φT$-condition, the horizontal $φT$-condition, and the vertical $φT$-condition. The first two conditions reduce to the $\boldsymbolσ T$-condition when the conformal factor relies solely on a positional variable. We demonstrate that, under the vertical $φT$-condition change, every Landsberg surface is Berwaldian. Thus, the vertical $φT$-condition is equivalent to the $T$-condition. Furthermore, we examine the scenario when the anisotropic conformal factor becomes the main scalar of the non-Riemannian surface $(M,F)$. We present an example of a Finslerian Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution having Finslerian spherical symmetry and apply our results to it."

2505.22585,A recursive method for computing singular solutions in corners with homogeneous Dirichlet-Robin boundary condition with power-law coefficient variation,['math.AP'],"['N. Piña-León', 'V. Mantič', 'S. Jiménez-Alfaro']","This study introduces a recursive method for computing asymptotic solutions of the Laplace equation in corner domains with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on one side and the Robin boundary condition with a power-law coefficient variation with exponent $α\in \mathbb{R}$ on the other side (D-R corner problem). An asymptotic solution of this D-R corner problem is given as the sum of a main term, the solution of either a homogeneous Dirichlet-Neumann (D-N) or Dirichlet-Dirichlet (D-D) corner problem, and a finite or infinite series of the associated higher-order shadow terms by using harmonic basis functions with power-logarithmic terms. To determine this series of shadow terms, it is shown that the recursive procedures based on recursive non-homogeneous D-N or D-D corner problems are always convergent for $α> -1$ or $α< -1$, respectively. For the critical case $α=-1$, the closed form expression of the asymptotic solution is given. Asymptotic solutions for several relevant D-R corner problems are derived and analysed. Two of these examples are applied to the problem of bridged cracks in antiplane Mode III in linear elastic fracture mechanics. The results presented can be applied to many other physical and engineering applications, such as heat transfer with the thermal resistance condition, acoustics and electrostatics with the impedance condition, and elasticity and structural analysis with the Winkler spring boundary condition."
2505.22580,A hybrid PDE-ABM model for angiogenesis and tumour microenvironment with application to resistance in cancer treatment,['math.NA'],"['Louis Shuo Wang', 'Jiguang Yu', 'Zonghao Liu']","The main obstacle to effective cancer treatment is the development of drug resistance, which can be divided into two categories: spontaneous and acquired drug resistance. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. A subset of lung cancer, adenocarcinomas, is characterised by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Treatment of EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinomas has become less effective over time due to drug resistance development, which is associated with a second mutation in the EGFR gene. An important factor in the development of cancer is angiogenesis, which is the formation of blood vessels from the existing vasculature. These newly formed blood vessels provide oxygen and nutrients to tumour cells to maintain tumour growth and proliferation. We applied a hybrid discrete-continuous (HDC) model to capture the dynamic vasculature in the tumour microenvironment (TME). In the case of pre-existing resistance, the formation of angiogenic networks creates a microenvironment that supports tumour survival and enhances drug resistance. In the case of spontaneous mutation-induced resistance, earlier and more frequent mutations confer a greater survival advantage to the tumour population. There is also a mutually reinforcing relationship between a high proliferation rate and high resistance characteristics. These findings explain two conflicting experimental results about the second mutation in NSCLC."

We define the tensor product of graphs embedded in pseudo-surfaces and use this to generalize and unify all of the above results, providing Brylawski-style formulas for both the Bollobás-Riordan and Krushkal polynomials."
2505.22565,The Ingleton inequality holds for metacyclic groups and fails for supersoluble groups,"['math.GR', 'cs.IT']",['David A. Craven'],"The Ingleton inequality first appeared in matroid theory, where Ingleton proved in 1971 that every rank function coming from a representable matroid on four subsets satisfies a particular inequality. Because this inequality is not implied by submodularity, Shannon-type axioms alone, it and various analogues play a central role in separately linear and non-linear phenomena in a variety of areas of mathematics. The Ingleton inequality for finite groups concerns the various intersections of four subgroups. It holds for many quadruples of subgroups of finite groups, but not all, the smallest example being four subgroups of $S_5$, of order 120. Open questions are whether the Inlgeton inequality always holds for metacycle and nilpotent groups. (There is a proof in the literature due to Oggier and Stancu, but there is an already known issue with their proof, which we address in this article.)
  In this paper we prove that the Ingleton inequality always holds for metacycle groups, but that it fails for supersoluble groups, a class of groups only a little larger than nilpotent groups. Although we do not resolve the nilpotent case here we do make some reductions, and also prove that there are no nilpotent violators of the Ingleton inequality of order less than 1024. We end with a list of Ingleton inequality violating groups of order at most 1023.
  The article comes with a Magma package that allows reproduction of all results in the paper and for the reader to check the Ingleton inequality for any given finite group."

The main theorem establishes that invariant predicates on $D_\infty$ parametrize cuspidal automorphic representations, preserving $L$-functions. We provide complete proofs using $\infty$-categorical techniques, explicit computations for small cases, and establish connections to discrete conformal field theory. As applications, we resolve the Carlitz-Drinfeld uniformization conjecture for function fields and compute previously unknown motivic cohomology groups.

We utilize a quantum Perron-Frobenius theorem that provides a spectral characterization of connectivity, and we further characterize connectivity in terms of the irreducibility of the quantum adjacency matrix and the nullity of the associated graph Laplacian.

2505.22498,Lanczos with compression for symmetric matrix Lyapunov equations,['math.NA'],"['Angelo A. Casulli', 'Francesco Hrobat', 'Daniel Kressner']","This work considers large-scale Lyapunov matrix equations of the form $AX + XA = \boldsymbol{c}\boldsymbol{c}^T$, where $A$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix and $\boldsymbol{c}$ is a vector. Motivated by the need to solve such equations in a wide range of applications, various numerical methods have been developed to compute low-rank approximations of the solution matrix $X$. In this work, we focus on the Lanczos method, which has the distinct advantage of requiring only matrix-vector products with $A$, making it broadly applicable. However, the Lanczos method may suffer from slow convergence when $A$ is ill-conditioned, leading to excessive memory requirements for storing the Krylov subspace basis generated by the algorithm. To address this issue, we propose a novel compression strategy for the Krylov subspace basis that significantly reduces memory usage without hindering convergence. This is supported by both numerical experiments and a convergence analysis. Our analysis also accounts for the loss of orthogonality due to round-off errors in the Lanczos process."

We allow the Fourier transform of $μ_n$ to be a genuine distribution. Let $u^n$ be the mild solution to these equations. We provide sufficient conditions on the measures $μ_n$ and the initial data to ensure that $u^n$ converges in law, in the space of continuous functions, to the solution of our equations driven by a noise with spectral measure $μ$, where $μ_n\toμ$ in some sense. We apply our main result to various types of noises, such as the anisotropic fractional noise. We also show that we cover existing results in the literature, such as the case of Riesz kernels and the fractional noise with $d=1$."

2505.22471,Phase transitions for contact processes on sparse random graphs via metastability and local limits,['math.PR'],"['Benedikt Jahnel', 'Lukas Lüchtrath', 'Christian Mönch']","We propose a new perspective on the asymptotic regimes of fast and slow extinction in the contact process on locally converging sequences of sparse finite graphs. We characterise the phase boundary by the existence of a metastable density, which makes the study of the phase transition particularly amenable to local-convergence techniques. We use this approach to derive general conditions for the coincidence of the critical threshold with the survival/extinction threshold in the local limit. We further argue that the correct time scale to separate fast extinction from slow extinction in sparse graphs is, in general, the exponential scale, by showing that fast extinction may occur on stretched exponential time scales in sparse scale-free spatial networks. Together with recent results by Nam, Nguyen and Sly (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 375, 2022), our methods can be applied to deduce that the fast/slow threshold in sparse configuration models coincides with the survival/extinction threshold on the limiting Galton-Watson tree."

We show that when the matrices represent linear operators preserving a cone and satisfying a ""strict positivity"" assumption, the competitive spectral radius depends continuously - and even in a Lipschitz-continuous way - on the matrix sets. Moreover, we show that the competive spectral radius can be approximated up to any accuracy. This relies on the solution of a discretized infinite dimensional non-linear eigenproblem.

In the case of a connected spectrum this data determines the unitary equivalence class of the operator, and may be reduced to to the case of an operator with spectrum equal to the closed unit interval.

Rates of convergence are also analyzed based on feasible sequences $\{k_{n}\}$. We work in three dependence settings: independence, Dedecker and Prieur's (2004) $τ$-mixing and Wu's (2005) physical dependence. We initially ignore cross-coordinate $i$ dependence as a benchmark. We then work with martingale, nearly martingale, and mixing coordinates to deliver improved bounds on $k_{n}$. Finally, we use the results in three applications, each representing a key novelty: we ($i$) bound $k_{n}$\ for a max-correlation statistic for regression residuals under $α$-mixing or physical dependence; ($ii$) extend correlation screening, or marginal regressions, to physical dependent data with diverging dimension $k_{n}$ $\rightarrow $ $\infty $; and ($iii$) test a high dimensional parameter after partialling out a fixed dimensional nuisance parameter in a linear time series regression model under $τ$% -mixing."
2505.22417,High-Dimensional Binary Variates: Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Nonstationary Covariates and Factors,['math.ST'],"['Xinbing Kong', 'Bin Wu', 'Wuyi Ye']","This paper introduces a high-dimensional binary variate model that accommodates nonstationary covariates and factors, and studies their asymptotic theory. This framework encompasses scenarios where single indices are nonstationary or cointegrated. For nonstationary single indices, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the coefficients has dual convergence rates and is collectively consistent under the condition $T^{1/2}/N\to0$, as both the cross-sectional dimension $N$ and the time horizon $T$ approach infinity. The MLE of all nonstationary factors is consistent when $T^δ/N\to0$, where $δ$ depends on the link function. The limiting distributions of the factors depend on time $t$, governed by the convergence of the Hessian matrix to zero. In the case of cointegrated single indices, the MLEs of both factors and coefficients converge at a higher rate of $\min(\sqrt{N},\sqrt{T})$. A distinct feature compared to nonstationary single indices is that the dual rate of convergence of the coefficients increases from $(T^{1/4},T^{3/4})$ to $(T^{1/2},T)$. Moreover, the limiting distributions of the factors do not depend on $t$ in the cointegrated case. Monte Carlo simulations verify the accuracy of the estimates. In an empirical application, we analyze jump arrivals in financial markets using this model, extract jump arrival factors, and demonstrate their efficacy in large-cross-section asset pricing."

We consider a solution method that is based on a continuous approximation of the projected gradient flow - referred to as the safe gradient flow - that incorporates voltage and current information obtained either through real-time measurements or power flow computations. These two setups enable both online and offline implementations. The safe gradient flow involves the solution of convex quadratic programs (QPs). To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a novel framework that employs a neural network approximation of the optimal solution map of the QP. The resulting method has two key features: (a) it ensures that the DERs' setpoints are practically feasible, even for an online implementation or when an offline algorithm has an early termination; (b) it ensures convergence to a neighborhood of a strict local optimizer of the AC OPF. The proposed method is tested on a 93-node distribution system with realistic loads and renewable generation. The test shows that our method successfully regulates voltages within limits during periods with high renewable generation."

Nobuyoshi Takahashi formulated a conjecture that expresses counts of rational curves of varying degree in $\mathbb{P}^2\setminus E$ as the Taylor coefficients of a particular period integral of a pencil of affine plane cubics after reparametrizing the pencil using the exponential of a second period integral.
  The intrinsic mirror construction introduced by Mark Gross and the third author associates to a degeneration of $(\mathbb{P}^2, E)$ a canonical wall structure from which one constructs a family of projective plane cubics that is birational to Takahashi's pencil in its reparametrized form. By computing the period integral of the positive real locus explicitly, we find that it equals the logarithm of the product of all asymptotic wall functions. The coefficients of these asymptotic wall functions are logarithmic Gromov-Witten counts of the central fiber of the degeneration that agree with the algebraic curve counts in $(\mathbb{P}^2,E)$ in question. We conclude that Takahashi's conjecture is a natural consequence of intrinsic mirror symmetry. Our method generalizes to give similar results for log Calabi-Yau varieties of arbitrary dimension."

2505.22350,New chaos decomposition of Gaussian nodal volumes,"['math.PR', 'math.DG']","['Michele Stecconi', 'Anna Paola Todino']","We investigate the random variable defined by the volume of the zero set of a smooth Gaussian field, on a general Riemannian manifold possibly with boundary, a fundamental object in probability and geometry. We prove a new explicit formula for its Wiener-Itô chaos decomposition that is notably simpler than existing alternatives and which holds in greater generality, without requiring the field to be compatible with the geometry of the manifold. A key advantage of our formulation is a significant reduction in the complexity of computing the variance of the nodal volume. Unlike the standard Hermite expansion, which requires evaluating the expectation of products of $2+2n$ Hermite polynomials, our approach reduces this task--in any dimension $n$--to computing the expectation of a product of just four Hermite polynomials. As a consequence, we establish a new exact formula for the variance, together with lower and upper bounds. Importantly, in contrast to previous results, our approach applies to highly non-isotropic situations, allowing the study of Riemannian random waves on arbitrary manifolds. By introducing two parameters associated to any Gaussian field: the frequency and the eccentricity, we quantify the deviation from the standard settings (e.g., spheres) and establish a quantitative version of Berry's cancellation phenomenon valid on all manifolds."

In this paper, we propose a possible generalization of the set of signals and we study some properties of the more general set of vector-valued signals, which take values into any Banach space, and some properties of the fundamental operators of vertex-frequency analysis acting on these signals, such as the Fourier transform, the convolution operator and the translation operator. In particular, we show some estimates involving their operator norm as linear operators between Banach spaces and we establish a graph version of the classical primary uncertainty principle. We also show how these estimates depend on the choice of an orthonormal basis of $\mathbb{K}^N$. The importance of considering this general set of signals derives from the possibility to study multiple signals at the same time and the correlation existing between them, since multiple scalar signals can be modelled as a unique vector-valued signal."

2505.22278,A Coupled Hydro-Morphodynamic Model for Sediment Transport using the Moment Approach,"['math.NA', 'physics.geo-ph']","['Afroja Parvin', 'Giovanni Samaey', 'Julian Koellermeier']","Sediment transport is crucial in the hydro-morphodynamic evolution of free surface flows in shallow water environments, which is typically modeled under the shallow water assumption. In classical shallow water modeling for sediment transport, the vertical structure of the flow is collapsed into a depth-averaged and near-bed velocity, usually reconstructed empirically, e.g., using a parameterized logarithmic profile. In practice, large variations from such empirical profiles can occur. It is therefore essential to resolve the vertical structure of the velocity profile within the shallow water framework to better approximate near-bed velocity. This study introduces a model and simulations that incorporate vertical velocity variations and bottom erosion-deposition effects in sediment transport, providing a computationally efficient framework for predicting sediment dynamics in shallow water environments. We employ the so-called moment model approach for the velocity variation, which considers a polynomial expansion of the horizontal velocity in the scaled vertical direction. This allows the use of a complex velocity profile with an extended set of variables determined by the polynomial basis coefficients, resolving the vertical structure as part of the solution. The extended model comprises four components: (1) the standard shallow water equations; (2) moment equations governing evolution of the basis coefficients; (3) an evolution equation for sediment concentration; and (4) a transport equation for the bed. This enables a coupled model for bedload and suspended load transport. We use a hyperbolic regularization technique to ensure model stability and realistic eigenvalues. Several numerical tests, including dam-break cases with and without wet/dry fronts, validate our results against laboratory data."

We show that this problem is NP-hard and derive both lower and upper bounds for the optimal solution by leveraging a special case of the classic $p$-Median problem. To overcome the computational challenges, we propose two Bayesian optimization approaches: (i) a parametric method that employs a sparse Bayesian linear model with a horseshoe prior (SparBL), and (ii) a non-parametric method based on a Gaussian process surrogate model with $p$-Median as mean prior (GP-$p$M). We prove that both algorithms achieve sublinear regret rates and converge to the optimal solution, with the parametric approach demonstrating particular effectiveness in high-dimensional settings. Numerical experiments and a case study using real-world data from St. Paul, Minnesota emergency response system show that our approaches consistently and efficiently identify optimal solutions, significantly outperforming the $p$-Median solution and other baselines."

These algorithms involve only algebraic manipulations and are computationally cheap. To the best of our knowledge, they are first direct algorithms for the inverse conductivity problem in the context of the subdiffusion model. Moreover, we provide relevant theoretical underpinnings for the algorithms. Also we present numerical results to illustrate their performance under various scenarios, e.g., the size of inclusions, noise level of the data, and the number of inclusions, showing that the algorithms are efficient and robust."
2505.22241,An Exact System Optimum Assignment Model for Transit Demand Management,['math.OC'],"['Xia Zhou', 'Mark Wallace', 'Daniel D. Harabor', 'Zhenliang Ma']","Mass transit systems are experiencing increasing congestion in many cities. The schedule-based transit assignment problem (STAP) involves a joint choice model for departure times and routes, defining a space-time path in which passengers decide when to depart and which route to take. User equilibrium (UE) models for the STAP indicates the current congestion cost, while a system optimum (SO) models can provide insights for congestion relief directions. However, current STAP methods rely on approximate SO (Approx. SO) models, which underestimate the potential for congestion reduction in the system. The few studies in STAP that compute exact SO solutions ignore realistic constraints such as hard capacity, multi-line networks, or spatial-temporal competing demand flows. The paper proposes an exact SO method for the STAP that overcomes these limitations. We apply our approach to a case study involving part of the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway network, which includes 5 lines, 12 interacting origin-destination pairs and 52,717 passengers. Computing an Approx. SO solution for this system indicates a modest potential for congestion reduction measures, with a cost reduction of 17.39% from the UE solution. Our exact SO solution is 36.35% lower than the UE solution, which is more than double the potential for congestion reduction. We then show how the exact SO solution can be used to identify opportunities for congestion reduction: (i) which origin-destination pairs have the most potential to reduce congestion; (ii) how many passengers can be reasonably shifted; (iii) future system potential with increasing demand and expanding network capacity."

We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps from spin curves to the bosonic reduction of the target, whose fibers are linear schemes; for this reason, the moduli superstack of stable supermaps is not proper unless such linear schemes reduce to a point. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the moduli superstack, which agrees with the characterization of the bosonic reduction just mentioned and with the dimension formula for the case of bosonic target existing in the literature."

(2011). Directional dependence in multivariate distributions. Ann. Inst. Stat. Math 64, 677-685] by extending it to encompass arbitrary dimensions and directions in multivariate space. We provide a generalized definition and establish its fundamental properties. Moreover, we resolve a conjecture from the aforementioned work by proving a more general result applicable to any dimension, correcting a result in [García, J.E., González-López, V.A., Nelsen, R.B.

Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of multivariate dependence and association, offering novel tools for detecting directional dependencies in high-dimensional settings. Finally, we introduce nonparametric estimators, based on ranks, for estimating directional $ρ$-coefficients from a sample."

2505.22180,Some iterative algorithms on Riemannian manifolds and Banach spaces with good global convergence guarantee,"['math.OC', 'math.DS']",['Tuyen Trung Truong'],"In this paper, we introduce some new iterative optimisation algorithms on Riemannian manifolds and Hilbert spaces which have good global convergence guarantees to local minima. More precisely, these algorithms have the following properties: If $\{x_n\}$ is a sequence constructed by one such algorithm then:
  - Finding critical points: Any cluster point of $\{x_n\}$ is a critical point of the cost function $f$.
  - Convergence guarantee: Under suitable assumptions, the sequence $\{x_n\}$ either converges to a point $x^*$, or diverges to $\infty$.
  - Avoidance of saddle points: If $x_0$ is randomly chosen, then the sequence $\{x_n\}$ cannot converge to a saddle point.
  Our results apply for quite general situations: the cost function $f$ is assumed to be only $C^2$ or $C^3$, and either $f$ has at most countably many critical points (which is a generic situation) or satisfies certain Lojasiewicz gradient inequalities. To illustrate the results, we provide a nice application with optimisation over the unit sphere in a Euclidean space.
  As for tools needed for the results, in the Riemannian manifold case we introduce a notion of ""strong local retraction"" and (to deal with Newton's method type) a notion of ""real analytic-like strong local retraction"". In the case of Banach spaces, we introduce a slight generalisation of the notion of ""shyness"", and design a new variant of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method which is more suitable to the infinite dimensional setting (and in the Euclidean setting is simpler than the current versions)."

Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$."

2505.22124,A Nurse Staffing and Scheduling Problem with Bounded Flexibility and Demand Uncertainty,['math.OC'],"['Si Zhang', 'Paul Mingzheng Tang', 'Hoong Chuin Lau']","Nurse staffing and scheduling are persistent challenges in healthcare due to demand fluctuations and individual nurse preferences. This study introduces the concept of bounded flexibility, balancing nurse satisfaction with strict rostering rules, particularly a real-world time regularity policy from a major hospital in Singapore. We model the problem as a multi-stage stochastic program to address evolving demand, optimizing both aggregate staffing and detailed scheduling decisions. A reformulation into a two-stage structure using block-separable recourse reduces computational burden without loss of accuracy. To solve the problem efficiently, we develop a Generative AI-guided algorithm. Numerical experiments with real hospital data show substantial cost savings and improved nurse flexibility with minimal compromise to schedule regularity. Numerical experiments based on real-world nurse profiles, nurse preferences, and patient demand data are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Our results demonstrate that the stochastic model achieves significant cost savings compared to the deterministic model. Notably, a slight reduction in the regularity level can remarkably enhance nurse flexibility."

To this end use the boundary control method for wave equations established in~\cite{AK,B}. It is shown that under generic assumptions the inverse problem can be solved by applying measurements at all leaves, the root of the tree being fixed."

This is a pointwise equality, so we have required non-standard techniques that involve the study of the sign of certain solutions to linear parabolic problems. This fixed-point equation implies regularity properties of solutions to parabolic problems, not necessarily linear, and this allows us to prove the uniqueness of the solution in three dimensions for the Navier-Stokes problem."

After a Laplace transform in time, we derive the error equation and obtain the convergence factor. The optimal transmission operators are nonlocal, and thus inconvenient to use in practice. We introduce three versions of local approximations for the transmission parameter, and provide a detailed analysis at the continuous level in each case to identify the best local transmission conditions. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the performance of each local transmission condition. As shown in our analysis, local transmission conditions, which are scaled appropriately with respect to the heterogeneous diffusion coefficients, are more efficient and robust especially when the discontinuity of the diffusion coefficient is large."
2505.22085,PADAM: Parallel averaged Adam reduces the error for stochastic optimization in scientific machine learning,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG', 'math.NA']","['Arnulf Jentzen', 'Julian Kranz', 'Adrian Riekert']","Averaging techniques such as Ruppert--Polyak averaging and exponential movering averaging (EMA) are powerful approaches to accelerate optimization procedures of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization methods such as the popular ADAM optimizer. However, depending on the specific optimization problem under consideration, the type and the parameters for the averaging need to be adjusted to achieve the smallest optimization error. In this work we propose an averaging approach, which we refer to as parallel averaged ADAM (PADAM), in which we compute parallely different averaged variants of ADAM and during the training process dynamically select the variant with the smallest optimization error. A central feature of this approach is that this procedure requires no more gradient evaluations than the usual ADAM optimizer as each of the averaged trajectories relies on the same underlying ADAM trajectory and thus on the same underlying gradients. We test the proposed PADAM optimizer in 13 stochastic optimization and deep neural network (DNN) learning problems and compare its performance with known optimizers from the literature such as standard SGD, momentum SGD, Adam with and without EMA, and ADAMW. In particular, we apply the compared optimizers to physics-informed neural network, deep Galerkin, deep backward stochastic differential equation and deep Kolmogorov approximations for boundary value partial differential equation problems from scientific machine learning, as well as to DNN approximations for optimal control and optimal stopping problems. In nearly all of the considered examples PADAM achieves, sometimes among others and sometimes exclusively, essentially the smallest optimization error. This work thus strongly suggest to consider PADAM for scientific machine learning problems and also motivates further research for adaptive averaging procedures within the training of DNNs."
2505.22078,Local cubic spline interpolation for Vlasov-type equations on a multi-patch geometry,['math.NA'],"['Pauline Vidal', 'Emily Bourne', 'Virginie Grandgirard', 'Michel Mehrenberger', 'Eric Sonnendrücker']","We present a semi-Lagrangian method for the numerical resolution of Vlasov-type equations on multi-patch meshes. We employ a local cubic spline interpolation with Hermite boundary conditions between the patches. The derivative reconstruction is adapted to cope with non-uniform meshes as well as non-conforming situations. In the conforming case, there are no longer any constraints on the number of points for each patch; however, a small global system must now be solved. In that case, the local spline representations coincide with the corresponding global spline reconstruction. Alternatively, we can choose not to apply the global system and the derivatives can be approximated. The influence of the most distant points diminishes as the number of points per patch increases. For uniform per patch configurations, a study of the explicit and asymptotic behavior of this influence has been led. The method is validated using a two-dimensional guiding-center model with an O-point. All the numerical results are carried out in the Gyselalib++ library."
2505.22075,Data-Driven Adjustable Robust Optimization,['math.OC'],"['Xiaoxing Ren', 'Alessio Moreschini', 'Zhongda Chu', 'Yulong Gao', 'Thomas Parisini']","In this paper, we develop a two-stage data-driven approach to address the adjustable robust optimization problem, where the uncertainty set is adjustable to manage infeasibility caused by significant or poorly quantified uncertainties. In the first stage, we synthesize an uncertainty set to ensure the feasibility of the problem as much as possible using the collected uncertainty samples. In the second stage, we find the optimal solution while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied under the new uncertainty set. This approach enlarges the feasible state set, at the expense of the risk of possible constraint violation. We analyze two scenarios: one where the uncertainty is non-stochastic, and another where the uncertainty is stochastic but with unknown probability distribution, leading to a distributionally robust optimization problem. In the first case, we scale the uncertainty set and find the best subset that fits the uncertainty samples. In the second case, we employ the Wasserstein metric to quantify uncertainty based on training data, and for polytope uncertainty sets, we further provide a finite program reformulation of the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through an optimal power flow problem."

We hope that our approach will constitute a step towards an eventual proof of Alperin's weight conjecture."

When $m = 2$, determining $χ(J_q(n, 2))$ is equivalent to determining the smallest number of partial line parallelisms that one can partition the lines of PG$(n-1, q)$ into. We survey known results about line parallelisms and their implications for $χ(J_q(n, 2))$. Finally, we prove that when $q$ is any power of two, and $n$ is any even integer, then $χ(J_q(n, 2)) < 2\binom{n-1}{1}_q$."

We develop a two-timescale momentum-accelerated subgradient method (TMG) that employs two-timescale stepsizes, and establish its local convergence when initialized within a sufficiently small neighborhood of the feasible region. To develop a globally convergent algorithm for (BLO), we introduce a feasibility restoration scheme (FRG) that drives iterates toward the feasible region. Both (TMG) and (FRG) only require the first-order derivatives of the upper-level and lower-level objective functions, ensuring efficient computations in practice. We then develop a novel hybrid method that alternates between (TMG) and (FRG) and adaptively estimates its hyperparameters. Under mild conditions, we establish the global convergence properties of our proposed algorithm. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate the high efficiency and promising potential of our proposed algorithm."

We start by providing the literature with characterizations for the various types of infinity-morphisms, the most seminal one being the equivalence between infinity-quasi-isomorphisms and zig-zags of quasi-isomorphisms which plays a key role in the study the formality property. We establish a simplicial enrichment for the categories of gebras over some cofibrant properads together with their infinity-morphisms, whose homotopy category provides us with the localisation with respect to infinity-quasi-isomorphisms. These results extend to the properadic level known properties for operads, but the lack of the rectification procedure in this setting forces us to use different methods."

This phenomenon, known as locking or non-robustness, remains not fully understood despite extensive investigation. In this work, we illustrate first that an analogous instability arises when applying the popular Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to nearly incompressible elasticity problems, leading to significant loss of accuracy and convergence difficulties. Then, to overcome this challenge, we propose a robust decomposition-based PINN framework that reformulates the elasticity equations into balanced subsystems, thereby eliminating the ill-conditioning that causes locking. Our approach simultaneously solves the forward and inverse problems to recover both the decomposed field variables and the associated external conditions. We will also perform a convergence analysis to further enhance the reliability of the proposed approach. Moreover, through various numerical experiments, including constant, variable and parametric Lamé coefficients, we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology."

2505.21950,Winning Probabilities of Balanced and Nontransitive n-tuples of Dice,['math.CO'],['Joshua Rooney'],"For a positive integer $n$, an $n$-tuple of dice $(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n)$ is called balanced if $P(A_1<A_2) = P(A_2<A_3) = \cdots = P(A_n<A_1)$ and nontransitive if $P(A_1<A_2), P(A_2<A_3), \dots, P(A_n<A_1)$ are each greater than $\frac{1}{2}$. For a balanced and nontransitive $n$-tuple of dice $(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n)$, we define the winning probability $w(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n) := P(A_1 < A_2)$. The works of Trybula and Kim et al. together show that for a balanced and nontransitve triple of dice $(A_1,A_2,A_3)$, the least upper bound on the winning probability is $\frac{-1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Kim et al. then asked what the least upper bound on the winning probability was for the $n \geq 4$ cases. Bogdanov and Komisarski independently have shown that for $n\geq 3$ and a balanced and nontransitive $n$-tuple of dice $(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n)$, the winning probability is less than $π_n := 1-\frac{1}{4\cos^2\left( \fracπ{n+2} \right)}$.
  In this paper, we will show that for $n \geq 3$ and every rational $p \in \left( \frac{1}{2}, π_n \right]$, there exists a balanced and nontransitive $n$-tuple of dice with winning probability $p$. Paired with Bogdanov and Komisarski's results, this fully answers the problem posed by Kim et al. and establishes a complete characterization of the winning probabilities for nontransitive and balanced $n$-tuples of dice."
2505.21917,Structured Divide-and-Conquer for the Definite Generalized Eigenvalue Problem,['math.NA'],"['James Demmel', 'Ioana Dumitriu', 'Ryan Schneider']","This paper presents a fast, randomized divide-and-conquer algorithm for the definite generalized eigenvalue problem, which corresponds to pencils $(A,B)$ in which $A$ and $B$ are Hermitian and the Crawford number $γ(A,B) = \min_{||x||_2 = 1} |x^H(A+iB)x|$ is positive. Adapted from the fastest known method for diagonalizing arbitrary matrix pencils [Foundations of Computational Mathematics 2024], the algorithm is both inverse-free and highly parallel. As in the general case, randomization takes the form of perturbations applied to the input matrices, which regularize the problem for compatibility with fast, divide-and-conquer eigensolvers -- i.e., the now well-established phenomenon of pseudospectral shattering. We demonstrate that this high-level approach to diagonalization can be executed in a structure-aware fashion by (1) extending pseudospectral shattering to definite pencils under structured perturbations (either random diagonal or sampled from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble) and (2) formulating the divide-and-conquer procedure in a way that maintains definiteness. The result is a specialized solver whose complexity, when applied to definite pencils, is provably lower than that of general divide-and-conquer."

Absolute concentration robustness (ACR) is a striking homeostatic phenomenon in which the steady-state concentration of a species remains invariant despite changes in total supply. Although experimental studies have reported approximate-but not exact-robustness in steady-state concentrations, such behavior has often been attributed to exact ACR motifs perturbed by measurement noise or minor reactions, rather than recognized as a structural property of a network itself. Here, we introduce a previously underappreciated phenomenon, namely asymptotic ACR (aACR): approximate robustness can emerge solely from the network structure, without requiring exact ACR motifs or negligible parameters. We find that aACR is more pervasive than classical ACR, as demonstrated in systems such as the Escherichia coli EnvZ-OmpR osmoregulation system and a futile cycle. Furthermore, we prove that such ubiquity stems solely from network structure without fine-tuning of kinetic parameters. The notion of aACR provides a rigorous and practical tool to analyze robust responses in broad biochemical systems."

The case $n=p+1$ turns out to be especially interesting for the following reason: Up to conjugacy there is exactly one order $p$ element in $\text{Out}(F_{p+1})$ which does not lift to an order $p$ element in $\text{Aut}(F_{p+1})$. We compute the rational cohomology of the centraliser of this element and as a consequence obtain a full calculation of the $p$-adic Farrell--Tate $K$-theory of $\text{Out}(F_{p+1})$ for any prime $p \geq 5$. Our arguments provide an infinite family of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ summands in $K^1(B \text{Out}(F_n)) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q}$, with no need for computer calculations: the first such summand is in $K^1(B \text{Out}(F_{12})) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q}$."
2505.21802,On General Principal Symmetric Ideals,['math.AC'],['Noah Walker'],"In a recent paper by Harada, Seceleanu, and Şega, the Hilbert function, betti table, and graded minimal free resolution of a general principal symmetric ideal are determined when the number of variables in the polynomial ring is sufficiently large. In this paper, we strengthen that result by giving a effective bound on the number of variables needed for their conclusion to hold. The bound is related to a well-known integer sequence involving partition numbers (OEIS A000070). Along the way, we prove a recognition theorem for principal symmetric ideals. We also introduce the class of maximal $r$-generated submodules, determine their structure, and connect them to general symmetric ideals."
2505.21799,PolarGrad: A Class of Matrix-Gradient Optimizers from a Unifying Preconditioning Perspective,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']","['Tim Tsz-Kit Lau', 'Qi Long', 'Weijie Su']","The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and datasets underscores the critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing ""matrix-aware"" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon."

Previously it was unknown if for such a 3-manifold an ideal triangulation in which a fiber spun-normalizes exists. We give a proof of existence and give an algorithm to construct the ideal triangulation provided the 3-manifold has a single boundary component."

Here by a ""generalized progression"" in a group $G$, we mean a finite subset of $G$ built from a fixed set of generators in analogy to a (multidimensional) arithmetic progression of integers. These sets play an important role in additive combinatorics and, in particular, the study of approximate groups. Our two main results establish finite upper bounds on the VC-dimension of certain set systems of generalized progressions in finitely generated free groups and also the Heisenberg group over $\mathbb{Z}$."
2505.21787,Optimal Pricing Strategies for Heterogeneous Customers in Dual-Channel Closed-Loop Supply Chains: A Modeling Approach,"['math.OC', 'econ.TH']","['Yang Xiao', 'Hisashi Kurata', 'Ting Wang']","Dual-channel closed-loop supply chains (DCCLSCs) play a vital role in attaining both sustainability and profitability. This paper introduces a game-theoretic model to analyze optimal pricing strategies for primary and replacement customers within three distinct recycling frameworks: manufacturer-led, retailer-led, and collaborative recycling. The model identifies equilibrium pricing and subsidy decisions for each scenario, considering the primary customer's preference for the direct channel and the specific roles in recycling. The findings indicate that manufacturers tend to set lower prices in direct channels compared to retailers, aiming to stimulate demand and promote trade-ins. Manufacturer-led recycling initiatives result in stable pricing, whereas retailer-led recycling necessitates higher subsidies. Collaborative recycling strategies yield lower prices and an increase in trade-ins. Primary customers' preference for the direct channel significantly impacts pricing strategies, with a stronger preference leading to lower direct-channel prices and higher manufacturer subsidies. This paper contributes to the field by incorporating primary customer channel preferences and diverse recycling frameworks into DCCLSC pricing models. These insights assist manufacturers and retailers in adjusting pricing strategies and trade-in incentives according to primary customer preferences and associated costs, thereby enhancing profitability and recycling efficiency within DCCLSCs."

Mena', 'Arno Siri-Jégousse', 'Gabor Toth']","The Curie-Weiss model is used to study phase transitions in statistical mechanics and has been the object of rigorous analysis in mathematical physics. We analyse the problem of reconstructing the probability measure of a multi-group Curie-Weiss model from a sample of data by employing the maximum likelihood estimator for the coupling parameters of the model, under the assumption that there is interaction within each group but not across group boundaries. The estimator has a number of positive properties, such as consistency, asymptotic normality, and exponentially decaying probabilities of large deviations of the estimator with respect to the true parameter value. A shortcoming in practice is the necessity to calculate the partition function of the Curie-Weiss model, which scales exponentially with respect to the population size. There are a number of applications of the estimator in political science, sociology, and automated voting, centred on the idea of identifying the degree of social cohesion in a population. In these applications, the coupling parameter is a natural way to quantify social cohesion. We treat the estimation of the optimal weights in a two-tier voting system, which requires the estimation of the coupling parameter."
2505.21776,Finite Element Methods for Elastic Contact: Penalty and Nitsche,['math.NA'],"['Tom Gustafsson', 'Rolf Stenberg']",We consider two methods for treating elastic contact problems with the finite element method; the penalty method and Nitsche's method. For the penalty method we discuss how the penalty parameter should be chosen. Both the theoretical analysis and numerical examples show that an optimal convergence rate cannot be achieved. The method is contrasted to that of Nitsche which is optimally convergent. We also give the derivation of Nitsche's method by a very simple consistency correction of the penalty method.

In particular, we monitor the vertices for which the friendship-bias is positive, neutral and negative, respectively. For an arbitrary finite tree, we show that the number of positive vertices is at least as large as the number of negative vertices, a property we refer to as significance, and derive a lower bound in terms of the branching points in the tree. For an infinite Galton-Watson tree, we compute the densities of the positive and the negative vertices and show that either may dominate the other, depending on the offspring distribution. We also compute the densities of the edges having two given types of vertices at their ends, and give conditions in terms of the offspring distribution under which these types are positively or negatively correlated."

To address this, the paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing the impact of large-scale EV integration on distribution networks. Using the open-source simulator OpenDSS, the framework builds detailed, scalable models of electric distribution systems, incorporating high-fidelity synthetic data from the SMART-DS project. The study models three feeders from an urban substation in San Francisco down to the household level. A key contribution is the framework's ability to identify critical system components likely to require upgrades due to increased EV loads. It also incorporates advanced geospatial visualization through QGIS, which aids in understanding how charging demands affect specific grid areas, helping stakeholders target infrastructure reinforcements. To ensure realistic load modeling, the framework uses EV load profiles based on U.S. Department of Energy projections, factoring in vehicle types, charging behaviors, usage patterns, and adoption rates. By leveraging large-scale synthetic data, the model remains relevant for real-world utility planning. It supports diverse simulation scenarios, from light to heavy EV charging loads and distributed vs. centralized charging patterns, offering a practical planning tool for utilities and policymakers. Additionally, its modular design enables easy adaptation to different geographic regions, feeder setups, and adoption scenarios, making it suitable for future studies on evolving grid conditions."
2505.21770,Gradient-flow SDEs have unique transient population dynamics,"['math.PR', 'math.ST', 'stat.ML']","['Vincent Guan', 'Joseph Janssen', 'Nicolas Lanzetti', 'Antonio Terpin', 'Geoffrey Schiebinger', 'Elina Robeva']","Identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its population dynamics is a notoriously challenging task. Researchers in machine learning and single cell biology have only been able to prove a partial identifiability result: for potential-driven SDEs, the gradient-flow drift can be identified from temporal marginals if the Brownian diffusivity is already known. Existing methods therefore assume that the diffusivity is known a priori, despite it being unknown in practice. We dispel the need for this assumption by providing a complete characterization of identifiability: the gradient-flow drift and Brownian diffusivity are jointly identifiable from temporal marginals if and only if the process is observed outside of equilibrium. Given this fundamental result, we propose nn-APPEX, the first Schrödinger Bridge-based inference method that can simultaneously learn the drift and diffusion of gradient-flow SDEs solely from observed marginals. Extensive numerical experiments show that nn-APPEX's ability to adjust its diffusion estimate enables accurate inference, while previous Schrödinger Bridge methods obtain biased drift estimates due to their assumed, and likely incorrect, diffusion."
2505.21768,Dynamics of screened particles towards equi-spaced ground states,['math.FA'],"['Lucia De Luca', 'Michael Goldman', 'Marcello Ponsiglione']","This paper deals with the dynamics - driven by the gradient flow of negative fractional seminorms - of empirical measures towards equi-spaced ground states.
  Specifically, we consider periodic empirical measures $μ$ on the real line that are screened by the Lebesgue measure, i.e., with $μ-d x$ having zero average. To each of these measures $μ$ we associate a {(periodic)} function $u$ satisfying $u'= d x - μ$. For $s\in (0,\frac 12)$ we introduce energy functionals $\mathcal E^s(μ)$ that can be understood as the density of the $s$-Gagliardo seminorm of $u$ per unit length. Since for $s\ge \frac 12$, the $s$-Gagliardo seminorms are infinite on functions with jumps, some regularization procedure is needed: For $s\in[\frac 12,1)$ we define $\mathcal E_\e^s(μ):= \mathcal E^s(μ_\e)$, where $μ_\varepsilon$ is obtained by mollifying $μ$ on scale $\varepsilon$.
  We prove that the minimizers of $\mathcal E^s$ and $\mathcal E_\varepsilon^s$ are the equi-spaced configurations of particles with lattice spacing equal to one. Then, we prove the exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient flows to the equi-spaced steady states. Finally, although for $s\in[\frac 12 ,1)$ the energy functionals $\mathcal E_\varepsilon^s$ blow up as $\varepsilon\to 0$, their gradients are uniformly bounded (with respect to $\varepsilon$), so that the corresponding trajectories converge, as $\varepsilon\to 0$, to the gradient flow solution of a suitable renormalized energy."

This type of construction is used to improve upon the inclusions $L^{p_Φ}\cap L^{q_Φ}\subseteq L^Φ\subseteq L^{p_Φ} + L^{q_Φ}$. For trace type Orlicz spaces $L^{Φ,Φ}$, we find that when $Φ\in Δ_2$, we have $L^{Φ,Φ} \subseteq L^Φ$ if and only if $Φ(||f||_{L^Φ}) \le C ρ_Φ(f)$ for all $f\in L^Φ$, and the reverse inclusion is equivalent to the reversed inequality."

Moreover, à la Bochner, when the bound is an equality, special constraints are imposed on the manifold. We show that the distributional category of a space also bounds the rank of the Gottlieb group, with equality imposing constraints on the fundamental group. These bounds are refined in the setting of cohomologically symplectic manifolds, enabling us to get specific computations for the distributional category and LS-category."

Formally, we expect solutions subjected to subharmonic perturbations to converge to solutions subjected to localized perturbations as $n$ tends to infinity since larger $n$ values force the subharmonic perturbation to become more localized. In this paper, we study the convergence of solutions to linear initial value problems when subjected to subharmonic and localized perturbations. In particular, we prove the formal intuition outlined above; namely, we prove that if the subharmonic initial data converges to some localized initial datum, then the linear solutions converge."

Key to their proof is the notion of voracious projection of an element $g \in W$, which is used iteratively to construct a biautomatic structure for $W$: the voracious language. In this article, we generalize these two notions by defining them for any Garside shadow $B$ in a Coxeter system $(W,S)$. This leads to the result that any finite Garside shadow in $(W,S)$ can be used to construct a biautomatic structure for $W$. In addition, we show that for the Garside shadow $L$ of low elements, the biautomatic structure obtained corresponds to the original voracious language of Osajda and Przytycki. These results answer a question of Hohlweg and Parkinson."

The Lie algebra $W_n := W_n(\mathbb K)$ admits a natural grading $W_n = \bigoplus_{i \ge -1} W^{[i]}_n$, where $W^{[i]}_n$ consists of all homogeneous derivations whose coefficients are homogeneous polynomials of degree $i+1$ or zero. The component $W^{[0]}_n$ is a subalgebra of $W_n$ and is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb K).$ Moreover, each $W_n^{[i]}$ for $i \ge -1$ is a finite-dimensional module over $W_n^{[0]}$. We prove that $W^{[i]}_n,\; i \ge 0$ is a sum of two irreducible submodules $W^{[i]}_n = M_i \oplus N_i$, where $M_i$ consists of all divergence-free derivations, and $N_i$ consists of derivations that are polynomial multiples of the Euler derivation $E_n = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$. As a consequence, we show that the standard grading is exact in certain sense, namely: $[W^{[i]}_n, W^{[j]}_n] = W^{[i+j]}_n$ for all $i,j,$ except when $i = j = 0$. We also address the question of when the subalgebra of $W_n$ generated by $W_n^{[-1]} \oplus W_n^{[0]},$ together with an additional element from $W_n,$ equals the entire Lie algebra $W_n$."
2505.21705,Preconditioning transformations of adjoint systems for evolution equations,"['math.OC', 'math.NA']","['Brian K. Tran', 'Ben S. Southworth', 'Hannah F. Blumhoefer', 'Samuel Olivier']","Achieving robust control and optimization in high-fidelity physics simulations is extremely challenging, especially for evolutionary systems whose solutions span vast scales across space, time, and physical variables. In conjunction with gradient-based methods, adjoint systems are widely used in the optimization of systems subject to differential equation constraints. In optimization, gradient-based methods are often transformed using suitable preconditioners to accelerate the convergence of the optimization algorithm. Inspired by preconditioned gradient descent methods, we introduce a framework for the preconditioning of adjoint systems associated to evolution equations, which allows one to reshape the dynamics of the adjoint system. We develop two classes of adjoint preconditioning transformations: those that transform both the state dynamics and the adjoint equation and those that transform only the adjoint equation while leaving the state dynamics invariant. Both classes of transformations have the flexibility to include generally nonlinear state-dependent transformations. Using techniques from symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics, we further show that these preconditioned adjoint systems preserve the property that the adjoint system backpropagates the derivative of an objective function. We then apply this framework to the setting of coupled evolution equations, where we develop a notion of scale preconditioning of the adjoint equations when the state dynamics exhibit large scale-separation. We demonstrate the proposed scale preconditioning on an inverse problem for the radiation diffusion equations. Naive gradient descent is unstable for any practical gradient descent step size, whereas our proposed scale-preconditioned adjoint descent converges in 10-15 gradient-based optimization iterations, with highly accurate reproduction of the wavefront at the final time."

In this paper, we present a bisection variant of it by showing that if $G$ has minimum degree at least $k$, then $G$ has a balanced bipartite subgraph with at least $m/2+Ω(m^{(2k+1)/(2k+2)})$ edges. It not only answers a problem of Fan, Hou and Yu in full generality but also enhances a recent result given by Hou, Wu and Zhong.

Our main contribution is a sharp geometric characterization that identifies the directions of the cost vector that matter for optimality, relative to the task constraints and uncertainty set. We further develop a practical algorithm that, for a given task, constructs a minimal or least-costly sufficient dataset.

Thus, it comes to no surprise that these has been a central role in improving energy efficiency for private and public energy suppliers alike around the globe. Many studies have previously investigated the potential of energy saving by low temperature operation of the DHN and the integration of renewable energies. Many other studies consider this problem in terms of mixed integer lin-ear programming. Here, we instead investigate the utilization of well-established continuous optimization methods to improve DHN operation efficiency. We demonstrate that optimal control is able to model low temperature operation of a DHN for savings of around 8%, but can even further improve its operation when considering dynamic energy pricing, reducing the cost of operation by roughly 12%. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in a realistic, openly available network in Switzerland (OpenDHN), with a total runtime of less than 5 minutes on a standard desktop com-puter per experiment."

The first is an affine invariant, while the second is invariant under similarities of $\mathbb{R}^2$, and their analogue for $\mathbb{C}^2$. When the curve has no smooth components, these invariants are always finite and bounded. We illustrate our results by computing the range of possible values for these invariants for Arnold's ${\cal K}$-simple singularities.

For antibalanced signed graphs, we prove that $χ_c^g(G,σ)$ does not exceed the chromatic number of $G$ plus one, with tightness demonstrated for odd cycles. A dichotomy emerges for bipartite graphs: $χ_c^g(G,σ)$ equals $2$ when the graph is balanced, and otherwise remains bounded above by $3$. These results rely on switching equivalence principles (Lemma \ref{lem:Zaslavsky}) and critical properties of fundamental cycles (Lemma \ref{lem:ForcingTree}), adapting classical techniques from unsigned graph theory to the signed context. We further highlight open questions regarding computational complexity and planar graph extensions, creating new bridges between combinatorial game theory and signed graph structural analysis."

2505.21466,On the Modulation of Wave Trains in the Ostrovsky Equation,"['math.AP', 'math-ph']","['Mathew A. Johnson', 'Jeffrey Oregero', 'Wesley R. Perkins']","We consider the nonlinear wave modulation of arbitrary amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Ostrovsky equation, which arises as a model for the unidirectional propagation of small-amplitude, weakly nonlinear surface and internal gravity waves in a rotating fluid of finite depth. While the modulation of such waves with asymptotically small amplitudes of oscillation (the so-called Stokes waves) has been studied in several works, our goal is to understand the modulational dynamics of general amplitude wave trains. To this end, we first use Whitham's theory of modulations to derive a dispersionless system of quasilinear partial differential equations that is expected to model the slow evolution of the fundamental characteristics of a given wave train. In practice, the modulational stability or instability of a given wave train is considered to be determined by the hyperbolicity or ellipticity, respectively, of the resulting system of Whitham modulation equations. Using rigorous spectral perturbation theory we then study the spectral (linearized) stability problem for a given wave train solution of the Ostrovsky equation, directly connecting the hyperbolicity or ellipticity of the associated Whitham system to the rigorous spectral stability problem for the underlying wave. Specifically, we prove that strict hyperbolicity of the Whitham system implies spectral stability near the origin in the spectral plane, i.e. so-called spectral modulational stability, while ellipticity implies spectral instability of the underlying wave train."

The main parameter of interest in this game is the \textit{cop number}, which is the minimum number of cops that are sufficient to guarantee the capture of the robber.
  In a directed graph $\overrightarrow{G}$, the \textit{push} operation on a vertex $v$ reverses the orientation of all arcs incident on $v$. We consider a variation of classical \textsc{Cops and Robber} on oriented graphs, where in its turn, each cop can either move to an out-neighbor of its current vertex or push some vertex of the graph, whereas, the robber can move to an adjacent vertex in its turn. [Das et al., CALDAM, 2023] introduced this variant and established that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a subcubic graph, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy. We extend these results to establish that if $\overrightarrow{G}$ is an orientation of a $3$-degenerate graph, or of a graph with maximum degree $4$, then one cop with push ability has a winning strategy."

Global representations assemble into an abelian category $\mathsf{A}(\mathscr{U})$, simultaneously generalising classical representation theory and the category of VI-modules appearing in the representation theory of the general linear groups. In this paper we establish homological foundations of its derived category $\mathsf{D}(\mathscr{U})$. We prove that any complex of projective global representations is DG-projective, and hence conclude that the derived category admits an explicit model as the homotopy category of projective global representations. We show that from a tensor-triangular perspective it exhibits some unusual features: for example, there are very few dualizable objects and in general many more compact objects. Under more restrictive conditions on the family $\mathscr{U}$, we then construct torsion-free classes for global representations which encode certain growth properties in $\mathscr{U}$. This lays the foundations for a detailed study of the tensor-triangular geometry of derived global representations which we pursue in forthcoming work."

2505.21394,Dual Averaging Converges for Nonconvex Smooth Stochastic Optimization,['math.OC'],"['Tuo Liu', 'El Mehdi Saad', 'Wojciech Kotłowski', 'Francesco Orabona']","Dual averaging and gradient descent with their stochastic variants stand as the two canonical recipe books for first-order optimization: Every modern variant can be viewed as a descendant of one or the other. In the convex regime, these algorithms have been deeply studied, and we know that they are essentially equivalent in terms of theoretical guarantees. On the other hand, in the non-convex setting, the situation is drastically different: While we know that SGD can minimize the gradient of non-convex smooth functions, no finite-time complexity guarantee for Stochastic Dual Averaging (SDA) was known in the same setting. In this paper, we close this gap by a reduction that views SDA as SGD applied to a sequence of implicitly regularized objectives. We show that a tuned SDA exhibits a rate of convergence $\mathcal{O}(1 / T + σ\log T/ \sqrt{T})$, similar to that of SGD under the same assumptions. To our best knowledge, this is the first complete convergence theory for dual averaging on non-convex smooth stochastic problems without restrictive assumptions, closing a long-standing open problem in the field. Beyond the base algorithm, we also discuss ADA-DA, a variant that marries SDA with AdaGrad's auto-scaling, which achieves the same rate without requiring knowledge of the noise variance."

The propagation of electromagnetic waves in such time-varying dielectric media is governed by Maxwell's equations, which lead to wave equations with temporal highly oscillatory coefficients for the electric and magnetic fields. In this study, we analyze the effective behavior of electromagnetic fields in time-varying metamaterials using a formal two-scale asymptotic expansion. We provide a mathematical derivation of the effective equations for the leading-order homogenized solution, as well as for the first- and second-order corrections of the effective solution. While the effective solution and the first-order correction are governed by local material laws, we reveal a nonlocal constitutive relation for the second-order corrections. Special attention is also paid to temporal interface conditions through initial values of the homogenized equations. The results provide a mathematically justified framework for the effective description of wave-type equations of time-varying media, applicable to models in optics, elasticity, and acoustics."

2505.21350,Optimal Structure of Signal Networks for Efficient Information Aggregation,['math.PR'],"['Bernd Heidergott', 'Frank den Hollander', 'Ines Lindner', 'Azadeh Parvaneh']","This paper develops a mathematical framework to study signal networks, in which nodes can be active or inactive, and their activation or deactivation is driven by external signals and the states of the nodes to which they are connected via links. The focus is on determining the optimal number of key nodes (= highly connected and structurally important nodes) required to represent the global activation state of the network accurately. Motivated by neuroscience, medical science, and social science examples, we describe the node dynamics as a continuous-time inhomogeneous Markov process. Under mean-field and homogeneity assumptions, appropriate for large scale-free and disassortative signal networks, we derive differential equations characterising the global activation behaviour and compute the expected hitting time to network triggering. Analytical and numerical results show that two or three key nodes are typically sufficient to approximate the overall network state well, balancing sensitivity and robustness. Our findings provide insight into how natural systems can efficiently aggregate information by exploiting minimal structural components."

We discuss the existence and uniqueness of this causal factorization and link it to the canonical representation of Gaussian processes. As a byproduct, we characterize mean-square continuous Gaussian Volterra processes in terms of their natural filtrations. Moreover, for real-valued fractional stochastic differential equations, we show that the synchronous coupling between the driving fractional noises attains the adapted Wasserstein distance under some monotonicity conditions. Our results cover a wide class of stochastic processes which are neither Markov processes nor semi-martingales, including fractional Brownian motions and fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes."

Within this framework, we examine the Levi-Civita connection and null geodesics."

2505.21306,Structure-biased Maker-Breaker Games,['math.CO'],"['Wesley Pegden', 'Francesca Yu']","In classical Maker-Breaker games on graphs, Maker and Breaker take turns claiming edges; Maker's goal is to claim all of some structure (e.g., a spanning tree, Hamilton cycle, etc.), while Breaker aims to stop her. The standard question considered is how powerful a Breaker Maker can defeat; i.e., for the $(1:b)$-biased game where Breaker takes $b$ edges per turn, how large can $b$ be for Maker to still have a winning strategy, for various possible goal sets?
  We introduce a variant of this question in which Breaker is required to choose their multiple edges as the edges of (a subgraph of) a given structure (e.g., a matching, clique, etc.) on each turn. We establish the order of magnitude of the threshold biases for triangle games, connectivity games, and Hamiltonicity games under clique, matching, and star biases respectively. We conclude that in many cases structure imposes major obstruction to Breaker, opening up a set of games whose strategies deviate from the classical biased Maker-Breaker game strategies, and shedding light on the types of Breaker strategies that may or may not work to prove tighter bounds in the classical setting."
2505.21299,On Distinguishing Graphs and Cost Number using Automorphism Representations,"['math.CO', 'math.GR']","['Alexa Gopaulsingh', 'Zalán Molnár', 'Amitayu Banerjee']","A distinguishing coloring of a graph is a vertex coloring such that only the identity automorphism of the graph preserves the coloring. A 2-distinguishable graph is a graph which can be distinguished using 2 colors. The cost $ρ(G)$ of a 2-distinguishable graph is the smallest size of a color set of a distinguishing coloring of $G$. The determining number of a graph, $Det(G)$, is the minimum number of nodes, which if fixed by a coloring, would ensure that the coloring distinguishes the entire graph.
  Boutin (J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 85: 161-171, 2013) posed an open problem which asks if $ρ(G)$ and $Det(G)$ can be arbitrarily far apart. It is trivial that it cannot be so for the case $Det(G) = 1$ but the answer was unknown for $Det(G) \geq 2$. We solve this problem for the case $Det(G) = 2$. We show that for the case $Det(G) = 2$, that not only is the cost bounded but in fact it takes small values with $ρ(G) = 2, \ 3$ or $4$. In order to establish this, the concept of the automorphism representation of a graph is developed. Graphs having equivalent automorphism representations implies that they have the same distinguishing number (note that just having isomorphic automorphism groups is not enough for this to hold). This prompts a factoring of graphs by which two graphs are distinguishably equivalent iff they have equivalent automorphism representations."

In view of numerical simulations, these equations need to be discretized. In this article, we are interested in a discretization of the \acrshort{ipt}-\acrshort{dmft} functional equations, based on the restriction of the hybridization function and local self-energy to a finite number of points in the upper half-plane $\left(iω_n\right)_{n \in |[0,N_ω]|}$, where $ω_n=(2n+1)π/ β$ is the $n$-th Matsubara frequency and $N_ω\in \mathbb N$. We first prove the existence of solutions to the discretized equations in some parameter range depending on $N_ω$. We then prove uniqueness for a smaller range of parameters. We also study more in depth the case of bipartite systems exhibiting particle-hole symmetry. In this case, the discretized IPT-DMFT equations have purely imaginary solutions, which can be obtained by solving a real algebraic system of $(N_ω+1)$ equations with $(N_ω+1)$ variables. We provide a complete characterization of the solutions for $N_ω=0$ and some results for $N_ω=1$ in the simple case of the Hubbard dimer.

If so, is it equal (up to a constant) to $\varphi_H$? (2) When is $L(G)$ a factor? We give a complete answer to (1), and when $G$ is second countable, $G_1 := \text{ker}Δ_G$ is open in $G$ (called almost unimodular) and admits a sufficiently large non-unimodular part, we provide an answer to (2).

2505.21232,Solving a linear program via a single unconstrained minimization,['math.OC'],"['Adilet Otemissov', 'Alina Abdikarimova']","This paper proposes a novel approach for solving linear programs. We reformulate a primal-dual linear program as an unconstrained minimization of a convex and twice continuously differentiable merit function. When the optimal set of the primal-dual pair is nonempty, its optimal set is equal to the optimal set of the proposed merit function. Minimizing this merit function poses some challenges due to its Hessian being singular at some points in the domain, including the optimal solutions. We handle singular Hessians using the Newton method with Levenberg-Marquardt regularization. We show that the Newton method with Levenberg-Marquardt regularization yields global convergence to a solution of the primal-dual linear program in at most $O(ε^{-3/2})$ iterations requiring only the assumption that the optimal set of the primal-dual linear program is bounded. Testing on random synthetic problems demonstrates convergence to optimal solutions to very high accuracy significantly faster than the derived worst-case bound. We further introduce a modified merit function that depends on a scalar parameter $ν> 0$, whose Hessian is nonsingular for all $ν> 0$ and which reduces exactly to the original merit function when $ν= 0$. Based on this formulation, we propose a heuristic scheme that performs Newton steps while gradually decreasing $ν$ toward zero. Numerical experiments indicate that this approach achieves faster convergence, particularly on higher-dimensional problems."

As a first step in this direction, we show that a finite group cannot be covered by (proper) Sylow normalizers for distinct primes. Then, we settle the conjecture in two opposite situations: symmetric groups of large degree and metanilpotent groups of odd order. Applications concerning the intersection of nilpotent subgroups are discussed."

These supCAR fields possess infinitely divisible marginal distributions. Their second-order properties are characterised by a novel family of covariance functions which can exhibit short- and long-range spatial dependencies. First, the existence of such fields is examined. Then, functional limit theorems for supCAR fields are derived under general assumptions. Four limiting scenarios that depend on the marginals of the underlying autoregressive fields and the specifications of the superposition are identified. Examples of specific supCAR fields, for which the assumptions and results are provided in simple, explicit forms, are presented. The obtained limit theorems can be employed for the statistical inference of supCAR fields."

2505.21159,Imaginary modules arising from tensor products of snake modules,"['math.RT', 'math.QA']","['Matheus Brito', 'Adriano Moura']","Motivated by the limitations of cluster algebra techniques in detecting imaginary modules, we build on the representation-theoretic framework developed by the first author and Chari to extend the construction of such modules beyond previously known cases, which arise from the tensor product of a higher-order Kirillov--Reshetikhin module and its dual. Our first main result gives an explicit description of the socle of tensor products of two snake modules, assuming the corresponding snakes form a covering pair of ladders. By considering a higher-order generalization of the covering relation, we describe a sequence of inclusions of highest-$\ell$-weight submodules of such tensor products. We conjecture all the quotients of subsequent modules in this chain of inclusions are simple and imaginary, except for the socle itself, which might be real. We prove the first such quotient is indeed simple and, assuming an extra mild condition, we also prove it is imaginary, thus giving rise to new classes of imaginary modules within the category of finite-dimensional representations of quantum loop algebras in type A."
2505.21150,"Vanishing, Unbounded and Angular Shifts on the Quotient of the Difference and the Derivative of a Meromorphic Function",['math.CV'],"['Lasse Asikainen', 'Yu Chen', 'Risto Korhonen']","We show that for a vanishing period difference operator of a meromorphic function \( f \), there exist the following estimates regarding proximity functions, \[ \lim_{η\to 0} m_η\left(r, \frac{Δ_ηf - aη}{f' - a} \right) = 0 \] and \[ \lim_{r \to \infty} m_η\left(r, \frac{Δ_ηf - aη}{f' - a} \right) = 0, \] where \( Δ_ηf = f(z + η) - f(z) \), and \( |η| \) is less than an arbitrarily small quantity \( α(r) \) in the second limit. Then, under certain assumptions on the growth, restrictions on the period tending to infinity, and on the value distribution of a meromorphic function \( f(z) \), we have \[ m\left(r, \frac{Δ_ωf - aω}{f' - a} \right) = S(r, f'), \] as \( r \to \infty \), outside an exceptional set of finite logarithmic measure.
  Additionally, we provide an estimate for the angular shift under certain conditions on the shift and the growth. That is, the following Nevanlinna proximity function satisfies \[ m\left(r, \frac{f(e^{iω(r)}z) - f(z)}{f'} \right) = S(r, f), \] outside an exceptional set of finite logarithmic measure.
  Furthermore, the above estimates yield additional applications, including deficiency relations between \( Δ_ηf \) (or \( Δ_ωf \)) and \( f' \), as well as connections between \( η/ω\)-separated pair indices and \( δ(0, f') \)."
2505.21145,On endomorphisms of varieties which are injective on open subsets,['math.AG'],['Takumi Asano'],"We consider conditions under which endomorphisms of varieties become automorphisms. For example, there is a remarkable theorem, called Ax-Grothendieck theorem, which states that any injective endomorphism of a variety is bijective. Over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, bijectivity of endomorphisms of varieties implies that the endomorphisms are automorphisms, thus Ax-Grothendieck theorem gives one of the conditions we considering. There is also a conjecture, called Miyanishi conjecture, which claims that for any endomorphism of a variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, if it is injective outside a closed subset of codimension at least $2$, then it is an automorphism. Recently, I. Biswas and N. Das prove that any endomorphism which satisfies the conditions of Miyanishi conjecture induces an automorphism of the singular locus of the variety with some conditions. In this paper, we prove that Miyanishi conjecture holds for any threefold which satisfies the conditions of I. Biswas and N. Das. For higher dimensional varieties, we also observe how divisorial contractions affect endomorphisms by using minimal model program theory. We can prove that Miyanishi conjecture holds for any open subset of a projective variety which has a sequence of divisorial contractions to the canonical model or a birationally superrigid Mori fiber space."

Here, we investigate these measure-preserving dynamical systems under the extra assumption on the groups to be branch. First, we compute their $f$-invariant, a measure-conjugacy invariant introduced by Bowen, and show that they are Markov processes over free semigroups in the sense of Bowen. Secondly, we show that fractal branch profinite groups with the same Hausdorff dimension and whose associated measure-preserving dynamical systems have the same $f$-invariant yield isomorphic Markov processes."

We rule out two specific cases: when $π_1(X)$ is virtually cyclic and when $X$ is a Riemannian surface. More specifically, we show that if $X$ is a compact polyhedron with a virtually cyclic fundamental group, then its 1-Uryson width is bounded by the 1-Uryson width of its universal cover $\widetilde{X}$. Precisely: $$\mathrm{UW}_1(X) \leq 6 \cdot \mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X}).$$ We show that if $X$ is a Riemannian surface with boundary then $$\mathrm{UW}_1(X) \leq \mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X}).$$ Furthermore, we show that if there exist spaces $X$ for which $\mathrm{UW}_1(\widetilde{X})$ is bounded while $\mathrm{UW}_1(X)$ is arbitrarily large, then such examples must already appear in low dimensions. In particular, such $X$ can be found among Riemannian $2$-complexes."

The distance between two solutions is measured by their relative entropy, which to our knowledge was never used before in stability estimates. The logarithm of the strong solution is required to have polynomial growth while the weak solution can be any H-solution with sufficiently many moments at initial time. Since we require a substantial amount of regularity on the strong solution, we also provide an example of sufficient conditions on the initial data that ensure this regularity in the Coulomb (and very soft potentials) case."

These flows have no perfect fits and are thus quasigeodesic. In addition, our flows admit positive Birkhoff sections, which we argue implies that they give rise to $n$ universally tight contact structures whose lifts to any finite cover are non-contactomorphic. This argument involves cylindrical contact homology together with the work of Barthelmé, Frankel, and Mann on the reconstruction of pseudo-Anosov flows from their closed orbits.

Specifically, we construct a new family of prior distributions whose optimal Bayesian estimators (the conditional medians) can be any prescribed increasing function that satisfies certain regularity conditions. In the case of affine estimators, this family is distinct from the usual conjugate priors, which are gamma distributions. Our prior distributions are constructed through a limiting process that matches certain moment conditions. These results provide the first explicit description of a family of distributions, beyond the conjugate priors, that satisfy the affine conditional median property; and more broadly for the Poisson noise model they can give any arbitrarily prescribed conditional median."
2505.21098,Yet Another Distributional Bellman Equation,"['math.OC', 'math.PR']","['Nicole Bäuerle', 'Tamara Göll', 'Anna Jaśkiewicz']","We consider non-standard Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) where the target function is not only a simple expectation of the accumulated reward. Instead, we consider rather general functionals of the joint distribution of terminal state and accumulated reward which have to be optimized. For finite state and compact action space, we show how to solve these problems by defining a lifted MDP whose state space is the space of distributions over the true states of the process. We derive a Bellman equation in this setting, which can be considered as a distributional Bellman equation. Well-known cases like the standard MDP and quantile MDPs are shown to be special examples of our framework. We also apply our model to a variant of an optimal transport problem."
2505.21090,Residual Finiteness Growth in Two-Step Nilpotent Groups,['math.GR'],"['Jonas Deré', 'Joren Matthys']","Given a finitely generated residually finite group $G$, the residual finiteness growth $\text{RF}_G: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ bounds the size of a finite group $Q$ needed to detect an element of norm at most $r$. More specifically, if $g\in G$ is a non-trivial element with $\|g\|_G \leq r$, so $g$ can be written as a product of at most $r$ generators or their inverses, then we can find a homomorphism $φ: G \to Q$ with $φ(g) \neq e_Q$ and $|Q| \leq \text{RF}_G(r)$. The residual finiteness growth is defined as the smallest function with this property. This function has been bounded from above and below for several classes of groups, including virtually abelian, nilpotent, linear and free groups.
  However, for many of these groups, the exact asymptotics of $\text{RF}_G$ are unknown (in particular this is the case for a general nilpotent group), nor whether it is a quasi-isometric invariant for certain classes of groups. In this paper, we make a first step in giving an affirmative answer to the latter question for $2$-step nilpotent groups, by improving the polylogarithmic upper bound known in literature, and to show that it only depends on the complex Mal'cev completion of the group. If the commutator subgroup is one- or two-dimensional, we prove that our bound is in fact exact, and we conjecture that this holds in general."

A mathematical framework has been developed to analyze the synchronization of fast variables across heterogeneous systems, deriving a sufficient condition for the synchronization error to fall below a specified threshold within the minimum linger time. This condition accounts for coupling strength, heterogeneity, and time-scale separation, ensuring stable oscillatory behavior in the network. The result, supported by rigorous mathematical analysis, advances the understanding of synchronization in complex multi-time-scale systems."

We classify the asymptotic boundary components of these translators under suitable continuity assumptions. Specifically, we prove that if a boundary component lies in the vertical asymptotic boundary, it is of the form $\{p\}\times [T,\infty)$ or $\{p\}\times \mathbb R$, while if it lies in the horizontal asymptotic boundary, it is a complete geodesic. Our approach is inspired by earlier work on minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces in $\mathbb H^2\times\mathbb R$, with a key ingredient being the use of symmetric translators as barriers."

2505.21071,Dual Hierarchical Least-Squares Programming with Equality Constraints,['math.OC'],['Kai Pfeiffer'],"Hierarchical least-squares programming (HLSP) is an important tool in optimization as it enables the stacking of any number of priority levels in order to reflect complex constraint relationships, for example in physical systems like robots. Existing solvers typically address the primal formulation of HLSP's, which is computationally efficient due to sequential treatment of the priority levels. This way, already identified active constraints can be eliminated after each priority level, leading to smaller problems as the solver progresses through the hierarchy. However, this sequential progression makes the solvers discontinuous and therefore not differentiable. This prevents the incorporation of HLSP's as neural network neurons, or solving HLSP's in a distributed fashion. In this work, an efficient solver based on the dual formulation of HLSP's with equality constraints (D-HLSP-E) is developed. D-HLSP-E is a convex and differentiable quadratically constrained least-squares program (QCLSP), which is solved by an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). By introducing appropriate operator splitting, primal-dual variables, which link each priority level with all their respective higher priority levels, can be eliminated from the main computation step of computing a matrix factorization. The proposed solver D-HADM is about one magnitude faster than a comparable D-HLSP-E solver based on the interior-point method (D-HIPM), where the primal-dual variables enter the computational complexity in a cubic fashion."
2505.21038,Fixed-Point Traps and Identity Emergence in Educational Feedback Systems,['math.GM'],['Faruk Alpay'],"This paper presents a formal categorical proof that exam-driven educational systems obstruct identity emergence and block creative convergence. Using the framework of Alpay Algebra II and III, we define Exam-Grade Collapse Systems (EGCS) as functorial constructs where learning dynamics $\varphi$ are recursively collapsed by evaluative morphisms $E$. We prove that under such collapse regimes, no nontrivial fixed-point algebra $μ_\varphi$ can exist, hence learner identity cannot stabilize. This creates a universal fixed-point trap: all generative functors are entropically folded before symbolic emergence occurs. Our model mathematically explains the creativity suppression, research stagnation, and structural entropy loss induced by timed exams and grade-based feedback. The results apply category theory to expose why modern educational systems prevent φ-emergence and block observer-invariant self-formation. This work provides the first provable algebraic obstruction of identity formation caused by institutional feedback mechanics."
2505.21037,Factorization of positive definite kernels. Correspondences: $C^{*}$-algebraic and operator valued context vs scalar valued kernels,"['math.OA', 'math-ph', 'math.FA']","['Palle E. T.

These kernels encode operator-valued correlations governed by the algebraic structure of $\mathfrak{A}$, and generalize classical scalar-valued positive definite kernels, completely positive (CP) maps, and states on $C^{*}$-algebras. Our approach is based on a scalar-valued kernel $\tilde{K}\colon(X\times\mathfrak{A}\times H)^{2}\to\mathbb{C}$ associated to $K$, which defines a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and enables a concrete, representation-theoretic analysis of the structure of such kernels. We show that every $K\in\mathcal{M}$ admits a Stinespring-type factorization $K(s,t)(a)=V(s)^{*}π(a)V(t)$. In analogy with the Radon--Nikodym theory for CP maps, we characterize kernel domination $K\leq L$ in terms of a positive operator $A\inπ_{L}(\mathfrak{A})'$ satisfying $K(s,t)(a)=V_{L}(s)^{*}π_{L}(a)AV_{L}(t)$. We further show that when $π_{L}$ is irreducible, domination implies scalar proportionality, thus recovering the classical correspondence between pure states and irreducible representations."

We establish that the Ore extension $R[x;σ,δ]$ satisfies the rank condition if and only if $R$ does. In addition, we prove analogous results for the right and left strong rank conditions. However, in the right case, the ``if"" part requires the hypothesis that $σ$ is an automorphism, whereas, in the left case, this assumption is needed for the ``only if"" part. Finally, we provide a new proof of an old result of Susan Montgomery stating that a skew power series ring is directly (respectively, stably) finite if and only if its coefficient ring is directly (respectively, stably) finite."

Using their specific abilities, algebraic, geometric, dynamic, we conjecture interesting properties of the offsets. For a given progenitor (the given plane curve whose offsets are studied), changes in the offset distance induce great changes in the shape and the topology of the offset. Such a study has been performed in the past for classical curves, and recently for non classical ones.Here we relate to Cayley ovals; despite them being non singular, their offsets have intriguing properties, cusps, and self-intersections. We begin with a short study of envelopes of families of circles with constant radius centered on the oval (these constructs are often studied together with offsets, but they are different objects). Then we study the offsets, which are defined as geometric loci. Both approaches are supported by the automated methods provided by the software."

In this paper, we first show that the two-block sPADMM algorithm can achieve an $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ non-ergodic convergence rate. Then we propose an accelerated sPADMM (AsPADMM) algorithm by introducing extrapolation techniques and incrementing penalty parameters. The proposed AsPADMM algorithm is proven to converge globally to an optimal solution with a non-ergodic convergence rate of $O(1/K)$. Furthermore, the AsPADMM can be extended and combined with the symmetric Gauss-Seidel decomposition to achieve an accelerated ADMM for multi-block problems. Finally, we apply the proposed AsPADMM to solving the multi-block subproblems in difference-of-convex algorithms for robust low-rank tensor completion problems and mixed sparse optimization problems. The numerical results suggest that the acceleration techniques bring about a notable improvement in the convergence speed."

We present wavelets on finite groups and analyze their similarity to classical wavelets. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions in the wavelet coefficients, the scattering transform is non-expansive, stable under deformations, preserves energy, equivariant with respect to left and right group translations, and, as depth increases, the scattering coefficients are less sensitive to group translations of the signal, all desirable properties of convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, we provide examples illustrating the application of the scattering transform to classify data with domains involving abelian and nonabelian groups."

A periodic tangle can be seen as the universal cover of a link in the solid torus, the thickened torus, or the three-torus, respectively. Our goal is to study equivalence relations of such periodic tangles. Since all finite covers of a link lift to the same periodic tangle, it is necessary to prove that isotopies between different finite covers are preserved. In this paper, we show that if two links have isotopic lifts in a common finite cover, then they are isotopic. To do so, we employ techniques from 3-manifold topology to study the complements of such links."

Unlike standard sampling-based methods, our idea consists of partitioning the uncertainty domain in a user-defined number of sets, enabling more flexibility in the trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that our approximated problem is feasible for the original stochastic program, in terms of chance constraint satisfaction. In addition, we perform a rigorous performance analysis, by quantifying the distance between the optimal values of the original and the approximated problem. We show that our approach is tractable for optimization problems that include model predictive control of piecewise affine systems, and we demonstrate the benefits of our approach, in terms of the trade-off between conservatism and computational complexity, on a numerical example."

The independence polynomial of $G$ is defined as $I_G(z)=a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2+\cdots+a_αz^α$, where $a_i$ is the number of independent sets in $G$ with cardinality $i$ and $α$ is the cardinality of a largest independent set in $G$, known as the independence number of $G$. Let $G^m$ denote the $m$-times lexicographic product of $G$ with itself. The independence attractor of $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{A}(G)$, is defined as $\mathcal{A}(G) = \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} \{z: I_{G^m}(z)=0\}$, where the limit is taken with respect to the Hausdorff metric on the space of all compact subsets of the plane. This paper deals with independence attractors that are topologically simple. It is shown that $\mathcal{A}(G)$ can never be a circle. If $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is a line segment then it is proved that the line segment is $[-\frac{4}{k}, 0]$ for some $k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4 \}$. Examples of graphs with independence number four are provided whose independence attractors are line segments."

Such a function may, for example, be a non-decaying solution of the equation, such as a dark soliton. By developing the energy method with correction terms, we prove that the Cauchy problem for perturbations around such an $L^\infty$ function is unconditionally locally well-posed in $ H^s(\mathbb{R}) $ for $ s>3/4 $. As a byproduct, we also establish local well-posedness in the Zhidkov space."

2505.20865,Some optimal control and shape optimisation problems for bulk-surface cooperative systems,"['math.AP', 'math.OC']","['Andrea Gentile', 'Idriss Mazari-Fouquer', 'Raphaël Prunier']","The goal of this paper is to address some optimal control and shape optimisation problems arising from bulk-surface cooperative systems. The basic model under consideration is the following: letting $Ω$ be a fixed domain, we assume that a population (with density $u$) lives inside $Ω$ and can access some resources $f$, while a second population (with density $v$) lives on the boundary $\partial Ω$ and can access other resources $g$. These two populations are coupled in a cooperative manner by a constant exchange rate at the boundary, leading to a non-standard PDE system that has already been studied in previous works by Bogosel, Giletti and Tellini, for its connection with road-field models. Building on the considerations of the aforementioned previous works, we have two main objectives here: first, investigate the question of optimal resources distribution inside the domain $Ω$ and on the surface $\partial Ω$, i.e. how to spread resources in order to guarantee an optimal survival of the two species. We establish rigid Talenti inequalities and comparison results when $Ω$ is a ball, extending in particular the results of J. J. Langford on symmetrisation for Neumann and Robin problems. Second, when the resources distribution $f$ and $g$ are constant, we provide a partial analysis of the natural shape optimisation problem: which shape $Ω$ maximises the survival rate of the two species? Namely, we show that in certain regimes there can be no optimal shape and, by computing second-order shape derivatives, we investigate the local optimality of the ball."

For $1<p<q<\infty$, $a(\cdot)\in C^{0,α}(Ω)$ ($0<α\le1$), and a symmetric, almost everywhere positive definite matrix weight $\M$ with $|\M(x)|\,|\M(x)^{-1}|\leΛ$ for some constant $Λ\ge 1$ and small $|\log \M|_{\mathrm{BMO}}$, we prove, for every $γ>1$, $$ (|\M F|^p+a(x)|\M F|^q)\in L^γ_{\mathrm{loc}} \;\Longrightarrow\; (|\M Du|^p+a(x)|\M Du|^q)\in L^γ_{\mathrm{loc}}. $$ Our argument combines a freezing of the logarithm of the matrix field, $\log \M$, with a fractional maximal-operator method governed by the Muckenhoupt-Wheeden $\mathcal{A}_{p,s}$ classes (where $1/s=1/p-α/(nq)$). This yields scale-invariant comparison and level-set estimates and precludes Lavrentiev gaps at the sharp threshold $q/p\le 1+α/n$. Our result recovers the identity case $\,\M\equiv {\rm I}_n\,$, i.e., the classical (unweighted) Calderón-Zygmund theory for double-phase problems."
2505.20852,Optimal control of a two-dimensional elliptic equation with exponential nonlinearity and Dirac measure data,['math.OC'],['Vu Huu Nhu'],"This work addresses an optimal control problem for a semilinear elliptic equation in two-dimensional space, characterized by an exponential nonlinearity and a singular source term. The source is modeled as a finite linear combination of Dirac measures concentrated at a fixed set of distinct points. The control variable is a finite-dimensional vector whose components represent the masses assigned to these point sources. 
  Due to the interplay between the exponential nonlinearity and the singular measure data, the state equation is generally ill-posed and admits a unique very weak solution only when the largest component of the control vector does not surpass a certain critical threshold. Consequently, the control-to-state operator might be continuously differentiable only on an open subset of the control space. 
  To derive first-order optimality conditions for the original problem, we introduce a family of regularized problems by imposing box constraints on the control variables. These constraints are chosen such that the admissible control sets of the regularized problems lie entirely within the open subset where the control-to-state operator is smooth. By analyzing the optimality systems associated with the regularized problems and passing to the limit, we obtain necessary optimality conditions for the original, unregularized problem."

It imposes $C^k$ continuity conditions at the interface of subdomains, ensuring smoothness across the global solution. Nonlinear PDEs are solved using Picard and Newton iterations, analogous to classical methods.

Additionally, first-order methods with clipping, such as Clip-SGD, exhibit stronger convergence guarantees than SGD under the $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness assumption, a property observed in many DL tasks. However, the high-probability convergence of Clip-SGD under both assumptions -- heavy-tailed noise and $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness -- has not been fully addressed in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by establishing the first high-probability convergence bounds for Clip-SGD applied to convex $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our analysis extends prior results by recovering known bounds for the deterministic case and the stochastic setting with $L_1 = 0$ as special cases. Notably, our rates avoid exponentially large factors and do not rely on restrictive sub-Gaussian noise assumptions, significantly broadening the applicability of gradient clipping."
2505.20811,Linear-Time Computation of the Frobenius Normal Form for Symmetric Toeplitz Matrices via Graph-Theoretic Decomposition,['math.CO'],"['Hojin Chu', 'Homoon Ryu']","We introduce a linear-time algorithm for computing the Frobenius normal form (FNF) of symmetric Toeplitz matrices by utilizing their inherent structural properties through a graph-theoretic approach. Previous results of the authors established that the FNF of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix is explicitly represented as a direct sum of symmetric irreducible Toeplitz matrices, each corresponding to connected components in an associated weighted Toeplitz graph. Conventional matrix decomposition algorithms, such as Storjohann's method (1998), typically have cubic-time complexity. Moreover, standard graph component identification algorithms, such as breadth-first or depth-first search, operate linearly with respect to vertices and edges, translating to quadratic-time complexity solely in terms of vertices for dense graphs like weighted Toeplitz graphs. Our method uniquely leverages the structural regularities of weighted Toeplitz graphs, achieving linear-time complexity strictly with respect to vertices through two novel reductions: the α-type reduction, which eliminates isolated vertices, and the β-type reduction, applying residue class contractions to achieve rapid structural simplifications while preserving component structure. These reductions facilitate an efficient recursive decomposition process that yields linear-time performance for both graph component identification and the resulting FNF computation. This work highlights how structured combinatorial representations can lead to significant computational gains in symbolic linear algebra."

This provides a general measure-theoretic study for the convergence of stochastic schemes in continuous time."

For a field $F$ containing a root of unity of order $p$, let $H^\bullet(F)=H^\bullet(F,\mathbb{F}_p)$ be the mod-$p$ Galois cohomology graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra of $F$. By the Norm Residue Theorem, $H^\bullet(F)$ is a purely quadratic graded-commutative algebra, and is therefore determined by the cup product $\cup\colon H^1(F)\times H^1(F)\to H^2(F)$. We prove that the class of all Galois cohomology algebras $H^\bullet(F)$ is cofinal in the class of all purely quadratic graded-commutative $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras $A_\bullet$, in the following sense: For every $A_\bullet$ there exists $F$ such that the bilinear map $A_1\times A_1\to A_2$, which determines $A_\bullet$, embeds in the cup product bilinear map $\cup\colon H^1(F)\times H^1(F)\to H^2(F)$. We further provide examples of $\mathbb{F}_p$-bilinear maps which are not realizable by fields $F$ in this way.

Therein, we provided a rigorous analysis of the boundary localization and surface resonance phenomena for both the total and scattered waves, achieved through carefully selected incident waves and tailored physical parameters of the elastic medium. In the present study, we focus on quasi-Minnaert resonances in the context of two-dimensional elastic wave scattering. Unlike the 3D case [13], the 2D setting introduces fundamental theoretical challenges stemming from (i) the intrinsic coupling between shear and compressional waves, and (ii) the complex spectral properties of the associated layer potential operators. By combining layer potential techniques with refined asymptotic analysis and strategically designed incident waves, we rigorously establish quasi-Minnaert resonances in both the internal and scattered fields. In addition, the associated stress concentration effects are quantitatively characterized. Notably, the boundary-localized nature of the scattered field reveals potential applications in near-cloaking (via wave manipulation around boundaries). Our results contribute to a more comprehensive framework for studying resonance behaviors in high-contrast elastic systems."

We address the simultaneous reconstruction of the faults, the jumps in displacement and traction fields across the faults, and the interfaces of layers using a single passive boundary measurement. This inverse problem is particularly challenging due to the discontinuities in both the displacement and traction fields across the faults and the inherent difficulty of establishing uniqueness results with limited measurement data. Under the assumptions that the Lamé parameters are piecewise constants within each layer, satisfying strong convexity conditions, and that the faults exhibit corner singularities, we establish local uniqueness identifiability results for both the interfaces and the faults, as well as the jumps across the faults. Furthermore, we derive global uniqueness results for reconstructing the interfaces, the faults, and the corresponding displacement and traction jumps in generic scenarios under a priori geometric information, where the faults are geometrically general and may be either open or closed."

We also introduce the definition of post-Novikov algebras and show that there is a close relationship between post-Novikov algebras and $\mathcal{O}$-operators of weight $λ$. The tensor form of extended $\mathcal{O}$-operators is also investigated which leads to the definition of extended Novikov Yang-Baxter equations, which is a generalization of the notion of Novikov Yang-Baxter equations.

While many mixed-precision algorithms have been developed for iterative sparse linear solvers, effectively leveraging half-precision (fp16) arithmetic remains challenging. This study introduces a novel nested Krylov approach that integrates the flexible GMRES and Richardson methods in a deeply nested structure, progressively reducing precision from double-precision to fp16 toward the innermost solver. To avoid meaningless computations beyond precision limits, the low-precision inner solvers perform only a few iterations per invocation, while the nested structure ensures their frequent execution. Numerical experiments show that using fp16 in the approach directly enhances solver performance without compromising convergence, achieving speedups of up to 1.65x and 2.42x over double-precision and double-single mixed-precision implementations, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms or matches other standard Krylov solvers, including restarted GMRES, CG, and BiCGStab methods."

Gleich']","Despite hundreds of papers on preconditioned linear systems of equations, there remains a significant lack of comprehensive performance benchmarks comparing various preconditioners for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) systems. In this paper, we present a comparative study of 79 matrices using a broad range of preconditioners. Specifically, we evaluate 10 widely used preconditoners across 108 configurations to assess their relative performance against using no preconditioner. Our focus is on preconditioners that are commonly used in practice, are available in major software packages, and can be utilized as black-box tools without requiring significant \textit{a priori} knowledge. In addition, we compare these against a selection of classical methods. We primarily compare them without regards to effort needed to compute the preconditioner. Our results show that symmetric positive definite systems are mostly likely to benefit from incomplete symmetric factorizations, such as incomplete Cholesky (IC). Multigrid methods occasionally do exceptionally well. Simple classical techniques, symmetric Gauss Seidel and symmetric SOR, are not productive. We find that including preconditioner construction costs significantly diminishes the advantages of iterative methods compared to direct solvers; although, tuned IC methods often still outperform direct methods. Additionally, ordering strategies such as approximate minimum degree significantly enhance IC effectiveness. We plan to expand the benchmark with larger matrices, additional solvers, and detailed metrics to provide actionable information on SPD preconditioning."

In high-dimensional settings, where the number of covariates increases with the sample size, it is well known that the eigenstructure of the sample covariance matrix is inconsistent. The inverse-Wishart prior, a standard choice for covariance estimation in Bayesian inference, also suffers from posterior inconsistency. To address the issue of eigenvalue dispersion in high-dimensional settings, the shrinkage inverse-Wishart (SIW) prior has recently been proposed. Despite its conceptual appeal and empirical success, the asymptotic justification for the SIW prior has remained limited. In this paper, we propose a generalized shrinkage inverse-Wishart (gSIW) prior for high-dimensional covariance modeling. By extending the SIW framework, the gSIW prior accommodates a broader class of prior distributions and facilitates the derivation of theoretical properties under specific parameter choices. In particular, under the spiked covariance assumption, we establish the asymptotic behavior of the posterior distribution for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors by directly evaluating the posterior expectations for two sets of parameter choices. This direct evaluation provides insights into the large-sample behavior of the posterior that cannot be obtained through general posterior asymptotic theorems. Finally, simulation studies illustrate that the proposed prior provides accurate estimation of the eigenstructure, particularly for spiked eigenvalues, achieving narrower credible intervals and higher coverage probabilities compared to existing methods. For spiked eigenvectors, the performance is generally comparable to that of competing approaches, including the sample covariance."

2505.20620,Links on incompressible surfaces and volumes,['math.GT'],['Corbin Reid'],"We consider volumes of two families of links that have been the focus of recent results on geometry, namely weakly generalised alternating (WGA) links and fully augmented links (FAL). Both have known lower bounds on hyperbolic volume in terms of their diagram combinatorics, but less is known about upper bounds. In fact, Kalfagianni and Purcell recently found a family of WGA knots on a compressible surface for which there can be no upper bounds on volume in terms of twist number. They asked if upper volume bounds always exist on incompressible surfaces. We show the answer is no: we find infinite families of WGA and FALs on incompressible surfaces with no upper bound on volume in terms of twist number."
2505.20618,Convergent Operator-Splitting Scheme for Viscosity Solutions: A Foundation for Learning Domain-to-Solution Maps,['math.NA'],['Po-Yi Wu'],"This work introduces and rigorously analyzes a novel operator-splitting finite element scheme for approximating viscosity solutions of a broad class of constrained second-order partial differential equations. By decoupling the primary PDE evolution from the enforcement of constraints, the proposed method combines a stabilized finite element method for spatial discretization with an efficient semi-implicit time-stepping strategy.
  The cornerstone of our analysis is a proof that the scheme satisfies a discrete comparison principle. We demonstrate that under a mild time-step restriction and with appropriate stabilization, the discrete operator yields an M-matrix, which is sufficient to guarantee the scheme's monotonicity and consequent $L^\infty$-stability. These properties -- consistency, stability, and monotonicity -- are shown to be sufficient to prove convergence of the numerical approximation to the unique viscosity solution within the celebrated Barles--Souganidis framework. For solutions with enhanced regularity, we further establish an optimal-order error estimate of $O(Δt + h^2)$.
  The rigorously established stability of the scheme provides a blueprint for a novel Physics-Constrained Neural Operator (PCNO) architecture. We prove that by emulating the scheme's structure, the PCNO can provably break the curse of dimensionality for the challenging class of domain-to-solution mapping problems with complex topological variations, a problem for which standard learning approaches often fail. Numerical experiments for both a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with state constraints and a controlled reaction-diffusion system are presented to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness."
2505.20607,Strong Low Degree Hardness for the Number Partitioning Problem,"['math.ST', 'cs.CC', 'cs.DS', 'math.PR']","['Rushil Mallarapu', 'Mark Sellke']","In the number partitioning problem (NPP) one aims to partition a given set of $N$ real numbers into two subsets with approximately equal sum. The NPP is a well-studied optimization problem and is famous for possessing a statistical-to-computational gap: when the $N$ numbers to be partitioned are i.i.d. standard gaussian, the optimal discrepancy is $2^{-Θ(N)}$ with high probability, but the best known polynomial-time algorithms only find solutions with a discrepancy of $2^{-Θ(\log^2 N)}$. This gap is a common feature in optimization problems over random combinatorial structures, and indicates the need for a study that goes beyond worst-case analysis.
  We provide evidence of a nearly tight algorithmic barrier for the number partitioning problem. Namely we consider the family of low coordinate degree algorithms (with randomized rounding into the Boolean cube), and show that degree $D$ algorithms fail to solve the NPP to accuracy beyond $2^{-\widetilde O(D)}$. According to the low degree heuristic, this suggests that simple brute-force search algorithms are nearly unimprovable, given any allotted runtime between polynomial and exponential in $N$. Our proof combines the isolation of solutions in the landscape with a conditional form of the overlap gap property: given a good solution to an NPP instance, slightly noising the NPP instance typically leaves no good solutions near the original one. In fact our analysis applies whenever the $N$ numbers to be partitioned are independent with uniformly bounded density."
2505.20604,Least Squares Model Reduction: A Two-Stage System-Theoretic Interpretation,"['math.OC', 'eess.SY']",['Alberto Padoan'],"Model reduction simplifies complex dynamical systems while preserving essential properties. This paper revisits a recently proposed system-theoretic framework for least squares moment matching. It interprets least squares model reduction in terms of two steps process: constructing a surrogate model to satisfy interpolation constraints, then projecting it onto a reduced-order space. Using tools from output regulation theory and Krylov projections, this approach provides a new view on classical methods. For illustration, we reexamine the least-squares model reduction method by Lucas and Smith, offering new insights into its structure."
2505.20602,Connecting randomized iterative methods with Krylov subspaces,['math.NA'],"['Yonghan Sun', 'Deren Han', 'Jiaxin Xie']","Randomized iterative methods, such as the randomized Kaczmarz method, have gained significant attention for solving large-scale linear systems due to their simplicity and efficiency. Meanwhile, Krylov subspace methods have emerged as a powerful class of algorithms, known for their robust theoretical foundations and rapid convergence properties. Despite the individual successes of these two paradigms, their underlying connection has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a unified framework that bridges randomized iterative methods and Krylov subspace techniques, supported by both rigorous theoretical analysis and practical implementation. The core idea is to formulate each iteration as an adaptively weighted linear combination of the sketched normal vector and previous iterates, with the weights optimally determined via a projection-based mechanism. This formulation not only reveals how subspace techniques can enhance the efficiency of randomized iterative methods, but also enables the design of a new class of iterative-sketching-based Krylov subspace algorithms. We prove that our method converges linearly in expectation and validate our findings with numerical experiments."

This generalizes a celebrated theorem of Brendle. We also prove that any steady gradient Ricci soliton asymptotic to a cylinder over the homogeneous lens space $\mathbb{S}^{2m+1}/\mathbb{Z}_k = L_{m,k}$, for $m \geq 1$ and $k \geq 3$, is a noncollapsed Appleton soliton on the complex line bundle $O(-k)$ over $\mathbb{CP}^m$. Specializing to dimension 4, we classify steady gradient Ricci soliton singularity models on smooth orbifolds with tangent flows at infinity of the form $(SU(2)/Γ) \times \mathbb{R}$."

Carrillo', 'Stefano Fronzoni', 'Yuji Nakatsukasa', 'Endre Süli']","We present a numerical method for the approximation of the inverse of the fractional Laplacian $(-Δ)^{s}$, based on its spectral definition, using rational functions to approximate the fractional power $A^{-s}$ of a matrix $A$, for $0<s<1$. The proposed numerical method is fast and accurate, benefiting from the fact that the matrix $A$ arises from a finite element approximation of the Laplacian $-Δ$, which makes it applicable to a wide range of domains with potentially irregular shapes. We make use of state-of-the-art software to compute the best rational approximation of a fractional power. We analyze the convergence rate of our method and validate our findings through a series of numerical experiments with a range of exponents $s \in (0,1)$. Additionally, we apply the proposed numerical method to different evolution problems that involve the fractional Laplacian through an interaction potential: the fractional porous medium equation and the fractional Keller-Segel equation. We then investigate the accuracy of the resulting numerical method, focusing in particular on the accurate reproduction of qualitative properties of the associated analytical solutions to these partial differential equations."

In this paper, we prove the conjecture by looking at the determinants of deleted Laplacian matrices. The proof uses a Laplace expansion method on a family of determinants to determine the underlying recursion this family satisfies and then uses routine linear algebra methods to obtain an exact Binet formula for the $n$-th term."
2505.20530,Values of generalized Liouville power series at algebraic numbers,['math.NT'],"['Yu. Bilu', 'D. Marques', 'C. G. Moreira']","For every positive integer $m$ LeVeque (1953) defined the $U_m$-numbers as the transcendental numbers that admit very good approximation by algebraic numbers of degree $m$, but not by those of smaller degree. In these terms, Mahler's $U$-numbers are the transcendental numbers which are $U_m$ for some $m$. In 1965 Mahler showed that (properly defined) lacunary power series with integers coefficients take $U$-values at algebraic numbers, unless the value is algebraic for an obvious reason. However, his argument does not specify to which $U_m$ the value belongs.
  In this article, we introduce the notion of generalized Liouville series, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for their values to be $U_m$. As an application, we show that a generalized Liouville series takes a $U_m$-value at a simple algebraic integer of degree $m$, unless the value is algebraic for an obvious reason. (An algebraic number $α$ is called simple if the number field $\mathbb Q(α)$ does not have a proper subfield other than $\mathbb Q$.)"

Such algorithms have been extensively studied and widely applied in modern computations for matrices with low displacement rank and more recently for low-rank approximation of matrices, even though they are known to fail on worst-case inputs in the latter application. We devise novel superfast algorithms that consistently produce accurate 1-norm estimates for real-world matrices and discuss some promising extensions of our surprisingly simple techniques. With further testing and refinement, our algorithms can potentially be adopted in practical computations."
2505.20497,Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Black-Box Distributive Expanded Groups,"['math.RA', 'cs.CC', 'cs.SC']",['Mikhail Anokhin'],"Let $Ω$ be a finite set of finitary operation symbols. An $Ω$-expanded group is a group (written additively and called the additive group of the $Ω$-expanded group) with an $Ω$-algebra structure. We use the black-box model of computation in $Ω$-expanded groups. In this model, elements of a finite $Ω$-expanded group $H$ are represented (not necessarily uniquely) by bit strings of the same length, say, $n$. Given representations of elements of $H$, equality testing and the fundamental operations of $H$ are performed by an oracle.
  Assume that $H$ is distributive, i.e., all its fundamental operations associated with nonnullary operation symbols in $Ω$ are distributive over addition. Suppose $s=(s_1,\dots,s_m)$ is a generating system of $H$. In this paper, we present probabilistic polynomial-time black-box $Ω$-expanded group algorithms for the following problems: (i) given $(1^n,s)$, construct a generating system of the additive group of $H$, (ii) given $(1^n,s,(t_1,\dots,t_k))$ with $t_1,\dots,t_k\in H$, find a generating system of the additive group of the ideal in $H$ generated by $\{t_1,\dots,t_k\}$, and (iii) given $(1^n,s)$, decide whether $H\in\mathfrak V$, where $\mathfrak V$ is an arbitrary finitely based variety of distributive $Ω$-expanded groups with nilpotent additive groups. The error probability of these algorithms is exponentially small in $n$. In particular, this can be applied to groups, rings, $R$-modules, and $R$-algebras, where $R$ is a fixed finitely generated commutative associative ring with $1$. Rings and $R$-algebras may be here with or without $1$, where $1$ is considered as a nullary fundamental operation."

We propose a simple Céa-type finite element projection in the linear case and prove its quasi-optimal convergence. Special emphasis is put on the formulation and treatment of appropriate boundary conditions. For the nonlinear case we present a formulation in two space dimensions and prove the existence of a solution. We propose a discretization that extends the linear case in Uzawa-fashion to the nonlinear case by an additional Poisson solver. Numerical results illustrate the performance and convergence of our schemes.

The latter condition is also known as $ν$-maldistribution, where $ν: \mathcal{P}(ω)\to \mathbb{R}$ is the $\{0,1\}$-valued submeasure defined by $ν(A)=1$ if and only if $A\notin \mathcal{I}$. It turns out that the meagerness of $\mathcal{I}$ is also equivalent to a technical condition given by Misik and Toth in [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 541 (2025), 128667]. Lastly, we show that the analogue of the first part holds replacing $ν$ with $\|\cdot\|_\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a lower semicontinuous submeasure."

The formula depends on arithmetic properties of $γ$, which uncovers new symmetries and clarifies previous results. The formulas are then used to study the Lu Qi-Keng problem. We produce sequences of rationals $γ_j \searrow 1$, where each $\mathbb{H}_{γ_j}$ has a Bergman kernel with zeros (while $\mathbb{H}_1$ is known to have a zero-free kernel), resolving an open question on this domain class."
2505.20484,Asymptotic Convergence Analysis of High-Order Proximal-Point Methods Beyond Sublinear Rates,['math.OC'],"['Masoud Ahookhosh', 'Alfredo Iusem', 'Alireza Kabgani', 'Felipe Lara']","This paper investigates the asymptotic convergence behavior of high-order proximal-point algorithms (HiPPA) toward global minimizers, extending the analysis beyond sublinear convergence rate results. Specifically, we consider the proximal operator of a lower semicontinuous function augmented with a $p$th-order regularization for $p>1$, and establish the convergence of HiPPA to a global minimizer with a particular focus on its convergence rate. To this end, we focus on minimizing the class of uniformly quasiconvex functions, including strongly convex, uniformly convex, and strongly quasiconvex functions as special cases. Our analysis reveals the following convergence behaviors of HiPPA when the uniform quasiconvexity modulus admits a power function of degree $q$ as a lower bound on an interval $\mathcal{I}$: (i) for $q\in (1,2]$ and $\mathcal{I}=[0,1)$, HiPPA exhibits local linear rate for $p\in (1,2)$; (ii) for $q=2$ and $\mathcal{I}=[0,\infty)$, HiPPA converges linearly for $p=2$; (iii) for $p=q>2$ and $\mathcal{I}=[0,\infty)$, HiPPA converges linearly; (iv) for $q\geq 2$ and $\mathcal{I}=[0,\infty)$, HiPPA achieves superlinear rate for $p>q$. Notably, to our knowledge, some of these results are novel, even in the context of strongly or uniformly convex functions, offering new insights into optimizing generalized convex problems."

This study introduces a Vehicle Routing and Appointment Scheduling Problem (VRASP) to simultaneously optimize caregiver routes and appointment times, minimizing costs while improving service quality. We first develop a deterministic VRASP model and then extend it to a stochastic version using sample average approximation to account for travel and service time uncertainty. A tailored Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) heuristic is proposed, combining regret-based insertion and Tabu Search to efficiently solve both problem variants. Computational experiments show that the stochastic model outperforms the deterministic approach, while VNS achieves near-optimal solutions for small instances and demonstrates superior scalability for larger problems compared to CPLEX. This work provides HHC providers with a practical decision-making tool to enhance operational efficiency under uncertainty."

We prove that a bounded central extension of a hierarchically hyperbolic group (HHG) is still a HHG; conversely if a central extension is a HHG, then the extension is bounded, and the quotient is commensurable to a HHG. Motivated by questions on hierarchical hyperbolicity of quotients of mapping class groups, we therefore consider the general problem of determining when a quotient of a bounded central extension is still bounded, which we prove to be equivalent to an extendability problem for quasihomomorphisms. Finally, we show that quotients of the 4-strands braid group by suitable powers of a pseudo-Anosov are HHG, and in fact bounded central extensions of some HHG. We also speculate on how to extend the previous result to all mapping class groups."

These combined-field-type BIE formulations rely exclusively on classical Helmholtz boundary operators, resulting in provably well-posed, frequency-robust, Fredholm second-kind BIEs. Notably, we prove that the proposed formulations are free from spurious resonances, while retaining the versatility of Helmholtz integral operators. The approach is based on the equivalence between the Maxwell PEC scattering problem and two independent vector Helmholtz boundary value problems for the electric and magnetic fields, with boundary conditions defined in terms of the Dirichlet and Neumann traces of the corresponding vector Helmholtz solutions. While certain aspects of this equivalence (for the electric field) have been previously exploited in the so-called field-only BIE formulations, we here rigorously establish and generalize the equivalence between Maxwell and Helmholtz problems for both fields. Finally, a variety of numerical examples highlights the robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach when combined with Density Interpolation-based Nyström methods and fast linear algebra solvers, implemented in the open-source Julia package Inti$.$jl."

To distinguish between integration of jumps in a forward- or Marcus-sense, we refer to these equations as forward- respectively Marcus-type rough backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs). We establish global well-posedness by proving global apriori bounds for solutions and employing fixed-point arguments locally. Furthermore, we lift the RBSDE solution and the driving rough noise to the space of decorated paths endowed with a Skorokhod-type metric and show stability of solutions with respect to perturbations of the rough noise. Finally, we prove well-posedness for a new class of backward doubly stochastic differential equations (BDSDEs), which are jointly driven by a Brownian martingale $B$ and an independent discontinuous stochastic process $L$ of finite $q$-variation. We explain, how our RBSDEs can be understood as conditional solutions to such BDSDEs, conditioned on the information generated by the path of $L$."

We give an algorithm that, given a finite collection of 1-periods, computes the space of all linear relations among them with algebraic coefficients. In particular, the algorithm decides whether a given 1-period is transcendental, and whether two 1-periods are equal. This resolves, in the case of 1-periods, a problem posed by Kontsevich and Zagier, asking for an algorithm to decide equality of periods. The algorithm builds on the work of Huber and Wüstholz, who showed that all linear relations among 1-periods arise from 1-motives; we make this perspective effective by reducing the problem to divisor arithmetic on curves and providing the theoretical foundations for a practical and fully explicit algorithm. To illustrate the broader applicability of our methods, we also give an algorithmic classification of autonomous first-order (non-linear) differential equations."
2505.20379,An Unconstrained Optimization Approach to Moment Fitting with Phase Type Distributions,"['math.OC', 'math.PR']","['Eliran Sherzer', 'Yehezkel Resheff', 'Miklos Telek']","Phase type (PH) distributions are widely used in modeling and simulation due to their generality and analytical properties. In such settings, it is often necessary to construct a PH distribution that aligns with real-world data by matching a set of prescribed moments. Existing approaches provide either exact closed-form solutions or iterative procedures that may yield exact or approximate results. However, these methods are limited to matching a small number of moments using PH distributions with a small number of phases, or are restricted to narrow subclasses within the PH family. We address the problem of approximately fitting a larger set of given moments using potentially large PH distributions. We introduce an optimization methodology that relies on a re-parametrization of the Markovian representation, formulated in a space that enables unconstrained optimization of the moment-matching objective. This reformulation allows us to scale to significantly larger PH distributions and capture higher moments. Results on a large and diverse set of moment targets show that the proposed method is, in the vast majority of cases, capable of fitting as many as 20 moments to PH distributions with as many as 100 phases, with small relative errors on the order of under 0.5% from each target. We further demonstrate an application of the optimization framework where we search for a PH distribution that conforms not only to a given set of moments but also to a given shape. Finally, we illustrate the practical utility of this approach through a queueing application, presenting a case study that examines the influence of the i^{th} moment of the inter-arrival and service time distributions on the steady-state probabilities of the GI/GI/1 queue length."

The system is a cascade connection of a 4-dimensional linear system (current controller, CC) followed by a two-dimensional nonlinear system (phase-locked loop, PLL). For the PLL, we construct a Lyapunov function via numerical approximation of its level curves. In combination with the quadratic Lyapunov function of the CC, it forms a vector Lyapunov function (VLF) for the overall system. A forward-invariant set of the VLF is found via numerical application of the comparison principle. By LaSalle's invariance principle, convergence to the origin is established."

The feedback gain is time-varying, bounded, and has a bounded derivative (both bounds are known). We investigate the asymptotic stability of this system under all admissible behaviors of the gain. Note that the situation is similar to the classical absolute stability problem of Lurie--Aizerman with two differences: linearity and derivative constraint. Our method of analysis is therefore inspired by the variational ideas of Pyatnitskii, Barabanov, Margaliot, and others developed for the absolute stability problem. We derive the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation for a function describing the ""most unstable"" of the possible portraits of the closed-loop system. A numerical method is proposed for solving the equation. Based on the solution, sufficient conditions are formulated for the asymptotic stability and instability. The method is applied to an equation arising from the analysis of a power electronics synchronization circuit."

We introduce the concept of intersection indicium as a generalization of the concept of ascending index introduced in [2] and prove some of its properties. We then establish the Inverse intersection indicium problem for number fields (excluding certain cases) which is a generalization of Inverse ascending index problem for number fields proved in [2]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [10] and generalize a result in [10] for number fields and also establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We generalize a result in [6] by establishing that a certain family of triplets is compositum feasible over any number field and we also list all the irreducible triplets in this family. We also prove a partial case of a conjecture in [6]. In the concluding section of this article, we improve on the inverse problems proved in [2] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions."
2505.20224,Triangular and Unitriangular Factorization of Twisted Chevalley Groups,"['math.GR', 'math.KT']","['Shripad M. Garge', 'Deep H. Makadiya']","The existence of triangular and unitriangular factorizations has been extensively studied for untwisted Chevalley groups, as well as for twisted Chevalley groups of types other than ${}^2A_{2n} \ (n \geq 1)$. However, the case of twisted Chevalley groups of type ${}^2A_{2n} \ (n \geq 1)$, has remained unresolved in the general setting of commutative rings. Prior work by A. Smolensky addressed this case only over certain fields, including finite fields and the field of complex numbers. These results indicate that, even over fields, the ${}^2A_{2n}$ case demands more refined techniques, reflecting the difficulty of extending such factorizations to the broader class of commutative rings.
  In this paper, we introduce two new classes of commutative rings: those satisfying the \emph{special stable range one condition} and those that are \emph{$θ$-complete}. We discuss their basic properties and provide illustrative examples. Our main result establishes the existence of triangular and unitriangular factorizations for twisted Chevalley groups of type ${}^2A_{2n}$ over a certain class of commutative rings, which includes all fields, all local rings (with mild restrictions), and several other important classes of rings."

This allows us to obtain abstract corona theorem for certain uniform algebras, asserting density of a specific Gleason part in the spectrum of an $H^\infty$ -- type subalgebra of $A^{**}$.
  There is an isometric isomorphism of the latter subalgebra with $H^\infty(G)$ for a wide class of domains $G\subset\mathbb C^d$. Using abstract corona theorem we show the density of the canonical image of $G$ in the spectrum of $H^\infty(G)$, solving positively corona problem for this class (which in particular includes balls and polydisks)."
2505.20219,New Perspectives on the Polyak Stepsize: Surrogate Functions and Negative Results,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']","['Francesco Orabona', ""Ryan D'Orazio""]","The Polyak stepsize has been proven to be a fundamental stepsize in convex optimization, giving near optimal gradient descent rates across a wide range of assumptions. The universality of the Polyak stepsize has also inspired many stochastic variants, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. Despite the many theoretical results, our understanding of the convergence properties and shortcomings of the Polyak stepsize or its variants is both incomplete and fractured across different analyses. We propose a new, unified, and simple perspective for the Polyak stepsize and its variants as gradient descent on a surrogate loss. We show that each variant is equivalent to minimize a surrogate function with stepsizes that adapt to a guaranteed local curvature. Our general surrogate loss perspective is then used to provide a unified analysis of existing variants across different assumptions. Moreover, we show a number of negative results proving that the non-convergence results in some of the upper bounds is indeed real."

Consider the initial-valued problem \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} & \partial_{t}\,u_ε\,=\,L_ε\,u_ε\;,\\ & u_ε(0,\,\cdot)=u_{0}(\cdot)\;, \end{aligned} \right.\end{equation*} for some bounded continuous function $u_{0}$. We prove the existence of time-scales $θ_ε^{(1)},\,\dots,\,θ_ε^{(\mathfrak{q})}$ such that $θ_ε^{(1)}\to\infty$, $θ_ε^{(p+1)}/θ_ε^{(p)}\to\infty$, $1\le p\le\mathfrak{q}-1$, probability measures $p(x,\cdot)$, $x\in R$, and kernels $R_{t}^{(p)}(m_j,m_k)$, where $\{m_j:j\in Z\}$ represents the set of stable equilibrium of the ODE $\dot{x}(t) = b(x(t))$ such that \begin{equation*} \lim_{ε\to0} u_ε(tθ_ε^{(p)}, x) \;=\;\sum_{j,k\in Z} p(x,m_j)\, R_{t}^{(p)} (m_j,m_k) \,u_{0}(m_k)\;, \end{equation*} for all $t>0$ and $x\in R$.

  The proof relies on the analysis of the diffusion $X_ε(\cdot)$ induced by the generator $L_ε$ based on the resolvent approach to metastability introduced in [21]."
2505.20210,A structure-preserving multiscale solver for particle-wave interaction in non-uniform magnetized plasmas,"['math.NA', 'physics.plasm-ph']","['Kun Huang', 'Irene M. Gamba', 'Chi-Wang Shu']","Particle-wave interaction is of fundamental interest in plasma physics, especially in the study of runaway electrons in magnetic confinement fusion. Analogous to the concept of photons and phonons, wave packets in plasma can also be treated as quasi-particles, called plasmons. To model the ``mixture"" of electrons and plasmons in plasma, a set of ``collisional"" kinetic equations has been derived, based on weak turbulence limit and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation.
  There are two main challenges in solving the electron-plasmon kinetic system numerically. Firstly, non-uniform plasma density and magnetic field results in high dimensionality and the presence of multiple time scales. Secondly, a physically reliable numerical solution requires a structure-preserving scheme that enforces the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.
  In this paper, we propose a struture-preserving multiscale solver for particle-wave interaction in non-uniform magnetized plasmas. The solver combines a conservative local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) scheme for the interaction part with a trajectory averaging method for the plasmon Hamiltonian flow part. Numerical examples for a non-uniform magnetized plasma in an infinitely long symmetric cylinder are presented. It is verified that the LDG scheme rigorously preserves all the conservation laws, and the trajectory averaging method significantly reduces the computational cost."

Daley', 'Yoni Nazarathy', 'Jiesen Wang']","The paper studies the counting process arising as a subset of births and deaths in a birth--death process on a finite state space. Whenever a birth or death occurs, the process is incremented or not depending on the outcome of an independent Bernoulli experiment whose probability is a state-dependent function of the birth and death and also depends on whether it is a birth or death that has occurred. We establish a formula for the asymptotic variance rate of this process, also presented as the ratio of the asymptotic variance and the asymptotic mean. Several examples including queueing models illustrate the scope of applicability of the results. An analogous formula for the countably infinite state space is conjectured and tested."

Our result includes widespread prior choices such as the popular Matérn processes, with the standard exponential (and sigmoid) link, and implies that the resulting methodologically attractive procedures optimally solve the statistical problem at hand, in the increasing domain asymptotics and under the common assumption in spatial statistics that the covariates are stationary and ergodic."
2505.20153,"Simple, Efficient Entropy Estimation using Harmonic Numbers",['math.ST'],['Octavio César Mesner'],"The estimation of entropy, a fundamental measure of uncertainty, is central to diverse data applications. For discrete random variables, however, efficient entropy estimation presents challenges, particularly when the cardinality of the support set is large relative to the available sample size. This is because, without other assumptions, there may be insufficient data to adequately characterize a probability mass function. Further complications stem from the dependence among transformations of empirical frequencies within the sample. This paper demonstrates that a simple entropy estimator based on the harmonic number function achieves asymptotic efficiency on discrete random variables with tail probabilities satisfying $p_j =o(j^{-2})$ as $j\rightarrow\infty$. This result renders statistical inference newly feasible for all but very heavy-tailed probability mass functions. Moreover, its strong mean squared error bounds coupled with simple implementation make this estimator an attractive replacement over others in application."

We introduce a version of the Rédei reciprocity law for function fields and use this to show existence of governing fields."
2505.20111,Preference Disaggregation Analysis with Criteria Selection in a Regularization Framework,['math.OC'],"['Kun Zhou', 'Zaiwu Gong', 'Guo Wei', 'Roman Slowinski']","Limited by cognitive abilities, decision-makers (DMs) may struggle to evaluate decision alternatives based on all criteria in multiple criteria decision-making problems. This paper proposes an embedded criteria selection method derived from preference disaggregation technique and regularization theory. The method aims to infer the criteria and value functions used by the DM to evaluate decision alternatives. It measures the quality of criteria subsets by investigating both the empirical error (fitting ability of value functions to preference information) and generalization error (complexity of value functions). Unlike existing approaches that consider only the deviation from linearity as a measure of complexity, we argue that the number of marginal value functions also affects complexity. To address this, we use 0-1 variables to indicate whether a criterion is selected in the value function or not, and construct a criteria selection model with the trade-off between empirical and generalization errors as the objective function. If the criteria are sufficiently discriminative, we identify all supporting criteria sets that can restore preference information without unnecessary criteria. We further analyze the likelihood of criteria being selected by the DM. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to an example of the green supplier selection problem."

To address this problem, we introduce a prescribed curvature flow-a discrete analogue of the Ricci flow on noncompact surfaces-specifically adapted to the setting of infinite cellular decompositions. We establish the well-posedness of the flow and prove two convergence results under certain conditions. Our approach resolves the prescribed total geodesic curvature problem for a broad class of surfaces with infinite cellular decompositions, yielding, in certain cases, smooth hyperbolic surfaces of infinite topological type with geodesic boundaries or cusps. Moreover, the proposed flow provides a method for constructing hyperbolic metrics from appropriate initial data."
2505.20090,On Model Predictive Funnel Control with Equilibrium Endpoint Constraints,['math.OC'],"['Jens Göbel', 'Dario Dennstädt', 'Lukas Lanza', 'Karl Worthmann', 'Thomas Berger', 'Tobias Damm']","We propose model predictive funnel control, a novel model predictive control (MPC) scheme building upon recent results in funnel control. The latter is a high-gain feedback methodology that achieves evolution of the measured output within predefined error margins. The proposed method dynamically optimizes a parameter-dependent error boundary in a receding-horizon manner, thereby combining prescribed error guarantees from funnel control with the predictive advantages of MPC. On the one hand, this approach promises faster optimization times due to a reduced number of decision variables, whose number does not depend on the horizon length. On the other hand, the continuous feedback law improves the robustness and also explicitly takes care of the inter-sampling behavior. We focus on proving stability by leveraging results from MPC stability theory with terminal equality constraints. Moreover, we rigorously show initial and recursive feasibility."

While the existence of global solutions (viscous Alfvén waves) on the whole space $\R^3$ was previously established in \cite{He-Xu-Yu}, such results cannot be expected for general finite periodic domains. We demonstrate that global solutions do exist on the torus $Q_L=[-L,L]^3$ precisely when the domain exceeds a size $L_μ>e^{\f1μ}$, providing the first quantitative characterization of the transition to infinite-domain-like behavior."

Devine', 'Seán McGarraghy']","This paper employs a game-theoretic approach to analyze investment decisions in Ireland's electricity market. It compares optimal electricity investment strategies among energy generators under a perfect competition framework with an imperfect Nash-Cournot competition. The model incorporates market price based on competition among generators while accounting for the supply capacity of each firm and each technology, along with the System Non-Synchronous Penetration (SNSP) constraint to reflect operational limitations in renewable energy contribution to the power system. Both models are formulated as single-objective function optimization problems. Furthermore, unit commitment constraints are introduced to the perfect competition model, allowing the model to incorporate binary decision variables to capture energy unit scheduling decisions of online status, startup, and shutdown costs. The proposed models are evaluated under three different demand test cases, using Ireland's electricity generation projections for 2023 to 2033. The results highlight key differences in investment decisions, carbon emissions, and the contribution of renewable technologies in perfect and imperfect competition structures. The findings provide managerial insights for policymakers and stakeholders, supporting optimal investment decisions and generation capacity planning to achieve Ireland's long-term energy objectives."

Next we discuss higher order multirate schemes that generalize classical singlerate linear multistep, Runge-Kutta, and extrapolation methods."
2505.20060,Area-charge inequality and local rigidity in charged initial data sets,"['math.DG', 'gr-qc']",['Abraão Mendes'],"This paper investigates the geometric consequences of equality in area-charge inequalities for spherical minimal surfaces and, more generally, for marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS), within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. We show that, under appropriate energy and curvature conditions, saturation of the inequality $\mathcal{A} \geq 4π(\mathcal{Q}_{\rm E}^2 + \mathcal{Q}_{\rm M}^2)$ imposes a rigid geometric structure in a neighborhood of the surface. In particular, the electric and magnetic fields must be normal to the foliation, and the local geometry is isometric to a Riemannian product. We establish two main rigidity theorems: one in the time-symmetric case and another for initial data sets that are not necessarily time-symmetric. In both cases, equality in the area-charge bound leads to a precise characterization of the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the initial data near the critical surface."

2505.20022,Kernel Ridge Regression with Predicted Feature Inputs and Applications to Factor-Based Nonparametric Regression,['math.ST'],"['Xin Bing', 'Xin He', 'Chao Wang']","Kernel methods, particularly kernel ridge regression (KRR), are time-proven, powerful nonparametric regression techniques known for their rich capacity, analytical simplicity, and computational tractability. The analysis of their predictive performance has received continuous attention for more than two decades. However, in many modern regression problems where the feature inputs used in KRR cannot be directly observed and must instead be inferred from other measurements, the theoretical foundations of KRR remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for analyzing KRR with predicted feature inputs. Our framework is not only essential for handling predicted feature inputs -- enabling us to derive risk bounds without imposing any assumptions on the error of the predicted feature -- but also strengthens existing analyses in the classical setting by allowing arbitrary model misspecification, requiring weaker conditions under the squared loss, particularly allowing both an unbounded response and an unbounded function class, and being flexible enough to accommodate other convex loss functions. We apply our general theory to factor-based nonparametric regression models and establish the minimax optimality of KRR when the feature inputs are predicted using principal component analysis. Our theoretical findings are further corroborated by simulation studies and real-data analyses using pretrained LLM embeddings for the downstream prediction task."
2505.20018,On the monoid of lexicographically minimal extensions,['math.CO'],"['Jonathan Caalim', 'Yu-ichi Tanaka']","A sequence $(e_i)_{i \le m}$ of nonnegative integers $e_i$, where $m \in \mathbb{N}$ or $m =\infty$, is called a binomid index if $\sum_{i=n-k+1}^{n} e_i\geq \sum_{i=1}^ke_i$ for all $k, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $ 1\le k \le n < m$. Infinite binomid indices give rise to binomid sequences (also known as Raney sequences) and generalized binomial coefficients. A finite binomid index $η$ can be extended to a unique lexicographically minimal infinite binomid index $\tildeη$. This lex-minimal extension $\tildeη$ is necessarily eventually periodic. In this research, we give a formula for the minimal period and provide an upper bound for the preperiod of $\tildeη$. We also show that the monoid of lex-minimal extensions is an inductive limit of finitely presented monoids."
2505.20008,Critical dynamical fluctuations in reaction-diffusion processes,"['math.PR', 'math-ph']","['Benoit Dagallier', 'Claudio Landim']","We consider a one-dimensional microscopic reaction-diffusion process obtained as a superposition of a Glauber and a Kawasaki dynamics. The reaction term is tuned so that a dynamical phase transition occurs in the model as a suitable parameter is varied. We study dynamical fluctuations of the density field at the critical point.
  We characterise the slowdown of the dynamics at criticality, and prove that this slowdown is induced by a single observable, the global density (or magnetisation). We show that magnetisation fluctuations are non-Gaussian and characterise their limit as the solution of a non-linear SDE. We prove, furthermore, that other observables remain fast: the density field acting on the fast modes (i.e. on mean-0 test functions) and with Gaussian scaling converges, in the sense of finite dimensional distributions, to a Gaussian field with space-time covariance that we compute explicitly.
  The proof relies on a decoupling of slow and fast modes relying in particular on a relative entropy argument. Major technical difficulties include the fact that local equilibrium does not hold due to the non-linearity, and proving replacement estimates on diverging time intervals due to critical slowdown."
2505.20005,Existence of the solution to the graphical lasso,"['math.ST', 'stat.ME']",['Jack Storror Carter'],The graphical lasso (glasso) is an $l_1$ penalised likelihood estimator for a Gaussian precision matrix. A benefit of the glasso is that it exists even when the sample covariance matrix is not positive definite but only positive semidefinite. This note collects a number of results concerning the existence of the glasso both when the penalty is applied to all entries of the precision matrix and when the penalty is only applied to the off-diagonals. New proofs are provided for these results which give insight into how the $l_1$ penalty achieves these existence properties. These proofs extend to a much larger class of penalty functions allowing one to easily determine if new penalised likelihood estimates exist for positive semidefinite sample covariance.
2505.19992,Robust feedback control of collisional plasma dynamics in presence of uncertainties,['math.NA'],"['Giacomo Albi', 'Giacomo Dimarco', 'Federica Ferrarese', 'Lorenzo Pareschi']","Magnetic fusion aims to confine high-temperature plasma within a device, enabling the fusion of deuterium and tritium nuclei to release energy. Due to the very large temperatures involved, it is essential to isolate the plasma from the device walls to prevent structural damage and the external magnetic fields play a fundamental role in achieving this confinement. In realistic settings, the physical mechanisms governing plasma behavior are highly complex, involving numerous uncertain parameters and intricate particle interactions, such as collisions, that significantly affect both confinement efficiency and overall stability. In this work, we address particularly these challenges by proposing a robust feedback control strategy designed to steer the plasma towards a desired spatial region, despite the presence of uncertainties. From a modeling perspective, we consider a collisional plasma described by a Vlasov-Poisson-BGK system, which accounts for a self-consistent electric field and a strong external magnetic field, while incorporating uncertainty in the model. A key feature of the proposed control strategy is its independence from the random parameter, making it particularly suitable for practical applications. A series of numerical simulations confirms the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrates the ability of external magnetic fields to successfully confine plasma away from the device boundaries, even in the presence of uncertain conditions."

Inspired by Ramanujan's classical congruences for the partition function $p(n)$, we establish a Ramanujan-type congruence for $C(n)$, proving that $C(5n+4) \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$. Further, we study the generating function $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty a(n)\, q^n = \frac{(-q; q)^2_\infty}{(q; q)_\infty}$, which arises naturally in this context, and provide multiple combinatorial interpretations for the sequence $a(n)$. We then offer a complete characterization of the values $a(n) \mod 2^m$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, 4$, highlighting their connection to generalized pentagonal numbers. Using computational methods and modular forms, we also derive new identities and congruences, including $a(7n+2) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, expanding the scope of partition congruences in arithmetic progressions. These results build upon classical techniques and recent computational advances, revealing deep combinatorial and modular structure within partition functions."
2505.19981,Non-strict singularity of optimal Sobolev embeddings,['math.FA'],"['Jan Lang', 'Zdeněk Mihula']","We investigate the operator-theoretic property of strict singularity for optimal Sobolev embeddings within the general framework of rearrangement-invariant function spaces (r.i. spaces).
  More specifically, we focus on studying the ``quality'' of non-compactness for optimal Sobolev embeddings $V^m_0X(Ω)\to Y_X(Ω)$, where $X$ is a given r.i. space and $Y_X$ is the corresponding optimal target r.i. space (i.e., the smallest among all r.i. spaces).
  For the class of sub-limiting norms (i.e., the norms whose fundamental function satisfies $\varphi_{Y_X}(t)\approx t^{-m/n}\varphi_X(t)$ as $t\to0^+$), we construct suitable spike-function sequences that establish a general framework for proving non-strict singularity of optimal (and thus non-compact) sublimiting Sobolev embeddings.
  As an application, we show that optimal sublimiting Sobolev embeddings are not strictly singular in a rather large subclass of r.i. spaces, namely weighted Lambda spaces $X=Λ^q_w$, $q\in[1, \infty)$. Except for the endpoint case $X=L^{n/m,1}$, our spike-function construction enables us to construct a subspace of $V^m_0X$ that is isomorphic to $\ell_q$, which we then leverage to prove the non-strict singularity of the corresponding optimal Sobolev embedding."
2505.19945,Signed Angle Rigid Graphs for Network Localization and Formation Control,"['math.OC', 'eess.SY']","['Jinpeng Huang', 'Gangshan Jing']","Graph rigidity theory studies the capability of a graph embedded in the Euclidean space to constrain its global geometric shape via local constraints among nodes and edges, and has been widely exploited in network localization and formation control. In recent years, the traditional rigidity theory has been extended by considering new types of local constraints such as bearing, angle, ratio of distance, etc. Among them, the signed angle constraint has received extensive attention, since it is practically measurable and independent of the global coordinate frame. However, the relevant studies always consider special graph structures, which are sufficient but not necessary for signed angle rigidity. This paper presents a comprehensive combinatorial analysis in terms of graphs and angle index sets for signed angle rigidity. We show that Laman graphs equivalently characterize minimally signed angle rigid graphs. Moreover, we propose a method to construct the minimal set of signed angle constraints in a Laman graph to effectively ensure signed angle rigidity. These results are finally applied to distributed network localization and formation stabilization problems, respectively, where each agent only has access to signed angle measurements."
2505.19936,Convergence rates for Tikhonov regularization on compact sets: application to neural networks,['math.NA'],"['Barbara Palumbo', 'Paolo Massa', 'Federico Benvenuto']","In this work, we consider ill-posed inverse problems in which the forward operator is continuous and weakly closed, and the sought solution belongs to a weakly closed constraint set. We propose a regularization method based on minimizing the Tikhonov functional on a sequence of compact sets which is dense in the intersection between the domain of the forward operator and the constraint set. The index of the compact sets can be interpreted as an additional regularization parameter. We prove that the proposed method is a regularization, achieving the same convergence rates as classical Tikhonov regularization and attaining the optimal convergence rate when the forward operator is linear. Moreover, we show that our methodology applies to the case where the constrained solution space is parametrized by means of neural networks (NNs), and the constraint is obtained by composing the last layer of the NN with a suitable activation function. In this case the dense compact sets are defined by taking a family of bounded weight NNs with increasing weight bound. Finally, we present some numerical experiments in the case of Computerized Tomography to compare the theoretical behavior of the reconstruction error with that obtained in a finite dimensional and non-asymptotic setting. The numerical tests also show that our NN-based regularization method is able to provide piece-wise constant solutions and to preserve the sharpness of edges, thus achieving lower reconstruction errors compared to the classical Tikhonov approach for the same level of noise in the data."
2505.19929,A Galerkin Alternating Projection Method for Kinetic Equations in the Diffusive Limit,['math.NA'],"['Gianluca Ceruti', 'Nicolas Crouseilles', 'Lukas Einkemmer']","The numerical approximation of high-dimensional evolution equations poses significant computational challenges, particularly in kinetic theory and radiative transfer. In this work, we introduce the Galerkin Alternating Projection (GAP) scheme, a novel integrator derived within the Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation (DLRA) framework. We perform a rigorous error analysis, establishing local and global accuracy using standard ODE techniques. Furthermore, we prove that GAP possesses the Asymptotic-Preserving (AP) property when applied to the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), ensuring consistent behavior across both kinetic and diffusive regimes. In the diffusive regime, the K-step of the GAP integrator directly becomes the limit equation. In particular, this means that we can easily obtain schemes that even in the diffusive regime are free of a CFL condition, do not require well prepared initial data, and can have arbitrary order in the diffusive limit (in contrast to the semi-implicit and implicit schemes available in the literature). Numerical experiments support the theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method."
2505.19921,Calabi-Yau property in derived Koszul calculus,['math.RT'],"['Roland Berger', 'Jun Maillard']",A Poincaré Van den Bergh duality theorem for strong Kc-Calabi-Yau algebras was obtained by R. Taillefer and the first author under the assumption that the derived functors of functors involved in the statement exist. We prove the existence of these derived functors by showing that the dg category defining the derived Koszul calculus is isomorphic to a dg category of dg modules over a dg algebra. Therefore we get a definition of strong Kc-Calabi-Yau algebras and a corresponding duality theorem without any existence assumption. We prove that a polynomial algebra is strong Kc-Calabi-Yau.

Taruni']","An $\textit{isometric path}$ is a shortest path between two vertices. An $\textit{isometric path partition}$ (IPP) of a graph $G$ is a set $I$ of vertex-disjoint isometric paths in $G$ that partition the vertices of $G$. The \textit{isometric path partition number} of $G$, denoted by $\text{ipp}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of an IPP of $G$. In this article, we prove that every graph $G$ satisfies $\text{ipp}(G) \leq |V(G)| - ν(G)$, where $ν(G)$ is matching number of $G$. We further prove that a connected graph $G$ is extremal with respect to this upper bound, i.e.\ satisfies $\text{ipp}(G) = |V(G)| - ν(G)$, if and only if either (i) all blocks of $G$ are odd complete graphs, or (ii) all blocks of $G$ except one are odd complete graphs, and the unique block $B$ of $G$ that is not an odd complete graph is even and satisfy $\text{ipp}(B) = |V(B)| - ν(B)$. As corollaries of this result, we obtain a full structural characterization of all connected odd graphs that are extremal with respect to our upper bound, as well as of all extremal block graphs."

After defining a superstack as a stack over the étale site of superschemes, we define quotient superstacks, and, based on previous literature, we see that, in analogy with superschemes, every superstack has an underlying ordinary stack, which we call its bosonic reduction. Then we progressively introduce more structure, considering algebraic superspaces, Deligne-Mumford superstacks and algebraic superstacks. We study the topology of algebraic superstacks and several properties of morphisms between them. We introduce quasi-coherent sheaves, and the sheaves of relative differentials. An important issue is how to check that an algebraic superstack is Deligne-Mumford, and we generalize to this setting the usual criteria in terms of the unramifiedness of the diagonal of the stack. Two appendices are devoted to collecting the basic definitions of group superschemes and principal superbundles, and to stating and analyzing some properties of morphisms of superschemes, that are at the basis of the study of morphisms of superstacks in the main text."

Also there is a countable, complete, discrete metric space whose free space does not embed into the free space of any uniformly discrete metric space. This enhanced diversity is a consequence of the fact that the dentability index $D$ presents a highly non-binary behavior when assigned to the free spaces of metric spaces outside of the oppressive confines of compact purely 1-unrectifiable spaces. Indeed, the cardinality of $\{D(\mathcal F(M)): M$ countable, complete, discrete$\}$ is uncountable while $\{D(\mathcal F(M)):M$ infinite, compact, purely 1-unrectifiable$\}=\{ω,ω^2\}$. Similar barrier is observed for uniformly discrete metric spaces as higher values of the dentability index are excluded for their free spaces: $\{D(\mathcal F(M)):M$ infinite, uniformly discrete$\}=\{ω^2,ω^3\}$."

We first develop the Brill-Noether theory on elliptic K3 surfaces via the notion of Bridgeland stability type for objects in their derived category. As a main application, we show that curves on elliptic K3 surfaces serve as the first known examples of smooth k-gonal curves which are general from the viewpoint of Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory. In particular, we provide new proofs of the main non-existence and existence results in Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory.

We consider the following decision problem: given a pathograph $\mathfrak{H}$ and a finite set of pathographs $\mathcal{F}$, is there an $\mathcal{F}$-free realization of $\mathfrak{H}$? This may be regarded as a generalization of the ""graph class containment problem"": given two graph classes $S$ and $S'$, is it the case that $S\subseteq S'$? We prove the pathograph realization problem is undecidable in general, but it is decidable in the case that $\mathfrak{H}$ has no rungs (but may have spokes), or if $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under adding edges, spokes, and rungs. We also discuss some potential applications to proving decomposition theorems."

In this article, we consider a thinner set than the set of $2$-almost primes, which is $$ \mathbb{P}^{(c)}=(\lfloor p^c \rfloor)_{p\in \mathbb{P}}\quad (c>0,c\notin \mathbb{N}), $$ where $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers and $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ is the floor function. We prove that for all $c \in (0,\frac{13}{15})$, any large enough integer $N$ can be represented as
  $$
  N=\lfloor p^c\rfloor+q,

  It is well known that the twin prime conjecture can be approached by a similar way to the Goldbach conjecture with a different form of the Chen's theorem. We also prove similar results due to the set $\mathbb{P}^{(c)}$ with both an unconditional case and an average case based on the Lebesgue measure, which also improve a theorem by Balog."
2505.19824,Weighted Tail Random Variable: A Novel Framework with Stochastic Properties and Applications,"['math.ST', 'stat.AP']","['Sarikul Islam', 'Nitin Gupta']","This paper introduces a novel framework to construct the probability density function (PDF) of non-negative continuous random variables. The proposed framework uses two functions: one is the survival function (SF) of a non-negative continuous random variable, and the other is a weight function, which is an increasing and differentiable function satisfying some properties. The resulting random variable is referred to as the weighted tail random variable (WTRV) corresponding to the given random variable and the weight function. We investigate several reliability properties of the WTRV and establish various stochastic orderings between a random variable and its WTRV, as well as between two WTRVs. Using this framework, we construct a WTRV of the Kumaraswamy distribution. We conduct goodness-of-fit tests for two real-world datasets, applied to the Kumaraswamy distribution and its corresponding WTRV. The test results indicate that the WTRV offers a superior fit compared to the Kumaraswamy distribution, which demonstrates the utility of the proposed framework."

Previously, the authors in \cite{L20,RZZ25} obtained the threshold $γ=1$ for $σ\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ satisfying a generic Diophantine condition, where they also proved $γ= 4/3$ for a general $σ\in\mathbb{R}$. In the present paper, we obtain the threshold $γ=1$ in $H^N(N>13/2)$, hence improving the above results when $σ$ is a rational number. The nonlinear inviscid damping for velocity $u^2_{\neq}$ is also established. Moreover, our result shows that the nonzero modes of magnetic field has an amplification of order $ν^{-1/3}$ even on low regularity, which is very different from the case considered in \cite{L20,RZZ25}."

This work introduces two novel adaptive mesh refinement algorithms, based on robust local error indicators, designed to solve the underlying energy minimization problem efficiently. A comprehensive convergence analysis is provided for minimizer sequences generated by these distinct adaptive strategies. It is rigorously demonstrated that sequences from the first algorithm converge to a prescribed tolerance. Notably, the second algorithm is proven to yield inherently convergent sequences without requiring an explicit stopping criterion. The practical efficacy of the proposed adaptive framework is validated through extensive numerical simulations, where critical comparisons of energy components (bulk, surface, and total) demonstrate the performance of the two adaptive algorithms in the case of an edge crack in a strain-limiting solid subjected to anti-plane shear-type loading."
2505.19796,A Topological Perspective on the Birch and Swinnerton Dyer Conjectures,['math.GM'],['Maisara Shoeib'],"This paper presents a topological framework for investigating the Birch and Swinnerton Dyer conjecture through four dimensional embeddings of elliptic curves. We propose a correspondence between the algebraic rank of an elliptic curve and the number of topologically independent loops in its embedding, which appears to be related to the order of vanishing of its L function at s=1. Our computational function F new and its generalization F_(m,s) provide methods for examining this relationship through asymptotic analysis. Examples with rank curves from 0 to 8 show patterns supporting this correspondence. The approach connects with established frameworks, including the Kolyvagin Flach machinery and the Gross Zagier formula, potentially offering new perspectives on this significant open problem in number theory."

In particular, we first focus our attention on the existence of stationary solutions with at most one zero inside the interval, studying their behavior with respect to the viscosity coefficient $\varepsilon>0$ and their stability/instability properties. Then, we investigate the large time behavior of the solutions for finite times and the asymptotic regime. We also show numerically that, for a particular class of initial data, the so-called metastable behavior occurs, meaning that the time-dependent solution persists for an exponentially long (with respect to $\varepsilon$) time in a transition non-stable phase, before converging to a stable configuration."

In our setting the population growth is governed by a generic growth rate function $b(t, N(t))$. The two main components of our model are the growth rate $b(t, N(t))$, as well as the opinions of the incoming agents which are modeled in our system as boundary conditions in a free boundary problem. We give results on the well-posedness of the model and results that showcase how these two components affect the long time asymptotic behavior of our system. Moreover, we provide a kinetic (probabilistic) description of our model and give results on well-posedness and asymptotics for the kinetic model."

Building upon the fixed-point emergence structures developed in Alpay Algebra I and II, this third installment formalizes the observer-coupled φ-collapse process through transfinite categorical flows and curvature-driven identity operators. We define a novel temporal drift mechanism as a recursive deformation of identity signatures under entangled observer influence, constructing categorical invariants that evolve across fold iterations. The proposed system surpasses conventional identity modeling in explainable AI (XAI) by encoding internal transformation history into a symbolic fixed-point structure, offering provable traceability and temporal coherence. Applications range from AI self-awareness architectures to formal logic systems where identity is not static but dynamically induced by observation. The theoretical results also offer a mathematically rigorous basis for future AI systems with stable self-referential behavior, positioning Alpay Algebra as a next-generation symbolic framework bridging category theory, identity logic, and observer dynamics."

To measure the singularity of interactions, we introduce a new probability distance induced by local integrable functions, and estimate this distance for the time-marginal laws of solutions by using the Wasserstein distance of initial distributions. A key point of the study is to characterize the path space of time-marginal distributions for the solutions, by using local hyperbound estimates on diffusion semigroups."

In this paper, we derive such formulas via an application of the periodic normalization method in combination with the functional analytic perturbation framework for dual semigroups (sun-star calculus). The explicit formulas allow us to distinguish between nondegenerate, sub- and supercritical bifurcations. To efficiently apply these formulas, we introduce the characteristic operator as this enables us to use robust numerical boundary-value algorithms based on orthogonal collocation. Although our theoretical results are proven in a more general setting, the software implementation and examples focus on discrete DDEs. The actual implementation is described in detail and its effectiveness is demonstrated on various models."

We examine several topological properties, such as connectedness, compactness, Lindelöfness, separability and second countability of this pseudometric space. We realise that the space is connected if and only if $μ$ is a non-atomic measure and we explicitly describe the components in $\mathcal{M}_δ$, for any choice of measure. We also deduce that $\mathcal{M}_δ$ is zero-dimensional if and only if $μ$ is purely atomic. We define $μ$ to be bounded away from zero, if every non-zero measurable set has measure greater than some constant. We establish several conditions equivalent to $μ$ being bounded away from zero. For instance, $μ$ is bounded away from zero if and only if $\mathcal{M}_δ$ is a locally compact space. We conclude this article by describing the structure of compact sets and Lindelöf sets in $\mathcal{M}_δ$."
2505.19765,On some coupled local and nonlocal diffusion models,"['math.NA', 'math.AP']","['Juan Pablo Borthagaray', 'Patrick Ciarlet Jr']","We study problems in which a local model is coupled with a nonlocal one. We propose two energies: both of them are based on the same classical weighted $H^1$-semi norm to model the local part, while two different weighted $H^s$-semi norms, with $s \in (0,1)$, are used to model the nonlocal part. The corresponding strong formulations are derived. In doing so, one needs to develop some technical tools, such as suitable integration by parts formulas for operators with variable diffusivity, and one also needs to study the mapping properties of the Neumann operators that arise. In contrast to problems coupling purely local models, in which one requires transmission conditions on the interface between the subdomains, the presence of a nonlocal operator may give rise to nonlocal fluxes. These nonlocal fluxes may enter the problem as a source term, thereby changing its structure. Finally, we focus on a specific problem, that we consider most relevant, and study regularity of solutions and finite element discretizations. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the most salient features of the models."

It is shown that the solutions converge to an equilibrium state exponentially in the $L^2$-norm provided the density is essentially uniform-in-time bounded from above. Moreover, we also obtain that the density and magnetic field converge to their equilibrium states exponentially in the $L^\infty$-norm if additionally the initial density is bounded away from zero. These greatly improve the previous work in (J. Differential Equations 288 (2021), 1-39), where the authors considered the torus case and required the $L^6$-norm of the magnetic field to be uniformly bounded as well as zero initial total momentum and an additional restriction $2μ>λ$ for the viscous coefficients. This paper provides the first global stability result for large strong solutions of compressible magnetohydrodynamic equations in 3D general bounded domains."

We introduce an adaptive wavelet-based algorithm that performs sequential prediction without prior knowledge of $(s,p,q)$, and establish minimax-optimal regret bounds against any comparator in $B\_{pq}^s$. We further design a locally adaptive extension capable of dynamically tracking spatially inhomogeneous smoothness. This adaptive mechanism adjusts the resolution of the predictions over both time and space, yielding refined regret bounds in terms of local regularity. Consequently, in heterogeneous environments, our adaptive guarantees can significantly surpass those obtained by standard global methods."

We apply the Michael-Simon-Sobolev inequality to establish new Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities on hypersurfaces. Based on these Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities, we apply local energy estimates to extend the solution by a covering argument and obtain an estimate on the maximal existence time of the biharmonic flow of hypersurfaces in higher dimensions. In particular, we solve a problem in \cite{BWW} on the biharmonic hypersurface flow for $n=4$. Finally, we apply our new approach to prove global existence of the Willmore flow in higher dimensions."

Under an assumption of weak stability of the constant states 0 and 1, and of existence of pulsating traveling fronts connecting them, we show that fronts' profiles appear, along sequences of times and points, in the large-time dynamics of the solutions of the Cauchy problem, whether their initial supports are bounded or unbounded. The types of equations that fit into our assumptions are the combustion and the bistable ones. We also show a generalized Freidlin-G{ä}rtner formula and other geometrical properties of the asymptotic invasion shapes, or spreading sets, of invading solutions, and we relate these sets to the upper level sets of the solutions."

The algorithm of interest consists of outer and inner iterations. We show that, under standard assumptions, the algorithm achieves local superlinear convergence by solving a linear system at each outer iteration, removing the need for further computations in the inner iterations. We also provide a specific update for the barrier parameters that achieves local near-quadratic convergence of the algorithm. We apply our results to the method proposed by Obara, Okuno, and Takeda (2025) and show its local superlinear and near-quadratic convergence with an analysis of the second-order stationarity. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for constrained optimization on Riemannian manifolds that achieves both local convergence and global convergence to a second-order stationary point."
2505.19720,A Structured Tour of Optimization with Finite Differences,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']","['Marco Rando', 'Cesare Molinari', 'Lorenzo Rosasco', 'Silvia Villa']","Finite-difference methods are widely used for zeroth-order optimization in settings where gradient information is unavailable or expensive to compute. These procedures mimic first-order strategies by approximating gradients through function evaluations along a set of random directions. From a theoretical perspective, recent studies indicate that imposing structure (such as orthogonality) on the chosen directions allows for the derivation of convergence rates comparable to those achieved with unstructured random directions (i.e., directions sampled independently from a distribution). Empirically, although structured directions are expected to enhance performance, they often introduce additional computational costs, which can limit their applicability in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we examine the impact of structured direction selection in finite-difference methods. We review and extend several strategies for constructing structured direction matrices and compare them with unstructured approaches in terms of computational cost, gradient approximation quality, and convergence behavior. Our evaluation spans both synthetic tasks and real-world applications such as adversarial perturbation. The results demonstrate that structured directions can be generated with computational costs comparable to unstructured ones while significantly improving gradient estimation accuracy and optimization performance."

2505.19705,Efficient globalization of heavy-ball type methods for unconstrained optimization based on curve searches,['math.OC'],"['Federica Donnini', 'Matteo Lapucci', 'Pierluigi Mansueto']","In this work, we deal with unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems. Specifically, we are interested in methods carrying out updates possibly along directions not of descent, like Polyak's heavy-ball algorithm. Instead of enforcing convergence properties through line searches and modifications of search direction when suitable safeguards are not satisfied, we propose a strategy based on searches along curve paths: a curve search starting from the first tentative update allows to smoothly revert towards a gradient-related direction if a sufficient decrease condition is not met. The resulting algorithm provably possesses global convergence guarantees, even with a nonmonotone decrease condition. While the presented framework is rather general, particularly of interest is the case of parabolic searches; in this case, under reasonable assumptions, the resulting algorithm can be shown to possess optimal worst case complexity bounds for reaching approximate stationarity in nonconvex settings. Practically, we show that the proposed globalization strategy allows to consistently accept (optimal) pure heavy-ball steps in the strongly convex case, while standard globalization approaches would at times negate them before even evaluating the objective function. Preliminary computational experiments also suggest that the proposed framework might be more convenient than classical safeguard based approaches."

2505.19703,Model Predictive Online Monitoring of Dynamical Systems for Nested Signal Temporal Logic Specifications,['math.OC'],"['Tao Han', 'Shaoyuan Li', 'Xiang Yin']","This paper investigates the online monitoring problem for cyber-physical systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. The objective is to design an online monitor that evaluates system correctness at runtime based on partial signal observations up to the current time so that alarms can be issued whenever the specification is violated or will inevitably be violated in the future. We consider a model-predictive setting where the system's dynamic model is available and can be leveraged to enhance monitoring accuracy. However, existing approaches are limited to a restricted class of STL formulae, permitting only a single application of temporal operators. This work addresses the challenge of nested temporal operators in the design of model-predictive monitors. Our method utilizes syntax tree structures to resolve dependencies between temporal operators and introduces the concept of basic satisfaction vectors. A new model-predictive monitoring algorithm is proposed by recursively updating these vectors online while incorporating pre-computed satisfaction regions derived from offline model analysis. We prove that the proposed approach is both sound and complete, ensuring no false alarms or missed alarms. Case studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

Such problems arise in a range of domains, including the identification of systems governed by Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (ODEs/PDEs), optimal control, and data assimilation. Their solution is complicated by the nonlinear nature of the underlying constraints and the instability introduced by noise. In this paper, we propose a homotopy based optimization method for solving such problems. Beginning with a regularized constrained formulation that includes a sparsity promoting regularization term, we employ a gradient based algorithm in which gradients with respect to the model parameters are efficiently computed using the adjoint state method. Nonlinear constraints are handled through a Newton Raphson procedure. By solving a sequence of problems with decreasing regularization, we trace a solution path that improves stability and enables the exploration of multiple candidate solutions. The method is applied to the latent dynamics discovery problem in simulation, highlighting performance as a function of ground truth sparsity and semi convergence behavior."

Due to the high dimensionality of this kinetic equation and the coexistence of multiple characteristic scales in the transport processes, conventional solution strategies incur prohibitively high computational costs and are inadequate for rapid response for parametric analysis and optimisation loops in engineering design simulations. This paper proposes an \textit{a priori} reduced-order method based on the proper generalised decomposition to solve the high-dimensional, parametrised Shakhov kinetic model equation. This method reduces the original problem into a few low-dimensional problem by formulating separated representations for the low-rank solution, as well as data and operators in the equation, thereby overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, a general solution can be calculated once and for all in the whole range of the rarefaction parameter, enabling fast and multiple queries to a specific solution at any point in the parameter space. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the method to simulate rarefied gas flow with high accuracy and significant reduction in CPU time and memory requirements."

As a first step, I establish Mazur's conjecture for certain triples $(E, K, p)$ under explicit hypotheses. Building on this, I prove analogous results for Greenberg Selmer groups attached to modular forms that are congruent mod $p$ to $E$, including all specializations arising from Hida families of fixed tame level.

In this paper, we develop a selective focusing method for identifying multiple unknown buried scatterers in a layered medium. The method is derived through the asymptotic analysis of the time reversal operator using the layered Green's function and limited aperture measurements. We begin by showing the global focusing property of the time reversal operator. Then we demonstrate that each small sound-soft particle gives rise to one significant eigenvalue of the time reversal operator, while each sound-hard particle gives three. The associated eigenfunction generates an incident wave focusing selectively on the corresponding unknown particle. Finally, we employ the time reversal method as an initial indicator and propose an effective Bayesian inversion scheme to reconstruct multiple buried extended scatterers for enhanced resolution. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the efficiency."

These HUAVs operate in environments that include noise-restricted zones, referred to as quiet zones, where only electric mode is permitted. We address the problem by parameterizing the position of a point along the side of the quiet zone using its endpoints and a scalar parameter, transforming the problem into a variant of finding the shortest path over a graph of convex sets. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer convex program (MICP), which can be efficiently solved using commercial solvers. Additionally, a tight lower bound can be obtained by relaxing the path-selection variable. Through extensive computations across 200 instances over four maps, we show a substantial improvement in computational efficiency over a state-of-the-art method, achieving up to a 100-fold and 10-fold decrease in computation time for calculating the lower bound and the exact solution, respectively. Moreover, the average gap between the exact cost and the lower bound was approximately 0.24%, and the exact cost was 1.05% lower than the feasible solution from the state-of-the-art approach on average, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We also extend our approach to plan the HUAV route to visit a set of targets and return to its starting location in environments with quiet zones, yielding a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We employ two methodologies to solve the TSP: one where the SOC at each target is discretized, and another where it is assumed to be the minimum allowable level upon departure. A comparative analysis reveals the second method achieves a cost within 1.02% of the first on average while requiring significantly less computational time."

The underlying method uses orthogonal polynomial integral collocation by which successive integrals are taken to approximate all lower order states. Hence, one set of polynomial coefficients can represent an entire coordinate's degree of freedom. Specifically, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kind and Legendre polynomials are used over their associated common interpolating grids derived from the bases' roots and extrema. Simple example problems compare different polynomial bases' performance to analytical solutions. The planar circular orbit raising problem is used to verify the method with solutions obtained by other pseudospectral methods in literature.

Previous work established theoretical guarantees for stochastic localization (SL) in continuous domains, where MCMC methods efficiently estimate the required posterior expectations during SL iterations. However, achieving similar convergence guarantees for discrete MCMC samplers in posterior estimation presents unique theoretical challenges. In this work, we present the first application of SL to general BQDs, proving that after a certain number of iterations, the external field of posterior distributions constructed by SL tends to infinity almost everywhere, hence satisfy Poincaré inequalities with probability near to 1, leading to polynomial-time mixing. This theoretical breakthrough enables efficient sampling from general BQDs, even those that may not originally possess fast mixing properties. Furthermore, our analysis, covering enormous discrete MCMC samplers based on Glauber dynamics and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, demonstrates the broad applicability of our theoretical framework. Experiments on instances with quadratic unconstrained binary objectives, including maximum independent set, maximum cut, and maximum clique problems, demonstrate consistent improvements in sampling efficiency across different discrete MCMC samplers."

The framework reduces dynamic optimization problems - arising in both control and estimation - to efficient projection computations. Split-as-a-Pro builds on a non-parametric formulation that exploits system structure to separate dynamic constraints imposed by individual subsystems from external ones, such as interconnection constraints and input/output constraints. This enables the use of arbitrary system representations, as long as the associated projection is efficiently computable, thereby enhancing scalability and compatibility with gray-box modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Split-as-a-Pro by developing a distributed algorithm for solving finite-horizon linear quadratic control problems and illustrate its use in predictive control. Our numerical case studies show that algorithms obtained using Split-as-a-Pro significantly outperform their centralized counterparts in runtime and scalability across various standard graph topologies, while seamlessly leveraging both model-based and data-driven system representations."

A self-map $τ$ of $W$ such that $τ_{σθ}\in \{τ_θ,\ στ_θ\}$ for all $θ\in W$ and all reflections $σ$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $σ$ range over smaller, $θ$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$."
2505.19391,Existence of self-similar solutions for the surface diffusion flow with nonlinear boundary conditions in the half space,['math.AP'],"['Tomoro Asai', 'Yoshihito Kohsaka']","We study the Mullins' problem that was proposed by Mullins in 1957 and is one of the models of the thermal grooving by surface diffusion. Mathematically, this is the problem of evolving curves in the half space that is governed by the surface diffusion flow with the contact angle condition and the no-flux condition on the boundary. The no-flux condition is represented as the equation that the first order derivative of the curvature with respect to the arc-length parameter is equal to zero, so that it is the nonlinear boundary condition. For this original Mullins' problem, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the self-similar solution. The self-similar solution is obtained as the mild solution under the smallness assumption on the contact angle and the gradient difference between the solutions to the nonlinear and the linear problems."

Berahas', 'Raghu Bollapragada', 'Shagun Gupta']","In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Retrospective Approximation (RA) paradigm to solve optimization problems with a stochastic objective function and general nonlinear deterministic constraints. This framework sequentially constructs increasingly accurate approximations of the true problems which are solved to a specified accuracy via a deterministic solver, thereby decoupling the uncertainty from the optimization. Such frameworks retain the advantages of deterministic optimization methods, such as fast convergence, while achieving the optimal performance of stochastic methods without the need to redesign algorithmic components. For problems with general nonlinear equality constraints, we present a framework that can employ any deterministic solver and analyze its theoretical work complexity. We then present an instance of the framework that employs a deterministic Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method and that achieves optimal complexity in terms of gradient evaluations and linear system solves for this class of problems. For problems with general nonlinear constraints, we present an RA-based algorithm that employs an SQP method with robust subproblems. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of the proposed framework on multi-class logistic regression problems and benchmark instances from the CUTEst test set, comparing its results to established methods from the literature."

We study the behavior of the asymptotic variance as $\varepsilon \to 0$. In some situations (for instance if there were no jumps), then the asymptotic variance vanishes as $\varepsilon \to 0$. When the jumps are ""chaotic"", however, the asymptotic variance may be bounded from above and bounded away from $0$, as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This phenomenon is known as residual diffusivity, and we prove this occurs when the jumps are determined by certain expanding Bernoulli maps."

Here we show that this bundle is generally non-trivial by a sample computation. One principal application is differential geometric, and the other is about algebraic $K$-theory of the integers and the rationals. We find new curvature constraint phenomena for smooth and singular $\mathcal{G}$-connections on principal $\mathcal{G}$-bundles over $S ^{4}$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is $\operatorname {PU} (2)$ or $\operatorname {Ham} (S ^{2} )$. Even for the classical group $\operatorname {PU} (2)$ these phenomena are inaccessible to known techniques like the Yang-Mills theory. The above mentioned computation is the geometric component used to show that the categorified algebraic $K$-theory of the integers and the rationals, defined in ~\cite{cite_SavelyevAlgKtheory} following Toën, admits a $\mathbb{Z} $ injection in degree $4$.

2505.19346,IsoGeometric Suitable Coupling Methods for Partitioned Multiphysics Simulation with Application to Fluid-Structure Interaction,['math.NA'],"['Jing-Ya Li', 'Hugo M. Verhelst', 'Henk den Besten', 'Matthias Möller']","This paper presents spline-based coupling methods for partitioned multiphysics simulations, specifically designed for isogeometric analysis (IGA) based solvers. Traditional vertex-based coupling approaches face significant challenges when applied to IGA solvers, including geometric accuracy issues, interpolation errors, and substantial communication overhead. The methodology draws on the IGA mathematical framework to deliver coupling solutions that preserve high-order continuity and exact geometric representation of splines. We develop two complementary strategies: (1) a spline-vertex coupling method enabling efficient interaction between IGA and conventional solvers, and (2) a fully isogeometric coupling approach maximizing accuracy for IGA-to-IGA communication.
  Both theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our spline-based methods significantly reduce communication overhead compared to traditional approaches while enhancing geometric accuracy through exact boundary representation and maintaining higher-order solution continuity across coupled interfaces. We quantitatively confirm communication efficiency benefits through systematic measurements of transfer times and data volumes across various mesh refinement levels. Our benchmark studies demonstrate geometric fidelity advantages while highlighting how splines naturally preserve solution derivatives across interfaces without requiring additional computation. This work provides efficient coupling strategies tailored to IGA-based solvers and establishes a practical bridge between IGA and traditional discretization methods, enabling broader adoption of IGA in established simulation workflows."

2505.19340,Visibility in graphs under edge and vertex removal,['math.CO'],"['Pakanun Dokyeesun', 'Csilla Bujtás']","For a connected graph $G$ and $X\subseteq V(G)$, we say that two vertices $u$, $v$ are $X$-visible if there is a shortest $u,v$-path $P$ with $V(P)\cap X \subseteq \{u,v\}$. If every two vertices from $X$ are $X$-visible, then $X$ is a mutual-visibility set in $G$. The largest cardinality of such a set in $G$ is the mutual-visibility number $μ(G)$. When the visibility constraint is extended to further types of vertex pairs, we get the definitions of outer, dual, and total mutual-visibility sets and the respective graph invariants $μ_o(G)$, $μ_d(G)$, and $μ_t(G)$.
  This work concentrates on the possible changes in the four visibility invariants when an edge $e$ or a vertex $x$ is removed from $G$ and the graph remains connected. It is proved that $\frac{1}{2}μ(G) \le μ(G-e) \le 2μ(G)$ and $\frac{1}{6}μ_o(G) \le μ_o(G-e) \le 2μ_o(G)+1$ hold for every graph. Further general upper bounds established here are $μ_t(G-e) \leq μ_t(G)+2$ and $μ(G-x) \leq 2μ(G)$. For all but one of the remaining cases, it is shown that the visibility invariant may increase or decrease arbitrarily under the considered local operation. For example, neither $μ_d(G-e)$ nor $μ_d(G-x)$ allows lower or upper bounds of the form $a \cdot μ_d(G)+b$ with a positive constant $a$. Along the way, the realizability of the four visibility invariants in terms of the order is also characterized in the paper."

Furthermore, X is atoroidally symplectic if there is an atoroidal cohomology class $u\in H^2(X;F)$ such that $u^n$ is non-zero. We prove that every atoroidally symplectic CW-complex X of dimension 2n has topological complexity 4n.
  This generalizes a result of Grant and Mescher who prove the corresponding statement in the case where X is an atoroidally c-symplectic manifold and u is a de Rham cohomology class. Using this generalisation, we obtain new calculations of topological complexity, including for many products of 3-manifolds and of group presentation complexes."

We first use the dual approach to transform it into a linear operator, and then introduce a Fractional-Boundary-Regularized Deep Galerkin Method (FBR-DGM) that augments the classical $L^2$ loss with Sobolev-Slobodeckij norms on the parabolic boundary, enforcing regularity and yielding consistent improvements in the network approximation and its derivatives. The improved accuracy allows the network to be converted back to the original solution using the dual transform. The self-consistency and stability of the network can be tested by checking the primal-dual relationship among optimal value, optimal wealth, and optimal control, offering innovative benchmarks in the absence of analytical solutions."
2505.19303,Dynamical Frames and Hyperinvariant Subspaces,['math.FA'],"['Victor Bailey', 'Deguang Han', 'Keri Kornelson', 'David Larson', 'Rui Liu']","The theory of dynamical frames evolved from practical problems in dynamical sampling where the initial state of a vector needs to be recovered from the space-time samples of evolutions of the vector. This leads to the investigation of structured frames obtained from the orbits of evolution operators. One of the basic problems in dynamical frame theory is to determine the semigroup representations, which we will call central frame representations, whose frame generators are unique (up to equivalence). Recently, Christensen, Hasannasab, and Philipp proved that all frame representations of the semigroup $\Bbb{Z}_{+}$ have this property. Their proof of this result relies on the characterization of the structure of shift-invariant subspaces in $H^2(\mathbb{D})$ due to Beurling. In this paper we settle the general uniqueness problem by presenting a characterization of central frame representations for any semigroup in terms of the co-hyperinvariant subspaces of the left regular representation of the semigroup. This result is not only consistent with the known result of Han-Larson in 2000 for group representation frames, but also proves that all the frame generators of a semigroup generated by any $k$-tuple $(A_1, ... A_k)$ of commuting bounded linear operators on a separable Hilbert space $H$ are equivalent, a case where the structure of shift-invariant subspaces, or submodules, of the Hardy Space on polydisks $H^{2}(\Bbb{D}^k)$ is still not completely characterized."

The main goal is to determine the automorphisms of the Quantum Plane that commutes with a fixed derivation $δ$. We describe conditions under which the isotropy group $\text{Aut}_δ(A)$ is trivial, finite, or infinite, depending on the structure of $δ$ and whether $q$ is a root of unity: additionally, we present the structure of the group in the finite case. A key tool is the analysis of polynomial equations of the form $μ_1^a μ_2^b = 1$, arising from monomials in the inner part of $δ$. We also make explicit which finite subgroups of $Aut(\Bbbk_q[x, y])$ are isotropy groups of some derivation: either $q$ root of unity or not. Techniques from algebraic geometry, such as intersection multiplicity, are also employed in the classification of the finite case."

2505.19257,Existence of Conical Higher cscK Metrics on a Minimal Ruled Surface,"['math.DG', 'math.CV']",['Rajas Sandeep Sompurkar'],A `higher extremal Kähler metric' is defined (motivated by analogy with the definition of an extremal Kähler metric) as a Kähler metric whose top Chern form and volume form ``differ'' by a smooth function whose gradient is a holomorphic vector field. A special case of this kind of metric is a `higher constant scalar curvature Kähler (higher cscK) metric' which is defined (again by analogy with the definition of a constant scalar curvature Kähler (cscK) metric) as a Kähler metric whose top Chern form is a real constant multiple of its volume form or equivalently whose top Chern form is harmonic. In our previous paper on higher extremal Kähler metrics we had looked at a special class of minimal ruled surfaces called as `pseudo-Hirzebruch surfaces' all of which contain two special divisors (viz. the zero and infinity divisors) and have got some nice symmetries which enable the use of the momentum construction method for finding explicit examples of these kinds of ``canonical'' metrics. We had proven that every Kähler class on such a surface admits a higher extremal Kähler metric which is not higher cscK and we had further proven that higher cscK metrics do not exist in any Kähler class on such a surface. In this paper we will see that if we allow our metrics to develop `conical singularities' along at least one of the two divisors then we do get `conical higher cscK metrics' in each Kähler class of the surface by the momentum construction method. We will show that our constructed metrics are ``genuine'' conical Kähler metrics and we will interpret the conical higher cscK equation globally on the surface in terms of currents. We will then introduce and employ the `top $\log$ Bando-Futaki invariant' to obtain the linear relationship between the cone angles of the conical singularities of our constructed metrics along the zero and infinity divisors.

As a consequence, we prove that this skein theory is also shared by the $V_1$-polynomial defined by two of the authors, deducing the equality of the two link polynomials. This implies specialization properties of the $V_1$-polynomial to the Alexander polynomial and to the $\mathrm{ADO}_3$-invariant, the fact that it is a Vassiliev power series invariant, as well as a Seifert genus bound for knots."

Kolmogorov equation serves as simple, yet rich enough in the present context, model problem for a wide range of kinetic-type equations: although it involves diffusion in one of the two spatial dimensions only, the combined nature of the first order transport/drift term and the degenerate diffusion are sufficient to `propagate dissipation' across the spatial domain in its entirety. This is a manifestation of the celebrated concept of hypocoercivity, a term coined and studied extensively by Villani in [27]. We show that the standard, classical, space-time discontinuous Galerkin method, admits a corresponding hypocoercivity property at the discrete level, asymptotically for large times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of this kind for any standard Galerkin scheme. This property is shown by proving one part of a discrete inf-sup-type stability result for the method in a family of norms dictated by a modified scalar product motivated by the theory in [27]. This family of norms contains the full gradient of the numerical solution, thereby allowing for a full spectral gap/Poincaré-type inequality at the discrete level, thus, showcasing a subtle, discretisation-parameter-dependent, numerical hypocoercivity property. Further, we show that the space-time discontinuous Galerkin method is inf-sup stable in the family of norms containing the full gradient of the numerical solution, which may be a result of independent interest."

2505.19157,Efficient and robust solvers for a cell-by-cell dual-poroelasticity problem,['math.NA'],"['Marius Causemann', 'Miroslav Kuchta']","This paper presents a scalable and robust solver for a cell-by-cell dual-poroelasticity model, describing the mechanical interactions between brains cells embedded in extracellular space. Explicitly representing the complex cellular shapes, the proposed approach models both intracellular and extracellular spaces as distinct poroelastic media, separated by a permeable cell membrane which allows hydrostatic and osmotic pressure-driven fluid exchange. Based on a three-field (displacement, total pressure, and fluid pressure) formulation, the solver leverages the framework of norm equivalent preconditioning and appropriately fitted norms to ensure robustness across all material parameters of the model. Scalability for large and complex geometries is achieved through efficient Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) approximations of the preconditioners' individual blocks. Furthermore, we accommodate diverse boundary conditions, including full Dirichlet boundary conditions for displacement, which we handle efficiently using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by numerical experiments demonstrating the preconditioners' robustness and performance across various parameters relevant to realistic scenarios, and a large scale example of cellular swelling on a dense reconstruction of the mouse visual cortex highlights the method's potential for investigating complex physiological processes like cellular volume regulation in detailed biological structures."

We consider S-unit equations over $\mathcal{M}$: these are equations of the form $x_1 m_1 + \cdots + x_K m_K = m_0$, where the variables $x_1, \ldots, x_K$ range over the set of monomials (with coefficient 1) of $\mathbb{Z}_{/T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_N^{\pm}]$. When $T$ is a power of a prime number $p$, we show that the solution set of an S-unit equation over $\mathcal{M}$ is effectively $p$-normal in the sense of Derksen and Masser (2015), generalizing their result on S-unit equations in fields of prime characteristic. When $T$ is an arbitrary positive integer, we show that deciding whether an S-unit equation over $\mathcal{M}$ admits a solution is Turing equivalent to solving a system of linear-exponential Diophantine equations, whose base contains the prime divisors of $T$. Combined with a recent result of Karimov, Luca, Nieuwveld, Ouaknine and Worrell (2025), this yields decidability when $T$ has at most two distinct prime divisors. This also shows that proving either decidability or undecidability in the case of arbitrary $T$ would entail major breakthroughs in number theory.
  We mention some potential applications of our results, such as deciding Submonoid Membership in wreath products of the form $\mathbb{Z}_{/p^a q^b} \wr \mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as progressing towards solving the Skolem problem in rings whose additive group is torsion. More connections in these directions will be explored in follow up papers."

One component is a data-driven or learning-based predictive controller, which uses data samples to learn a model and predict the future behavior of the system. We exemplify this component concisely by data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) and by model predictive control based on extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). The second component is a model-free high-gain feedback controller, which ensures satisfaction of the output constraints if that cannot be guaranteed by the predictive controller. This may be the case, for example, if too little data has been collected for learning or no (sufficient) guarantees on the approximation accuracy derived. In particular, the reactive/adaptive feedback controller can be used to support the learning process by leading safely through the state space to collect suitable data, e.g., to ensure a sufficiently-small fill distance. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the combination of EDMD-based model predictive control and a safeguarding feedback for the set-point transitions including the transition between the set points within prescribed bounds."

By utilizing a given finite set of nodal data, we propose an optimization framework to find the potential $\hat q$ that is most closely approximating a predefined target potential $q_0$. The inverse nodal optimization problem is reformulated as a solvability problem for a class of nonlinear Schrödinger equations, enabling systematic investigation of the inverse nodal problem. {As an example, when the constant target potential $q_0$ is considered, we find that the Schrödinger equations are completely integrable and conclude that the potential $\hat q$ is `periodic' in a certain sense. Furthermore, the reconstruction of $\hat q$ is reduced to solving a system of three featured parameters, thereby establishing an explicit quantitative relationship between $\|\hat q\|_{Lp}$ and $T_*$. Of importance, we prove the uniqueness of the potential $\hat q$ when $p>3/2$. These new findings represent a substantial advancement in this field of study. Our methodology also bridges theoretical rigor with practical applicability, addressing scenarios where only partial nodal information is available."
2505.19124,Asymptotic Efficiency Analysis of the Recursive Least-Squares Algorithm for ARX Systems Without Projection,['math.OC'],"['Xingrui Liu', 'Jieming Ke', 'Yanlong Zhao']","This paper investigates the optimality analysis of the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm for autoregressive systems with exogenous inputs (ARX systems). A key challenge in analyzing is managing the potential unboundedness of the parameter estimates, which may diverge to infinity. Previous approaches addressed this issue by assuming that both the true parameter and the RLS estimates remain confined within a known compact set, thereby ensuring uniform boundedness throughout the analysis. In contrast, we propose a new analytical framework that eliminates the need for such a boundness assumption. Specifically, we establish a quantitative relationship between the bounded moment conditions of quasi-stationary input/output signals and the convergence rate of the tail probability of the RLS estimation error. Based on this technique, we prove that when system inputs/outputs have bounded twentieth-order moments, the RLS algorithm achieves asymptotic normality and the covariance matrix of the RLS algorithm converges to the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB), confirming its asymptotic efficiency. These results demonstrate that the RLS algorithm is an asymptotically optimal identification algorithm for ARX systems, even without the projection operators to ensure that parameter estimates reside within a prior known compact set."

We show that the simplicial complex constructed with normal forms of the rational 3-tangle is contractible. As an effectiveness of the contractibility of the simplicial complex by normal forms of $T$, we would choose a minimal normal coordinate of $T$ with a certain rule for the representative for the rational $3$-tangle $T$.

For bounded domains in unweighted $\mathbf{R}^n$, the uniqueness was shown for the $p$-Laplace operator $Δ_p$ and all $p$ by Kichenassamy--Véron (Math. Ann. 275 (1986), 599-615), while for $p=2$ it is an easy consequence of the linearity of the Laplace operator $Δ$. Beyond that, uniqueness is only known in some particular cases, such as in Ahlfors $p$-regular spaces, as shown by Bonk--Capogna--Zhou (arXiv:2211.11974). When the singularity $x_0$ has positive $p$-capacity, the Green function is a particular multiple of the capacitary potential for $\text{cap}_p(\{x_0\},Ω)$ and is therefore unique. Here we give a sufficient condition for uniqueness in metric spaces, and provide an example showing that the range of $p$ for which it holds (while $x_0$ has zero $p$-capacity) can be a nondegenerate interval. In the opposite direction, we give the first example showing that uniqueness can fail in metric spaces, even for $p=2$."

  We show that ${G}_{λ/μ}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w})$ is symmetric in the $\textbf{x}$ variables. By building a crystal structure on set-valued reverse plane partitions, we obtain the expansion of ${G}_{λ/μ}(\textbf{x};\textbf{t};\textbf{w})$ in the basis of Schur functions, extending previous work by Monical--Pechenik--Scrimshaw and Galashin. Based on the Schur expansion, we deduce that hybrid Grothendieck polynomials of straight shapes have saturated Newton polytopes.

Examples include not only the distributed control of elliptic PDEs such as the Poisson equation discussed in this paper in detail but also parabolic and hyperbolic equations. The approach covers the standard $L^2$ setting as well as the more recent energy regularization, also including state and control constraints. We discretize OCPs subject to parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs by means of space-time finite elements similar as in the elliptic case. We discuss regularization and finite element error estimates, and derive an optimal relation between the regularization parameter and the finite element mesh size in order to balance the accuracy, and the energy costs for the corresponding control. Finally, we also discuss the efficient solution of the resulting systems of algebraic equations, and their use in a state-based nested iteration procedure that allows us to compute finite element approximations to the state and the control in asymptotically optimal complexity. The numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings quantitatively."

Here, $Δ(R)$ stands for the extension of the Jacobson radical and is defined as the maximal subring of $J(R)$ invariant under the unit multiplication. We present a systematic framework for these rings by detailing their foundational characteristics and algebraic behavior under standard constructions, as well as we explore their key relationships with other well-established ring classes. Our findings demonstrate that all strongly $Δ$-clean rings are inherently strongly clean and $ΔU$, but under centrality constraints they refine the category of uniquely clean rings. Additionally, we derive criteria for the strong $Δ$-clean property in triangular matrix rings, their skew analogs, trivial extensions, and group rings. The analysis reveals deep ties to boolean rings, local rings, and quasi-duo rings by offering new structural insights in their algebraic characterization."
2505.19036,Weak Physics Informed Neural Networks for Geometry Compatible Hyperbolic Conservation Laws on Manifolds,"['math.NA', 'stat.ML']","['Hanfei Zhou', 'Lei Shi']","Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), owing to their mesh-free nature, offer a powerful approach for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) in complex geometries, including irregular domains. This capability effectively circumvents the challenges of mesh generation that traditional numerical methods face in high-dimensional or geometrically intricate settings. While recent studies have extended PINNs to manifolds, the theoretical foundations remain scarce. Existing theoretical analyses of PINNs in Euclidean space often rely on smoothness assumptions for the solutions. However, recent empirical evidence indicates that PINNs may struggle to approximate solutions with low regularity, such as those arising from nonlinear hyperbolic equations. In this paper, we develop a framework for PINNs tailored to the efficient approximation of weak solutions, particularly nonlinear hyperbolic equations defined on manifolds. We introduce a novel weak PINN (wPINN) formulation on manifolds that leverages the well-posedness theory to approximate entropy solutions of geometry-compatible hyperbolic conservation laws on manifolds. Employing tools from approximation theory, we establish a convergence analysis of the algorithm, including an analysis of approximation errors for time-dependent entropy solutions. This analysis provides insight into the accumulation of approximation errors over long time horizons. Notably, the network complexity depends only on the intrinsic dimension, independent of the ambient space dimension. Our results match the minimax rate in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, demonstrating that PINNs can alleviate the curse of dimensionality in the context of low-dimensional manifolds. Finally, we validate the performance of the proposed wPINN framework through numerical experiments, confirming its ability to efficiently approximate entropy solutions on manifolds."

Due to the geometry of the nozzle, we first introduce new variable to prove the existence of radially symmetric subsonic flows to the steady Euler-Poisson system. We then investigate the structural stability of the background subsonic flow under perturbations of suitable boundary conditions, and establish the existence and uniqueness of smooth subsonic Euler-Poisson flows with nonzero vorticity. The solution shares the same regularity for the velocity, the pressure, the entropy and the electric potential. The deformation-curl-Poisson decomposition is utilized to reformulate the steady Euler-Poisson system as a deformation-curl-Poisson system together with several transport equations. The key point lies on the analysis of the well-posedness of the boundary value problem for the associated linearized elliptic system, which is established by using a special structure of the system to derive a priori estimates. The result also indicates that the electric field force in compressible flows can counteract the geometric effects of the convergent nozzle to stabilize certain physical features of the flow."

  Our study has two main objectives: analyzing the asymptotic behavior near isolated singularities and establishing radial symmetry of positive singular solutions.
  First, employing asymptotic analysis, we characterize the local behavior of solutions near the singularity.
  Specifically, we show that, within a punctured ball, solutions behave like the blow-up limit profile.
  This is achieved through classification results for entire bubble solutions, a standard blow-up procedure, and a removable singularity theorem, yielding sharp upper and lower bounds near the origin.
  To run the blow-up analysis, we develop an asymptotic integral version of the moving spheres technique, a technique of independent interest.
  Second, we establish the radial symmetry of blow-up limit solutions using an integral moving spheres method.
  On the technical level, we apply the integral dual method from Jin, Li, Xiong \cite{MR3694645, arxiv:1901.01678} to provide local asymptotic estimates within the punctured ball and to prove that solutions in the entire punctured space are radially symmetric with respect to the origin.

Williams', 'Mathijs Wintraecken']","One frequently needs to interpolate or approximate gradients on simplicial meshes. Unfortunately, there are very few explicit mathematical results governing the interpolation or approximation of vector-valued functions on Delaunay meshes in more than two dimensions. Most of the existing results are tailored towards interpolation with piecewise linear polynomials. In contrast, interpolation with piecewise high-order polynomials is not well understood. In particular, the results in this area are sometimes difficult to immediately interpret, or to specialize to the Delaunay setting. In order to address this issue, we derive explicit error estimates for high-order, piecewise polynomial gradient interpolation and approximation on protected Delaunay meshes. In addition, we generalize our analysis beyond gradients, and obtain error estimates for sufficiently-smooth vector fields. Throughout the paper, we show that the quality of interpolation and approximation often depends (in part) on the minimum thickness of simplices in the mesh. Fortunately, the minimum thickness can be precisely controlled on protected Delaunay meshes in $\mathbb{R}^d$."

Altuğ studied $\mathsf{GL}_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting. The first step involves isolating specific representations, especially the residual part of the spectral side, in the elliptic part of the geometric side of the trace formula. We generalize this step to the case with ramification at $S=\{\infty,q_1,\dots,q_r\}$ with $2\in S$, thereby fully resolving the problem of isolating these representations over $\mathbb{Q}$ which remained unresolved for over a decade. Such a formula that isolates the specific representations is derived by modifying Altuğ's approach. We use the approximate functional equation to ensure the validity of the Poisson summation formula. Then, we compute the residues of specific functions to isolate the desired representations."

This framework proposes a paradigm shift in the way algebraic structures are conceived: instead of enforcing uniform global rules, it introduces stratified layers with context-dependent interactions. Such a rethinking of algebraic organization allows for the modeling of systems where local consistency coexists with global asymmetry, non-associativity, and semantic transitions."

Such objects have attracted interest from various authors, particularly due to their appearance in different contexts: such as in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory and in the study of locally convex curves. We study the homotopy type of the intersection of two real Bruhat cells. This homotopy type is the same as that of an explicit submanifold of the group of real lower triangular matrices with diagonal entries equal to 1. For $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ matrices with $n\leq4$, these submanifolds are the disjoint union of contractible connected components. Our focus is on such intersections for $6\times6$ real matrices. For this, we study the connected components of Bruhat cells for permutations $σ\in\Sn_6$ with at most 12 inversions. We make use of the structure of the dual CW complexes associated with these components. We show that for permutations with at most 12 inversions, with the exception of $σ=[563412]$ , all connected components are contractible. Furthermore, for $σ=[563412]$, we identify new non-contractible connected components with the homotopy type of the circle."

We establish mathematical guarantees for the existence and stability of invariant fractal attractors by leveraging contractivity conditions, Lyapunov-type criteria, and measure-theoretic arguments. Empirically, we design a set of high-resolution simulations across diverse nonlinear functions and probabilistic schemes to analyze the emergent attractors geometry and dimensionality. A box-counting method is used to estimate the fractal dimension, revealing attractors with rich internal structure and dimensions ranging from 1.4 to 1.89. Additionally, we present a case study comparing RNIFS to the classical Sierpiński triangle, demonstrating the generalization's ability to preserve global shape while enhancing geometric complexity. These findings affirm the capacity of RNIFS to model intricate, self-similar structures beyond the reach of traditional deterministic systems, offering new directions for the study of random fractals in both theory and applications."

In this paper, an existing mathematical model of $β-$cell dynamics is analyzed using a three-time-scale framework to study interactions among fast, intermediate, and slow variables. Through Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT), the influence of ATP on oscillatory dynamics via membrane potential is explored. At the non-hyperbolic point, where standard methods fail, blow-up analysis is applied to investigate canard dynamics shaped by intermediate and slow variables. Numerical simulations with varied parameters reveal the glucose-dependent oscillations linked to slow dynamics near the pseudo-singular points. By leveraging the pseudo-singular point, the linger time is defined, and simulated results for the coupling strength needed for bursting initiation synchronization are presented as a sufficient condition. This study links mathematics and biology, offering insights into diabetic studies."

2505.18811,An Anarchist Approach to the Undergraduate Mathematics Curriculum,['math.HO'],"['Vincent Bouchard', 'Asia Matthews']","Contemporary anarchism centers around three tenets: (1) a constant challenge of and resistance to all forms of domination, (2) so-called ""prefigurative politics"", in which all decisions are made in a manner that is consistent with a set of non-hierarchical values such as equality, decentralization and voluntary cooperation, (3) a focus on diversity and open-endedness (Gordon, 2008). Within this philosophy the notion of end goals becomes moot; progress, then, is measured by process, in which the values of diversity, pluralism, cooperation, autonomy and experimentation are celebrated. In this perspective piece we propose anarchism as a philosophical framework to address the perceived cognitive dissonances of the current undergraduate mathematics curriculum. Are learning outcomes appropriate in an anarchist approach to education? How can we address the power dynamics of grading and assessment? How can assessment be done in the context of a process-based and horizontal approach that celebrates diversity and autonomy? Should grades be used, and if so, how could they be assigned non-hierarchically? At its core, anarchism aims at aligning thoughts and actions, and we argue that an anarchist viewpoint on undergraduate mathematics addresses the cognitive dissonances that currently plague our curriculum. We propose food for thought for individual instructors' practice, including ideas for incremental and large-scale changes."

We introduce a novel numerical scheme tailored for semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations and further address more general settings using the concepts of discrete gradient pairs and Dirac-dissipative structures. Additionally, the behavior under system transformations is investigated and we demonstrate that under suitable assumptions port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations admit a representation which consists of a parametrized port-Hamiltonian semi-explicit system and an unstructured equation.

FPANs are notoriously difficult to analyze, and algorithms using FPANs are often published without rigorous correctness proofs. In fact, on at least one occasion, a published error bound for a widely used FPAN was later found to be incorrect. In this paper, we present an automatic procedure that produces computer-verified proofs of several FPAN correctness properties, including error bounds that are tight to the nearest bit. Our approach is underpinned by a novel floating-point abstraction that models the sign, exponent, and number of leading and trailing zeros and ones in the mantissa of each number flowing through an FPAN.

2505.18737,A generalized Riemann problem solver for a hyperbolic model of two-layer thin film flow,"['math.NA', 'math.AP']","['Rahul Barthwal', 'Christian Rohde', 'Yue Wang']","In this paper, a second-order generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver is developed for a two-layer thin film model. Extending the first-order Godunov approach, the solver is used to construct a temporal-spatial coupled second-order GRP-based finite-volume method. Numerical experiments including comparisons to MUSCL finite-volume schemes with Runge-Kutta time stepping confirm the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the higher-order ansatz.
  The construction of GRP methods requires to compute temporal derivatives of intermediate states in the entropy solution of the generalized Riemann problem. These derivatives are obtained from the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions as well as a characteristic decomposition using Riemann invariants. Notably, the latter can be computed explicitly for the two-layer thin film model, which renders this system to be very suitable for the GRP approach. Moreover, it becomes possible to determine the derivatives in an explicit, computationally cheap way."

This method consists of grouping states together (via a partition of the state space), then constructing two one-dimensional birth and death processes that lower and upper bound the initial process under simple assumptions on the infinitesimal generators of the processes. The construction of these bounding processes is based on coupling arguments and transport theory. The bounding processes are easy to analyse analytically and numerically and allow us to derive properties on the initial continuous-time Markov chain. We focus on two important properties: the behavior of the process at infinity through the existence of a stationary distribution and the error in truncating the state space to numerically solve the master equation describing the time evolution of the probability distribution of the process. We derive explicit formulas for constructing the optimal bounding processes for a given partition, making the method easy to use in practice. We finally discuss the importance of the choice of the partition to obtain relevant results and illustrate the method on an example chemical reaction network."

In this paper, we extend the unconditional admissible support to $(-\frac{15}8,\frac{15}8)$. The key tools in our approach are analytic estimates for integrals appearing in the Kutznetsov trace formula, as well as a reduction to bounds on Dirichlet polynomials, which eventually are obtained from the large sieve and the fourth moment bound for Dirichlet $L$-functions. Assuming the Grand Density Conjecture, we extend the admissible support to $(-2,2)$. In addition, we show that the same techniques also allow for an unconditional improvement of the admissible support in the corresponding family of $L$-functions attached to holomorphic forms."

An essential assumption is that the (indefinite) Hermitian inner product on differential forms/vector fields provides an isomorphism with the module dual.

The optimal ratio, $r_{\text{opt}}$, is defined as the value at which the self-similar regions of the resulting fractal touch but do not overlap. Using a series of Python simulations, we explore how the optimal ratio varies across different polytopes, from two-dimensional polygons to three-dimensional polyhedra and beyond. The results, visualized through plots generated for various polytopes and values of the scaling factor $r$, demonstrate that the optimal ratio is not universal but rather depends on each polytope's specific properties. A formula is then derived for determining the optimal ratio for any regular polytope in any dimension. The formula is then experimentally verified using multiple Python programs designed to search and find the optimal ratio iteratively."

The resulting hydrodynamic system consists of a nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system for the (volume averaged) velocity $\mathbf{u}$ and a coupled Cahn-Hilliard system for the phase-field variables $φ$ and $ψ$ that represent the difference in volume fractions of the binary fluids and the surfactant concentration, respectively. For the initial boundary value problem with physically relevant singular potentials subject to a no-slip boundary condition for the fluid velocity and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase-field variables and the chemical potentials, we first establish the existence of global weak solutions in the case of non-degenerate mobilities based on a suitable semi-implicit time discretization. Next, we prove the existence of global weak solutions for a class of general degenerate mobilities, with the aid of a new type of approximations for both the mobilities and the singular parts of the potential densities."

We construct a family of initial vorticities $ω^0_\varepsilon \in C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R}^2)$ converging to $ω^0_{\mathrm{sing}}$ distributionally as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$, and show that the corresponding solutions $ω_\varepsilon(x,t)$ to the 2D incompressible Euler equations converge to the measure defined by the Birkhoff-Rott system with initial datum $ω^0_{\mathrm{sing}}$. The regularization relies on a layer construction designed to exploit the key observation that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability has a strongly anisotropic effect: while vorticities must be analytic in the ""tangential"" direction, the way layers can be arranged in the ""normal"" direction is essentially arbitrary."

The tropical formulation emphasizes dominant intensity variations, contributing to sharper and more continuous edge representations. Three variants are explored: an adaptive threshold-based method, a multi-kernel min-plus method, and a max-plus method emphasizing structural continuity. The framework integrates multi-scale processing, Hessian filtering, and wavelet shrinkage to enhance edge transitions while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on MATLAB built-in grayscale and color images suggest that tropical formulations integrated with classical operators, such as Canny and LoG, can improve boundary detection in low-contrast and textured regions. Quantitative evaluation using standard edge metrics indicates favorable edge clarity and structural coherence. These results highlight the potential of tropical algebra as a scalable and noise-aware formulation for edge detection in practical image analysis tasks."

The solution of such problems can be approximated as closely as desired by hierarchies of semidefinite programming relaxations, based on classical sums of squares certificates due to Putinar and Schmüdgen. When the feasible set is the bi-sphere, i.e., the Cartesian product of two unit spheres, we show that the hierarchies based on the Schmüdgen-type certificates converge to the global minimum of the objective polynomial at a rate in $O(1/t^2)$, where $t$ is the relaxation order. Our proof is based on the polynomial kernel method. We extend this result to arbitrary sphere products and give a general recipe to obtain convergence rates for polynomial optimization over products of distinct sets. Eventually, we rely on our results for the bi-sphere to analyze the speed of convergence of a semidefinite programming hierarchy approximating the order $2$ quantum Wasserstein distance."

Chin', 'Jingyi Wang', 'Cosmin Petra']","Large-scale contact mechanics simulations are crucial in many engineering fields such as structural design and manufacturing. In the frictionless case, contact can be modeled by minimizing an energy functional; however, these problems are often nonlinear, non-convex, and increasingly difficult to solve as mesh resolution increases. In this work, we employ a Newton-based interior-point (IP) filter line-search method; an effective approach for large-scale constrained optimization. While this method converges rapidly, each iteration requires solving a large saddle-point linear system that becomes ill-conditioned as the optimization process converges, largely due to IP treatment of the contact constraints. Such ill-conditioning can hinder solver scalability and increase iteration counts with mesh refinement. To address this, we introduce a novel preconditioner, AMG with Filtering (AMGF), tailored to the Schur complement of the saddle-point system. Building on the classical algebraic multigrid (AMG) solver, commonly used for elasticity, we augment it with a specialized subspace correction that filters near null space components introduced by contact interface constraints. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments on a range of linear and nonlinear contact problems, we demonstrate that the proposed solver achieves mesh independent convergence and maintains robustness against the ill-conditioning that notoriously plagues IP methods. These results indicate that AMGF makes contact mechanics simulations more tractable and broadens the applicability of Newton-based IP methods in challenging engineering scenarios. More broadly, AMGF is well suited for problems, optimization or otherwise, where solver performance is limited by a problematic low-dimensional subspace. This makes the method widely applicable beyond contact mechanics and constrained optimization."

Using the fractional Liouville reduction, we obtain a log-log stability estimate when the conductivities a priori agree in the measurement set and their difference has compact support. In the case in which the conductivities are assumed to agree a priori in the whole exterior of the domain, we obtain a shaper logarithmic stability estimate."

We prove that the value function converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(β)$, where $β^2$ is the diffusivity constant, which matches the classical convergence rate of vanishing viscosity for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. The same rate is also obtained for the approximation of the distribution of players as well as for the gradient of the value function. The proof is a combination of probabilistic and analytical arguments by first analyzing the forward-backward stochastic differential equation associated with the MFG, and then applying a general stability result for HJ equations. Applications of our result to $N$-player games, mean field control, and policy iteration for solving MFGs are also presented."

Using the machinery of combinatorial species, the Bell functions are proven to be the Frobenius characteristics of the permutation representations of symmetric groups on hyper-partitions of certain orders and sizes. In the order 1 case, we are able to give more details about the expansion coefficients of the Bell functions in terms of vector partitions and divisor sums as well as give a recurrence relation analogous to the well known recursion for the Bell numbers.

2505.18481,The Kinetic Limit of Balanced Neural Networks,"['math.PR', 'math.DS']","['James MacLaurin', 'Pedro Vilanova']","The theory of Balanced Neural Networks is a very popular explanation for the high degree of variability and stochasticity in the brain's activity. Roughly speaking, it entails that typical neurons receive many excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The network-wide mean inputs cancel, and one is left with the stochastic fluctuations about the mean. In this paper we determine kinetic equations that describe the population density. The intrinsic dynamics is nonlinear, with multiplicative noise perturbing the state of each neuron. The equations have a spatial dimension, such that the strength-of-connection between neurons is a function of their spatial position. Our method of proof is to decompose the state variables into (i) the network-wide average activity, and (ii) fluctuations about this mean. In the limit, we determine two coupled limiting equations. The requirement that the system be balanced yields implicit equations for the evolution of the average activity. In the large n limit, the population density of the fluctuations evolves according to a Fokker-Planck equation. If one makes an additional assumption that the intrinsic dynamics is linear and the noise is not multiplicative, then one obtains a spatially-distributed neural field equation."
2505.18480,Local Taylor-based polynomial quasi-Trefftz spaces for scalar linear equations,['math.NA'],['Lise-Marie Imbert-Gerard'],"Trefftz-type of Galerkin methods for numerical PDEs use discrete spaces of problem-dependent functions. While Trefftz methods leverage discrete spaces of local exact solutions to the governing PDE, Taylor-based quasi-Trefftz methods leverage discrete spaces of local approximate solutions to the governing PDE. This notion of approximate solution, understood in the sense of a small Taylor remainder, is defined for differential operators with smooth variable coefficients. In both cases, it is possible to use discrete spaces much smaller than standard polynomial space to achieve the same orders of approximation properties.
  The present work is the first systematic study of local Taylor-based polynomial quasi-Trefftz spaces characterized as the kernel of the quasi-Trefftz operator, defined as the composition of Taylor truncation with the differential operator. The proposed linear algebra framework reveals the general structure of this linear operator and applies to any non-trivial linear scalar differential operator with smooth coefficients. It results in a fully explicit procedure to construct a local quasi-Trefftz basis valid in all dimension and for operators of any order, guaranteeing a minimal computational cost for the construction of these equation-dependent bases.
  The local quasi-Trefftz space is formally defined as the kernel of a linear operator between spaces of polynomials. The systematic approach relies on a detailed study of the structure of this operator, strongly leveraging the graded structure of polynomial spaces."
2505.18473,PDPO: Parametric Density Path Optimization,['math.OC'],"['Sebastian Gutierrez Hernandez', 'Peng Chen', 'Haomin Zhou']","We introduce Parametric Density Path Optimization (PDPO), a novel method for computing action-minimizing paths between probability densities. The core idea is to represent the target probability path as the pushforward of a reference density through a parametric map, transforming the original infinite-dimensional optimization over densities to a finite-dimensional one over the parameters of the map. We derive a static formulation of the dynamic problem of action minimization and propose cubic spline interpolation of the path in parameter space to solve the static problem. Theoretically, we establish an error bound of the action under proper assumptions on the regularity of the parameter path. Empirically, we find that using 3-5 control points of the spline interpolation suffices to accurately resolve both multimodal and high-dimensional problems. We demonstrate that PDPO can flexibly accommodate a wide range of potential terms, including those modeling obstacles, mean-field interactions, stochastic control, and higher-order dynamics. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in benchmark tasks, demonstrating superior computational efficiency and solution quality. The source code will be publically available after the revision process."

We provide general robustness conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of physical solutions to the dynamics, and demonstrate their connections to the dynamic percolation theory. We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades."
2505.18443,An Early History of Toric Ideals,"['math.AC', 'math.AG']",['Serkan Hoşten'],Toric ideals are everywhere. They have been in the commutative algebra lexicon since about 1990 when Bernd Sturmfels used the term. The early days of toric ideals and their Gröbner bases were full of new results and promising developments in their applications. Bernd has been consistently their biggest promoter through his own work and that of his collaborators and students. This article is a personal and subjective recalling of the first decade of toric ideals when Bernd played a central role.

2505.18435,Scalable Global Optimization for AC-OPF via Quadratic Convex Relaxation and Branch-and-Bound,['math.OC'],"['Mohammadreza Iranpour', 'Mohammad Rasoul Narimani']","The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is central to the reliable and efficient operation of power systems, yet its non-convex nature poses significant challenges for finding globally optimal solutions. While convex relaxation techniques such as Quadratic Convex (QC) relaxation have shown promise in providing tight lower bounds, they typically do not guarantee global optimality. Conversely, global optimization methods like the Branch and Bound (B\&B) algorithm can ensure optimality but often suffer from high computational costs due to the large search space involved. This paper proposes a novel B\&B-assisted QC relaxation framework for solving the AC-OPF problem that leverages the strengths of both approaches. The method systematically partitions the domains of key OPF variables, specifically, voltage magnitudes and voltage angle differences, into two equal subintervals at each iteration. The QC relaxation is then applied to each subregion to compute a valid lower bound. These bounds are compared against an upper bound obtained from a feasible AC-OPF solution identified at the outset. Subregions that yield lower bounds exceeding the upper bound are pruned from the search, eliminating non-promising portions of the feasible space. By integrating the efficiency of the QC relaxation with the global search structure of the B\&B algorithm, the proposed method significantly reduces the number of subproblems explored while preserving the potential to reach the global optimum. The algorithm is implemented using the PowerModels.jl package and evaluated on a range of PGLib-OPF benchmark cases. Results demonstrate that this hybrid strategy improves computational tractability and solution quality, particularly for large OPF instances."

We study the problem of locating stationary and dynamic inductive charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs), allowing detours from fixed transit routes and schedules. Dynamic charging, which enables energy transfer while driving, reduces space usage in dense urban areas and lowers vehicle idle times. We formulate a cost-minimization problem that considers both infrastructure and operational costs and propose an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm to solve instances of realistic size. Each configuration requires solving a decomposed subproblem comprising multiple resource-constrained shortest-path problems. For this, we employ a bi-directional label-setting algorithm with lazy dominance checks based on local bounds. On adapted benchmark instances, our approach outperforms a commercial solver by up to 60% in solution quality. We further apply our method to a real-world case study in Hof, Germany. Results indicate that, under current cost structures calibrated from a test track in Bad Staffelstein, dynamic inductive charging is not yet cost-competitive with stationary alternatives. We quantify the value of allowing detours at up to 3.5% of the total system cost and show that integrating photovoltaics with decentralized energy storage can yield savings exceeding 20%."
2505.18394,Optimal stopping involving a diffusion and its running maximum: a generalisation of the maximality principle,['math.PR'],"['Neofytos Rodosthenous', 'Mihail Zervos']","The maximality principle has been a valuable tool in identifying the free-boundary functions that are associated with the solutions to several optimal stopping problems involving one-dimensional time-homogeneous diffusions and their running maximum processes. In its original form, the maximality principle identifies an optimal stopping boundary function as the maximal solution to a specific first-order nonlinear ODE that stays strictly below the diagonal in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In the context of a suitably tailored optimal stopping problem, we derive a substantial generalisation of the maximality principle: the optimal stopping boundary function is the maximal solution to a specific first-order nonlinear ODE that is associated with a solution to the optimal stopping problem's variational inequality."

The problem requires either the running or terminal cost to be strongly convex, but other terms may be non-convex. The inclusion of control-dependent diffusion introduces additional complexity in regularity analysis of the associated backward stochastic differential equation. We provide sufficient conditions under which the control iterates converge linearly to the optimal control, by deriving representations and estimates of solutions to the adjoint backward stochastic differential equations. We introduce numerical algorithms that implement this method using deep learning and ordinary differential equation based techniques. These approaches enable high accuracy and scalability for stochastic control problems in higher dimensions. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the accuracy and validate the theoretical convergence guarantees of the algorithms."

Under the null hypothesis, the observed graph is drawn from a bipartite Erdős-Renyi distribution with connection probability $p_0$. Under the alternative hypothesis, there exists an unknown bipartite subgraph of size $k_1 \times k_2$ in which edges appear with probability $p_1 = p_0 + δ$ for some $δ> 0$, while all other edges outside the subgraph appear with probability $p_0$. Specifically, we provide non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the smallest signal strength $δ^*$ that is both necessary and sufficient to ensure the existence of a test with small enough type one and type two errors. We also derive novel minimax-optimal tests achieving these fundamental limits when the underlying graph is sufficiently dense. Our proposed tests involve a combination of hard-thresholded nonlinear statistics of the adjacency matrix, the analysis of which may be of independent interest. In contrast with previous work, our non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds match for any configuration of $n_1,n_2, k_1,k_2$."

Specifically, we establish the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) for optimal density control and construct the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation of the value functional through rigorous derivations without any concept from Wasserstein theory. To solve the density control problem numerically, we propose to use reduced-order models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), to parameterize the control vector-field and the adjoint function, which allows us to tackle problems defined on high-dimensional state spaces. We also prove several convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate promising performances of our algorithm on a variety of density control problems with obstacles and nonlinear interaction challenges in high dimensions."

While the free additive CLT has been thoroughly studied, including convergence rates, the multiplicative setting remained open in this regard. We consider products of the form $$ π_n^{g,n^{-1/2}x} := g\left(\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \cdots g\left(\frac{x_n}{\sqrt{n}}\right),$$ where $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are freely independent self-adjoint operators with common variance $σ^2$ and $g \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ satisfies certain regularity and integrability conditions. We quantify the deviation of the singular value distribution of $π_n^{g,x}$ from the free positive semicircular law, with bounds depending only on the moments of the underlying variables. Additionally, we present a combinatorial proof of the free multiplicative CLT that extends to the unbounded setting."

As examples, we give detailed descriptions of (1) the module of open Petri nets over undirected wiring diagrams and (2) the module of deterministic Moore machines over lenses. We define several pseudo-functorial constructions of modules of systems in the form of doctrines of systems theories. In particular, we introduce doctrines for port-plugging systems, variable sharing systems, and generalized Moore machines, each of which generalizes existing work in categorical systems theory. Finally, we observe how diagrammatic interaction patterns are free processes in particular doctrines."
2505.18324,Simple parallel estimation of the partition ratio for Gibbs distributions,"['math.PR', 'cs.DS']","['David G. Harris', 'Vladimir Kolmogorov']","We consider the problem of estimating the partition function $Z(β)=\sum_x \exp(β(H(x))$ of a Gibbs distribution with the Hamiltonian $H:Ω\rightarrow\{0\}\cup[1,n]$. As shown in [Harris & Kolmogorov 2024], the log-ratio $q=\ln (Z(β_{\max})/Z(β_{\min}))$ can be estimated with accuracy $ε$ using $O(\frac{q \log n}{ε^2})$ calls to an oracle that produces a sample from the Gibbs distribution for parameter $β\in[β_{\min},β_{\max}]$. That algorithm is inherently sequential, or {\em adaptive}: the queried values of $β$ depend on previous samples. Recently, [Liu, Yin & Zhang 2024] developed a non-adaptive version that needs $O( q (\log^2 n) (\log q + \log \log n + ε^{-2}) )$ samples.
  We improve the number of samples to $O(\frac{q \log^2 n}{ε^2})$ for a non-adaptive algorithm, and to $O(\frac{q \log n}{ε^2})$ for an algorithm that uses just two rounds of adaptivity (matching the complexity of the sequential version). Furthermore, our algorithm simplifies previous techniques. In particular, we use just a single estimator, whereas methods in [Harris & Kolmogorov 2024, Liu, Yin & Zhang 2024] employ two different estimators for different regimes."

We rephrase the structure-preserving strategy of Shiroto and Sentoku\cite{shiroto2019structure} in the language of numerical analysis, and extend it to the LDG framework. We propose a method that is not only conservative, but also stabilized through upwind flux. The apparent contradiction between conservation laws and numerical stabilization is elegantly resolved by leveraging the properties of the jump terms inherent to the LDG framework. In the numerical experiments, our scheme is tested with benchmark examples."

Our criterion involves the $L^2$ norm in time of the $L^\infty$ norm of the first order tangential derivatives. Moreover, it applies to various domains such as the full space, the half-space, torus, (in)finite channel, and domains with curved boundaries. Additionally, we provide a mixed criterion involving the $L^1_t L^\infty(Ω_1)$ norm of the vorticity and the $L^2_t L^\infty(Ω_2)$ norm of the first order conormal derivatives of the velocity where $Ω_1 \cup Ω_2 = Ω$ is a suitable decomposition of the physical space.

The method trains a neural network to approximate the two solution fields in a single stage, avoiding the use of nested time-stepping cycles that limit classical algorithms. For the decoupled case we prove a non-asymptotic error bound composed of an a posteriori residual plus the familiar square root dependence on the time step. Numerical experiments are consistent with this rate and reveal two key properties: \emph{scalability}, in the sense that accuracy remains stable from low dimension up to 500 spatial variables while GPU batching keeps wall-clock time nearly constant; and \emph{generality}, since the same method handles coupled systems whose forward dynamics depend on the backward solution. These results open practical access to a family of high-dimensional, time-inconsistent problems in stochastic control and quantitative finance."

2505.18205,Source identification via pathwise gradient estimation,"['math.OC', 'math.PR']","['Richard B. Lehoucq', 'Scott A. McKinley', 'Petr Plecháč']","In the context of PDE-constrained optimization theory, source identification problems traditionally entail particles emerging from an unknown source distribution inside a domain, moving according to a prescribed stochastic process, e.g.~Brownian motion, and then exiting through the boundary of a compact domain. Given information about the flux of particles through the boundary of the domain, the challenge is to infer as much as possible about the source.
  In the PDE setting, it is usually assumed that the flux can be observed without error and at all points on the boundary. Here we consider a different, more statistical presentation of the problem, in which the data has the form of discrete counts of particles arriving at a set of disjoint detectors whose union is a strict subset of the boundary. In keeping with the primacy of the stochastic processes in the generation of the model, we present a stochastic gradient descent algorithm in which exit rates and parameter sensitivities are computed by simulations of particle paths. We present examples for both Itô diffusion and piecewise-deterministic Markov processes, noting that the form of the sensitivities depends only on the parameterization of the source distribution and is universal among a large class of Markov processes."

By employing a reparameterization technique, we reformulate the cloud model as a stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) with a nonlinear transformation involving an absolute value. Under standard assumptions of stationarity, ergodicity, and an appropriate integrability condition, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a stationary solution. In particular, we demonstrate that the logarithmic moment of the model's coefficient, modeled as a standard normal random variable, is negative, thereby ensuring almost sure convergence. These results provide new insights into the stochastic stability of cloud models and offer a rigorous foundation for further theoretical and practical developments in uncertainty quantification."

From the demand management perspective, the problem is to determine an equilibrium distribution of departure times for which no user can reduce their generalized cost by changing their departure times unilaterally. This study introduces the departure time choice user equilibrium problem in public transport (DTUE-PT) for multi-line, schedule-based networks with hard train capacity constraints. We model the DTUE-PT problem as a Non-linear Mathematical Program problem (NMP) (minimizing the system gap) with a simulation model describing the complex system dynamics and passenger interactions. We develop an efficient, adaptive gap-based descent direction (AdaGDD) solution algorithm to solve the NMP problem. We validate the methodology on a multi-line public transport network with transfers by comparing with classical public transport assignment benchmark models, including Method of Successive Average (MSA) and day-to-day learning methods. The results show that the model can achieve a system gap ratio (the solution gap relative to the ideal least cost of an origin-destination option) of 0.1926, which significantly improves the solution performance from day-to-day learning (85%) and MSA (76%) algorithms. The sensitivity analysis highlights the solution stability of AdaGDD method over initial solution settings. The potential use of DTUE-PT model is demonstrated for evaluating the network design of Hong Kong mass transit railway network and can be easily extended to incorporate the route choice."
2505.18199,Closed Bounded Rational Framing Motions,['math.OC'],"['Hans-Peter Schröcker', 'Zbyněk Šír']","We present a method for constructing all bounded rational motions that frame a space curve $\mathbf{r}(t)$. This means that the motion guides an orthogonal frame along the curve such that one frame axis is in direction of the curve tangent. Existence of (bounded) framing motions is equivalent to $\mathbf{r}(t)$ being a (bounded) rational Pythagorean Hodograph curve. In contrast to previous constructions that rely on polynomial curves with smooth self-intersection, our motions and curves are infinitely differentiable. To this end, we develop the theory of Pythagorean hodograph curves parameterized over the projective line. We also provide a simple geometric necessary and sufficient condition on the spherical part of the motion, given by the homogeneous quaternionic preimage of the Pythagorean hodograph curve, that ensures the existence of a corresponding bounded, rational, and even regular framing motion. The translation part comes from the speed distribution, which must be a special positive rational function. This can in practice be ensured by semidefinite optimization methods. We illustrate our findings with a number of examples."

We introduce a simple and interpretable estimator that is comparable in ease of computation to classical correlation coefficients such as Pearson's, Spearman's, or Chatterjee's. Building on this coefficient, we develop a model-free variable selection algorithm, feature ordering by dependence (FORD), inspired by FOCI. FORD requires no tuning parameters and is provably consistent under suitable sparsity assumptions. We demonstrate its effectiveness and improvements over FOCI through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets."

They globalise topologically all coloured Jones polynomials for links with multi-colours bounded by $\mathscr N$ and all ADO polynomials with bounded colours. These invariants both come from the same weighted Lagrangian intersection supported on configurations on arcs and ovals in the disc. The question of providing a universal non semi-simple link invariant, recovering all the ADO polynomials was an open problem. A parallel question about semi-simple invariants for the case of knots is the subject of Habiro's famous universal knot invariant \cite{H3}. Habiro's universal construction is well defined for knots and can be extended just for certain classes of links. Our universal Jones link invariant is defined for any link and recovers all coloured Jones polynomials, providing a new semi-simple universal link invariant. The first non-semi simple universal link invariant that we construct unifies all ADO invariants for links, answering the open problem about the globalisation of these invariants. The geometrical origin of our construction provides a new topological perspective for the study of the asymptotics of these (non) semi-simple invariants, for which a purely topological $3$-dimensional description is a deep problem in quantum topology. Since our models are defined for links they open avenues for constructing universal invariants for three manifolds unifying the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant and the Costantino-Geer-Patureau invariants through purely geometrical lenses."
2505.18104,Zeta functions of K3 categories over finite fields,['math.AG'],"['Asher Auel', 'Jack Petok']","We define the zeta function of a noncommutative K3 surface over a finite field, an invariant under Fourier-Mukai equivalence that can be used to define point counts in this noncommutative setting. These point counts can be negative, and can be used as an obstruction to geometricity. In particular, we study the K3 category associated to a cubic fourfold over a finite field, and show that point counts can also fail to detect nongeometricity. We also study an analogue of Honda-Tate for K3 surfaces and for K3 categories, and provide a nontrivial restriction on the possible Weil polynomials of the K3 category of a cubic fourfold."

We assume that $σ$ and $q$ are \textit{a-priori} known to be a piecewise constant matrix-valued and scalar function, respectively, on a given partition of $Ω$ with curved interfaces. We prove that $σ$ and $q$ can be uniquely determined in $Ω$ from the knowledge of the local map."

2505.18054,Virtual retractions in free constructions,['math.GR'],"['Jon Merladet Urigüen', 'Ashot Minasyan']","A group $G$ has property (VRC) if every cyclic subgroup is a virtual retract. This property is stable under many standard group-theoretic constructions and is enjoyed by all virtually special groups (in the sense of Haglund and Wise). In this paper we study property (VRC) for fundamental groups of finite graphs of groups.
  Our main criterion shows that the fundamental group of a finite graph of finitely generated virtually abelian groups has (VRC) if and only if it has a homomorphism to a Euclidean-by-finite group that is injective on all vertex groups. This result allows us to determine property (VRC) for such groups using basic tools from Euclidean Geometry and Linear Algebra. We use it to produce examples and to give sufficient criteria for fundamental groups of finite graphs of finitely generated abelian groups with cyclic edge groups to have (VRC).
  In the last two sections and in the appendix we give applications of property (VRC). We show that if a fundamental group of a finite graph of groups with finitely generated virtually abelian vertex groups has (VRC) then it is CAT($0$). We also show that tubular groups with (VRC) are virtually free-by-cyclic and virtually special."
2505.18050,Inference of Substructured Reduced-Order Models for Dynamic Contact from Contact-free Simulations,['math.NA'],"['Diana Manvelyan-Stroot', 'Yevgeniya Filanova', 'Igor Pontes Duff', 'Peter Benner', 'Utz Wever']","In this paper, we propose an operator-inference-based reduction approach for contact problems, leveraging snapshots from simulations without active contact. Contact problems are solved using adjoint methods, by switching to the dual system, where the corresponding Lagrange multipliers represent the contact pressure. The Craig-Bampton-like substructuring method is incorporated into the inference process to provide the reduced system matrices and the coupling of the contact and interior nodes. The maximum possible set of contact nodes must be known a priori. Characteristic properties of the inferred matrices, such as symmetry and positive definiteness, are enforced by appending additional constraints to the underlying least-squares problem. The resulting dual system, which forms a linear complementarity problem, is well-defined and can be effectively solved using methods such as Lemke's algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is validated on three-dimensional finite element models."
2505.18042,A novel parameter-free and locking-free enriched Galerkin method for linear elasticity,['math.NA'],"['Shuai Su', 'Xiurong Yan', 'Qian Zhang']","We propose a novel parameter-free and locking-free enriched Galerkin (EG) method for solving the linear elasticity problem in both two and three dimensions. Unlike existing locking-free EG methods, our method enriches the first-order continuous Galerkin (CG) space with piecewise constants along edges in two dimensions or faces in three dimensions. This enrichment acts as a correction to the normal component of the CG space, ensuring the locking-free property and delivering an oscillation-free stress approximation without requiring post-processing. Our theoretical analysis establishes the well-posedness of the method and derives optimal error estimates. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method."
2505.18037,Efficient Conditional Gradient Methods for Solving Stochastic Convex Bilevel Optimization Problems,['math.OC'],"['Khanh-Hung Giang-Tran', 'Soroosh Shafiee', 'Nam Ho-Nguyen']","We propose efficient methods for solving stochastic convex bilevel optimization problems, where the goal is to minimize an outer stochastic objective function subject to the solution set of an inner stochastic optimization problem. Existing methods often rely on costly projection or linear optimization oracles over complex sets, which limits scalability. To overcome this, we propose an iteratively regularized conditional gradient framework that leverages efficient linear optimization oracles exclusively over the base feasible set. Our proposed methods employ a vanishing regularization sequence that progressively emphasizes the inner problem while biasing towards desirable minimal outer objective solutions. Under standard convexity assumptions, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates of $O(t^{-({1}/{2}-p)})$ for the outer objective and $O(t^{-p})$ for the inner objective, where $p \in (0,1/2)$ controls the regularization decay, in the one-sample stochastic setting, and $O(t^{-(1-p)})$ and $O(t^{-p})$ in the finite-sum setting using a mini-batch scheme, where $p \in (0,1)$. Experimental results on over-parametrized regression and $\ell_1$-constrained logistics regression tasks demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach over existing methods, confirming our theoretical findings."
2505.18009,Empathic network learning for multi-expert emergency decision-making under incomplete and inconsistent information,['math.OC'],"['Simin Shen', 'Zaiwu Gong', 'Bin Zhou', 'Roman Słowiński']","Challenges, such as a lack of information for emergency decision-making, time pressure, and limited knowledge of experts acting as decision-makers (DMs), can result in the generation of poor or inconsistent indirect information regarding DMs' preferences. Simultaneously, the empathic relationship represents a tangible social connection within the context of actual emergency decision-making, with the structure of the empathic network being a significant factor influencing the outcomes of the decision-making process. To deduce the empathic network underpinning the decision behaviors of DMs from incomplete and inconsistent preference information, we introduce an empathic network learning methodology rooted in the concept of robust ordinal regression via preference disaggregation. Firstly, we complete incomplete fuzzy judgment matrices including holistic preference information given in terms of decision examples on some reference alternatives, independently by each DM, and we calculate the intrinsic utilities of DMs. Secondly, we establish constraints for empathic network learning models based on empathic preference information and information about relations between some reference nodes. Then, the necessary and possible empathic relationships between any two DMs are calculated. Lastly, tailored to the specific requirements of different emergency scenarios, we design six target networks and construct models to derive the most representative empathic network."
2505.18008,Deep Operator Neural Network Model Predictive Control,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']","['Thomas Oliver de Jong', 'Khemraj Shukla', 'Mircea Lazar']","In this paper, we consider the design of model predictive control (MPC) algorithms based on deep operator neural networks (DeepONets). These neural networks are capable of accurately approximating real and complex valued solutions of continuous time nonlinear systems without relying on recurrent architectures. The DeepONet architecture is made up of two feedforward neural networks: the branch network, which encodes the input function space, and the trunk network, which represents dependencies on temporal variables or initial conditions. Utilizing the original DeepONet architecture as a predictor within MPC for Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) systems requires multiple branch networks, to generate multi output predictions, one for each input. Moreover, to predict multiple time steps into the future, the network has to be evaluated multiple times. Motivated by this, we introduce a multi step DeepONet (MS-DeepONet) architecture that computes in one shot multi step predictions of system outputs from multi step input sequences, which is better suited for MPC. We prove that the MS DeepONet is a universal approximator in terms of multi step sequence prediction. Additionally, we develop automated hyper parameter selection strategies and implement MPC frameworks using both the standard DeepONet and the proposed MS DeepONet architectures in PyTorch. The implementation is publicly available on GitHub. Simulation results demonstrate that MS-DeepONet consistently outperforms the standard DeepONet in learning and predictive control tasks across several nonlinear benchmark systems: the van der Pol oscillator, the quadruple tank process, and a cart pendulum unstable system, where it successfully learns and executes multiple swing up and stabilization policies."

If for some integer $d\geq 1$, we allow every neighbour in $B$ to have at most $d$ neighbours in $R$, and vice versa, we obtain the more general problem $d$-Cut. It is known that $d$-Cut is NP-complete for every $d\geq 1$. However, for claw-free graphs, it is only known that $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for $d=1$ and NP-complete for $d\geq 3$. We resolve the missing case $d=2$ by proving NP-completeness. This follows from our more general study, in which we also bound the maximum degree. That is, we prove that for every $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut, restricted to claw-free graphs of maximum degree $p$, is constant-time solvable if $p\leq 2d+1$ and NP-complete if $p\geq 2d+3$. Moreover, in the former case, we can find a $d$-cut in linear time. We also show how our positive results for claw-free graphs can be generalized to $S_{1^t,l}$-free graphs where $S_{1^t,l}$ is the graph obtained from a star on $t+2$ vertices by subdividing one of its edges exactly $l$ times."

Specifically we show that, if $n$ is sufficiently large and divisible by $k$, and $H$ has minimum positive codegree $δ^+(H) \geq \frac{k-1}{k}n - (k-2)$ and no isolated vertices, then $H$ contains a perfect matching. For $k=3$ this was previously established by Halfpap and Magnan, who also gave bounds for $k \geq 4$ which were tight up to an additive constant."

A sufficient condition called sequential tightness is formulated, which relaxes some assumptions for asymptotic tightness used in the Prokhorov -- Le Cam theorem. In the case where $\mathcal X$ is a compact geodesic metric space, sequential tightness gives means to characterize precompactness of collections of random curves on $\mathcal X$ in terms of an annulus crossing condition, which generalizes the one by Aizenman and Burchard by allowing estimates for annulus crossing probabilities to be non-uniform over the modulus of annuli."
2505.17969,A new class of finite difference methods: The zigzag schemes,['math.NA'],"['Lorenzo Poggioni', 'Didier Clamond', ""Yves D'Angelo""]","We introduce a novel class of finite difference approximations, termed zigzag schemes, that employ a hybrid stencil that is neither symmetrical, nor fully one-sided. These zigzag schemes often enjoy more permissive stability constraints and see their coefficients vanish as the order tends to infinity. This property permits the formulation of higher order schemes. An explicit formula is given for both collocated and staggered grids for an arbitrary order and a closed-form expression for the infinite-order scheme is also provided. A linear stability analysis indicates that the zigzag scheme offer a broader range of conditional stability compared to the centred and upwind schemes, sometimes being the only stable scheme. Additionally, the asymmetrical structure of the stencil of zigzag schemes prevents some issues such as the formation of ``ghost solutions''. Moreover, implementing zigzag schemes is relatively easy when a code using classical finite differences is available, that is an important feature for well-tested legacy codes. Overall, zigzag schemes provide a compelling alternative for finite differences methods by enabling faster and more stable numerical simulations without sacrificing accuracy or ease of use."

This paper contributes to a recent line of works which attempt to provide guarantees without making any variance assumption, leveraging only the (strong) convexity and smoothness of the loss functions. In this context, we prove new theoretical bounds derived from the monotonicity of a simple Lyapunov energy, improving the current state-of-the-art and extending their validity to larger step-sizes. Our theoretical analysis is backed by a Performance Estimation Problem analysis, which allows us to claim that, empirically, the bias term in our bounds is tight within our framework."

The time-dependent Brinkman equation describes the velocity field, incorporating permeability variations modeled as an exponential function of the product concentration. Density variations are accounted for using the Oberbeck-Boussinesq approximation, with density as a function of reactants and product concentration. The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions are established via the Galerkin approach, proving the system's well-posedness. A maximum principle ensures reactant nonnegativity with nonnegative initial conditions, while the product concentration is shown to be bounded, with an explicit upper bound derived in a simplified setting. Numerical simulations are performed using the finite element method to explore reactive fingering instabilities and illustrate the effects of density stratification, differential product mobility, and two- or three-dimensionality. Two cases with initial flat and elliptic interfaces further demonstrate the theoretical result that solutions continuously depend on initial and boundary conditions. These theoretical and numerical findings provide a foundation for understanding chemically induced fingering patterns and their implications in applications such as carbon dioxide sequestration, petroleum migration, and rock dissolution in karst reservoirs."
2505.17940,Counting quadratic points on Fano varieties,"['math.NT', 'math.AG']","['Francesca Balestrieri', 'Kevin Destagnol', 'Julian Lyczak', 'Jennifer Park', 'Nick Rome']","This paper initiates the systematic study of the number of points of bounded height on symmetric squares of weak Fano varieties. We provide a general framework for establishing the point count on $\text{Sym}^2 X$. In the specific case of surfaces, we relate this to the Manin--Peyre conjecture for $\text{Hilb}^2 X$, and prove the conjecture for an infinite family of non-split quadric surfaces. In order to achieve the predicted asymptotic, we show that a type II thin set of a new flavour must be removed.
  To establish our counting result for the specific family of surfaces, we generalise existing lattice point counting techniques to lattices defined over rings of integers. This reduces the dimension of the problem and yields improved error terms. Another key tool we develop is a collection of results for summing Euler products over quadratic extensions. We use this to show moments of $L$-functions at $s=1$ are constant on average in quadratic twist families."
2505.17938,LMask: Learn to Solve Constrained Routing Problems with Lazy Masking,"['math.OC', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']","['Tianyou Li', 'Haijun Zou', 'Jiayuan Wu', 'Zaiwen Wen']","Routing problems are canonical combinatorial optimization tasks with wide-ranging applications in logistics, transportation, and supply chain management. However, solving these problems becomes significantly more challenging when complex constraints are involved. In this paper, we propose LMask, a novel learning framework that utilizes dynamic masking to generate high-quality feasible solutions for constrained routing problems. LMask introduces the LazyMask decoding method, which lazily refines feasibility masks with the backtracking mechanism. In addition, it employs the refinement intensity embedding to encode the search trace into the model, mitigating representation ambiguities induced by backtracking. To further reduce sampling cost, LMask sets a backtracking budget during decoding, while constraint violations are penalized in the loss function during training to counteract infeasibility caused by this budget. We provide theoretical guarantees for the validity and probabilistic optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments on the traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) and TSP with draft limits (TSPDL) demonstrate that LMask achieves state-of-the-art feasibility rates and solution quality, outperforming existing neural methods."

Given the immunity status at the start of season $k$: $\textbf{p}^{(k)}$, describing community distribution of years since last infection, and their associated immunity levels $\boldsymbolι^{(k)}$, the outcome of the epidemic season $k$, characterized by the effective reproduction number $R_e^{(k)}$ and the fractions infected in the different immunity groups $\textbf{z}^{(k)}$, is determined by the random pair $(δ_k, τ_k)$. It is shown that the immunity status $(\textbf{p}^{(k)}, \boldsymbolι^{(k)})$, is an ergodic Markov chain, which converges to a stationary distribution $\bar π(\cdot) $. More analytical progress is made for the case where immunity only lasts for one season. We then characterize the stationary distribution of $p_1^{(k)}$, being identical to $z^{(k-1)}$. Further, we also characterize the stationary distribution of $(R_e^{(k)}, z^{(k)})$, and the conditional distribution of $z^{(k)}$ given $R_e^{(k)}$. The effective reproduction number $R_e^{(k)}$ is closely related to the initial exponential growth rate $ρ^{(k)}$ of the outbreak, a quantity which can be estimated early in the epidemic season. As a consequence, this conditional distribution may be used for predicting the final size of the epidemic based on its initial growth and immunity status."

In the case of doubles $Λ(L_1,L_2)$, if the sheaf moduli $\mathcal{M}_1(λ)$ admits a cluster structure, we introduce the notion of mutation distance and study its relationship with the isotopy class of the Legendrian surface. For twist spuns $Σ_\varphi(λ)$, when $\mathcal{M}_1(λ)$ admits a globally foldable cluster structure, we use the existence of a $\varphi$-symmetric filling of the Legendrian link to build a cluster structure on the sheaf moduli of the twist spun by folding. We then use that to motivate, and provide evidence for, conjectures on the number of embedded exact fillings of certain twist spuns. Further, we obstruct the exact fillability of certain twist spuns by analyzing fixed points of the cyclic shift action on Grassmanians."

We consider Lie groups with a fixed left-invariant metric and first observe that if the Lie group is unimodular, then every Lie subgroup is a minimal surface (hence a trivial solution). For this reason we focus on non-unimodular Lie groups, finding the evolution of every Lie subgroup of dimension 2 (within a 3 dimensional Lie group).

Each global contact is selected uniformly among all individuals and each local contact is selected uniformly among all other household members. The main focus is when all households have the same size $h \geq 2$, and the number of households is large. Large population properties of the model are derived including a central limit theorem for the final size of a major epidemic, the proof of which utilises an enhanced embedding argument. A modification of the epidemic model is considered where local contacts are replaced by global contacts independently with probability $p$. We then prove monotonicity results for the probability of the major outbreak and the limiting final fraction infected $z$ (conditioned on a major outbreak). a) The probability of a major outbreak is shown to be increasing in both $h$ and $p$ for any distribution of $X_L$. b) The final size $z$ increases monotonically with both $h$ and $p$ if the probability generating function (pgf) of $X_L$ is log-convex, which is satisfied by traditional household epidemic models where $X_L$ has a mixed-Poisson distribution. Additionally, we provide counter examples to b) when the pgf of $X_L$ is not log-convex."

The CBF-based controller design relies on the availability of a model to select feasible inputs from the set of CBF-based controls. In this paper, we develop a model-free approach to design CBF-based control laws, eliminating the need for knowledge of system dynamics or parameters. Specifically, we address safety requirements characterized by a time-varying distance to a reference trajectory in the output space and construct a CBF that depends only on the measured output. Utilizing this particular CBF, we determine a subset of CBF-based controls without relying on a model of the dynamics by using techniques from funnel control. The latter is a model-free high-gain adaptive control methodology, which achieves tracking guarantees via reactive feedback. In this paper, we discover and establish a connection between the modular controller synthesis via zeroing CBFs and model-free reactive feedback. The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical simulation."

  To achieve this, we combine rigidity results (previously proved for discrete groups by Bowen and Austin) with new constructions of explicit orbit equivalences between simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. In particular, we prove that for every pair of simply connected nilpotent Lie groups there is an $L^p$ orbit equivalence for some $p>0$, where we can choose $p>1$ if and only if the groups have isomorphic asymptotic cones. We also prove analogous results for lattices in simply connected nilpotent Lie groups. This yields a strong converse of Austin's Theorem that two nilpotent groups which are $L^1$ ME have isomorphic Carnot graded groups.
  We also address the much harder problem of extending this classification to $L^p$ ME for $p>1$: we obtain the first rigidity results, providing examples of nilpotent groups with isomorphic Carnot graded groups (hence $L^1$ OE) which are not $L^p$ ME for some finite (explicit) $p$.

This leads to an answer for a question posed by Deraux and Seshadri, and proves that an almost $1/4$-pinched metric constructed by the author in a previous article is not Kähler."
2505.17851,Optimal Decision Rules for Composite Binary Hypothesis Testing under Neyman-Pearson Framework,"['math.ST', 'cs.IT']","['Yanglei Song', 'Berkan Dulek', 'Sinan Gezici']","The composite binary hypothesis testing problem within the Neyman-Pearson framework is considered. The goal is to maximize the expectation of a nonlinear function of the detection probability, integrated with respect to a given probability measure, subject to a false-alarm constraint. It is shown that each power function can be realized by a generalized Bayes rule that maximizes an integrated rejection probability with respect to a finite signed measure. For a simple null hypothesis and a composite alternative, optimal single-threshold decision rules based on an appropriately weighted likelihood ratio are derived. The analysis is extended to composite null hypotheses, including both average and worst-case false-alarm constraints, resulting in modified optimal threshold rules. Special cases involving exponential family distributions and numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results."
2505.17849,A sparse $hp$-finite element method for piecewise-smooth differential equations with periodic boundary conditions,['math.NA'],"['Daniel VandenHeuvel', 'Sheehan Olver']","We develop an efficient $hp$-finite element method for piecewise-smooth differential equations with periodic boundary conditions, using orthogonal polynomials defined on circular arcs. The operators derived from this basis are banded and achieve optimal complexity regardless of $h$ or $p$, both for building the discretisation and solving the resulting linear system in the case where the operator is symmetric positive definite. The basis serves as a useful alternative to other bases such as the Fourier or integrated Legendre bases, especially for problems with discontinuities. We relate the convergence properties of these bases to regions of analyticity in the complex plane, and further use several differential equation examples to demonstrate these properties. The basis spans the low order eigenfunctions of constant coefficient differential operators, thereby achieving better smoothness properties for time-evolution partial differential equations."
2505.17845,A Vafa-Intriligator formula for semi-positive quotients of linear spaces,['math.AG'],['Riccardo Ontani'],"We consider genus zero quasimap invariants of smooth projective targets of the form $V/\!/G$, where $V$ is a representation of a reductive group $G$. In particular we consider integrals of cohomology classes arising as characteristic classes of the universal quasimap. In this setting, we provide a way to express the invariants of $V/\!/G$ in terms of invariants of $V/\!/T$, where $T$ is a maximal subtorus of $G$. Using this, we obtain residue formulae for such invariants as conjectured by Kim, Oh, Yoshida and Ueda. Finally, under some positivity assumptions on $V/\!/G$, we prove a Vafa-Intriligator formula for the generating series of such invariants, expressing them as finite sums of explicit contributions."
2505.17825,Perfect Matchings on Doubly Free Boundary Rail-Yard Graph with Macdonald Weights,['math.PR'],"['Zhongyang Li', 'Kaili Shi']","We investigate the asymptotic behavior of perfect matchings on rail-yard graphs with doubly free boundary conditions and Jack weights. While a special case of this model reduces to the half space Macdonald process with Jack weights introduced by Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin [3], the asymptotic behavior in the general Jack-weighted free boundary setting considered here has, to our knowledge, remained open in the literature; perhaps due to the absence of determinantal structure and the analytic complexity of boundary interactions that distinguish this setting from previously tractable cases. Our analysis is inspired by the asymptotic framework developed around the Negut operator by Gorin, Zhang, and Ahn, but it is adapted in new directions to address the challenges posed by the fully free boundary Jack-weighted regime. In particular, we establish novel identities for Macdonald polynomials and analyze infinite-product expansions not previously studied in this context. These tools enable us to rigorously establish the existence of a limit shape and to prove that the height fluctuations converge to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF) in the liquid region. These results, to the best of our knowledge, provide the first rigorous limit shape and fluctuation analysis in Jack-weighted tiling models with general free boundary conditions. In doing so, we expand the asymptotic theory of symmetric-function-deformed models beyond previously accessible, determinantal frameworks."
2505.17817,On the fragility of laminar flow,"['math.AP', 'physics.flu-dyn']","['Theodore D. Drivas', 'Daniel Ginsberg', 'Marc Nualart']","Inviscid laminar flow is a stationary solution of the incompressible Euler equations whose streamlines foliate the fluid domain. Their structure on symmetric domains is rigid: all laminar flows occupying straight periodic channels are shear and on regular annuli they are circular. Laminarity can persist to slight deformations of these domains provided the base flow is Arnold stable and non-stagnant (non-vanishing velocity). On the other hand, flows with trivial net momentum (and thus stagnate) break laminarity by developing islands (regions of contractible streamlines) on all non-flat periodic channels with up/down reflection symmetry. Here, we show that stable steady states occupying generic channels or annuli and stagnate must have islands. Additionally, when the domain is close to symmetric, we characterize the size of the islands, showing that they scale as the square root of the boundary's deviation from flat. Taken together, these results show that dynamically stable laminar flows are structurally unstable whenever they stagnate."

The upper bound is a familiar multiple of $\ln (p)$ and an $% l_{\infty }$ moment, as well as Kolmogorov distances based on Gaussian approximations $(ρ_{n},\tildeρ_{n})$, derived with and without negligible truncation and sub-sample blocking. The latter arise due to a departure from independence and therefore a departure from standard symmetrization arguments. Examples are provided demonstrating $(ρ_{n},% \tildeρ_{n})$ $\rightarrow $ $0$ under heterogeneous mixing and physical dependence conditions, where $(ρ_{n},\tildeρ_{n})$ are multiples of $\ln (p)/n^{b}$ for some $b$ $>$ $0$ that depends on memory, tail decay, the truncation level and block size."
2505.17753,Application of troubled-cells to finite volume methods -- an optimality study using a novel monotonicity parameter,['math.NA'],"['R Shivananda Rao', 'M Ramakrishna']","We adapt a troubled-cell indicator from discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods to finite volume methods (FVM) with MUSCL reconstruction and using a novel monotonicity parameter show there is a trade-off between convergence and quality of the solution. Employing two dimensional compressible Euler equations for flows with oblique shocks, this trade-off is studied by varying the number of troubled-cells systematically. An oblique shock is characterized primarily by the upstream Mach number, the shock angle $β$, and the deflection angle $θ$. We study these factors and their combinations and find that the degree of the shock misalignment with the grid determines the optimal number of troubled-cells. On each side of the shock, the optimal set consists of three troubled-cells for aligned shocks, and the troubled-cells identified by tracing the shock and four lines parallel to it, separated by the grid spacing, for nonaligned shocks. We show that the adapted troubled-cell indicator identifies a set of cells that is close to and contains the optimal set of cells for a threshold constant $K = 0.05$, and consequently, produces a solution close to that obtained by limiting everywhere, but with improved convergence."

2505.17751,Computational Math with Neural Networks is Hard,['math.NA'],"['Michael Feischl', 'Fabian Zehetgruber']","We show that under some widely believed assumptions, there are no higher-order algorithms for basic tasks in computational mathematics such as: Computing integrals with neural network integrands, computing solutions of a Poisson equation with neural network source term, and computing the matrix-vector product with a neural network encoded matrix. We show that this is already true for very simple feed-forward networks with at least three hidden layers, bounded weights, bounded realization, and sparse connectivity, even if the algorithms are allowed to access the weights of the network. The fundamental idea behind these results is that it is already very hard to check whether a given neural network represents the zero function. The non-locality of the problems above allow us to reduce the approximation setting to deciding whether the input is zero or not. We demonstrate sharpness of our results by providing fast quadrature algorithms for one-layer networks and giving numerical evidence that quasi-Monte Carlo methods achieve the best possible order of convergence for quadrature with neural networks."

The algebraic counterpart of these categories is the notion of a pre-Cartier quasi-bialgebra, which extends the well-known notion of quasitriangular quasi-bialgebra given by Drinfeld. Our result implies that one can quantize the infinitesimal $\mathcal{R}$-matrix of any Cartier quasi-bialgebra. We further discuss the emerging concepts of infinitesimal quantum Yang-Baxter equation and Cartier ring, the latter containing braid groups with additional generators that correspond to infinitesimal braidings. Explicit deformations of the representation categories of the gauge deformed quasitriangular quasi-bialgebras $E(n)$ are provided."

2505.17719,Stage-Parallel Implicit Runge--Kutta methods via low-rank matrix equation corrections,['math.NA'],"['Fabio Durastante', 'Mariarosa Mazza']","Implicit Runge--Kutta (IRK) methods are highly effective for solving stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) but can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems due to the need of solving coupled algebraic equations at each step. This study improves IRK efficiency by leveraging parallelism to decouple stage computations and reduce communication overhead, specifically we stably decouple a perturbed version of the stage system of equations and recover the exact solution by solving a Sylvester matrix equation with an explicitly known low-rank right-hand side. Two IRK families -- symmetric methods and collocation methods -- are analyzed, with extensions to nonlinear problems using a simplified Newton method. Implementation details, shared memory parallel code, and numerical examples, particularly for ODEs from spatially discretized PDEs, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed IRK technique."

This is a generalization of the concept of the core previously introduced by the first two authors. In the case where the distribution is the Levi null distribution of a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain $Ω\subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$, we prove that for $1 \leq q \leq n$, the support of the Grassmannian $q$-core satisfies Property $(P_q)$ if and only if the boundary of $Ω$ satisfies Property $(P_q)$. This generalizes a previous result of the third author in the case $q=1$. The notion of the Grassmannian $q$-core offers a perspective on certain generalized stratifications appearing in a recent work of Zaitsev."

To resolve the difficulties caused by the leading variable-exponent operator, we adopt the convolution method to reformulate the model into an equivalent but more tractable form, and then prove the well-posedness and weighted regularity of the optimal control. As the convolution kernels in reformulated models are indefinite-sign, non-positive-definite, and non-monotonic, we adopt the discrete convolution kernel approach in numerical analysis to show the $O(τ(1+|\lnτ|)+h^2)$ accuracy of the schemes for state and adjoint equations. Numerical experiments are performed to substantiate the theoretical findings."

Henning', 'Dimbinaina Ralaivaosaona']","A set $S$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a paired dominating set if every vertex of $G$ is adjacent to a vertex in $S$ and the subgraph induced by $S$ contains a perfect matching (not necessarily as an induced subgraph). The paired domination number, $γ_{\mathrm{pr}}(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a paired dominating set of $G$. We present a linear algorithm for computing the paired domination number of a tree. As an application of our algorithm, we prove that the paired domination number is asymptotically normal in a random rooted tree of order $n$ generated by a conditioned Galton-Watson process as $n\to\infty$. In particular, we have found that the paired domination number of a random Cayley tree of order $n$, where each tree is equally likely, is asymptotically normal with expectation approaching $(0.5177\ldots)n$."

This result generalizes and strengthens Zimmer's theorem, which characterizes minimal Lie foliations with leaves isometric to a symmetric space of non-compact type without real rank one factors as pullbacks of homogeneous foliations. As applications, we extend Zimmer's arithmeticity theorem for holonomy groups and establish a rigidity theorem for Riemannian foliations with locally symmetric leaves."

A new skew generalized constant Cp(λ,μ,X) based on C(X) constant is given in this paper. First, we will obtain some basic properties of this new constant. Moreover, some relations between this new constant and other constants are investigated. Specially, with the Banach-Mazur distance, we use this new constant to study isomorphic Banach spaces. Ultimately, by leveraging the connection between the newly introduced constant and the weak orthogonality coefficient ω(X), a sufficient condition for normal structure is established."

It is shown that under some (sufficient and necessary) conditions, these methods attain the same order as their standard counterparts - to prove this statement, a nonstandard version of Taylor's series is constructed. The preservation of some qualitative properties (boundedness, a weak form of monotonicity, and the linear combination of the components) is also proven for all step sizes. The methods are applied to a one-dimensional equation and a system of equations, in which the numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results."

Through the incorporation of suitable parameters, we have successfully generalized the aforementioned constant into two novel forms of geometric constants, which are denoted as T1(λ,μ,X ) and T2(\k{appa},τ,X ). First, we obtained some basic properties of these two constants, such as the upper and lower bounds. Next, these two constants served as the basis for our characterization of Hilbert spaces. More significantly, our findings reveal that these two constants exhibit a profound and intricate interrelation with other well-known constants in Banach spaces. Finally, we characterized uniformly non-square spaces by means of these two constants."

We present two main algorithms, namely DFMOnew and DFMOlight which are based on a linesearch expansion technique. In particular, \DFMOnew, requires a complete exploration of the points in the current set of non-dominated solutions, whereas DFMOlight only requires the exploration around a single point in the set of non-dominated solutions. For these algorithms, we derive worst case iteration and evaluation complexity results. In particular, the complexity results for DFMOlight aligns with those recently proved in the literature for a directional multisearch method. Furthermore, exploiting an expansion technique of the step, we are also able to give further complexity results concerning the number of iterations with a measure of stationarity above a prefixed tolerance."

The models studied take into account the complex threshold rheology of these flows, as well as the dilatance effects. It is the coupling of these two physical phenomena that ensures stability and the existence of dissipated energy. The key point of the article is to understand how this energy can ensure the existence of a weak solution.

2505.17569,Cubic graphs of colouring defect 3 and conjectures of Berge and Alon-Tarsi,['math.CO'],"['Ján Karabáš', 'Edita Máčajová', 'Roman Nedela', 'Martin Škoviera']","We study two measures of uncolourability of cubic graphs, their colouring defect and perfect matching index. The colouring defect of a cubic graph $G$ is the smallest number of edges left uncovered by three perfect matchings; the perfect matching index of $G$ is the smallest number of perfect matchings that together cover all edges of $G$. We provide a complete characterisation of cubic graphs with colouring defect $3$ whose perfect matching index is greater or equal to $5$. The result states that every such graph arises from the Petersen graph with a fixed $6$-cycle $C$ by substituting edges or vertices outside $C$ with suitable $3$-edge-colourable cubic graphs. Our research is motivated by two deep and long-standing conjectures, Berge's conjecture stating that five perfect matchings are enough to cover the edges of any bridgeless cubic graph and the shortest cycle cover conjecture of Alon and Tarsi suggesting that every bridgeless graph can have its edges covered with cycles of total length at most $7/5\cdot m$, where $m$ is the number of edges. We apply our characterisation to showing that every cubic graph with colouring defect $3$ admits a cycle cover of length at most $4/3\cdot m +1$, where $m$ is the number of edges, the bound being achieved by the graphs whose perfect matching index equals $5$. We further prove that every snark containing a $5$-cycle with an edge whose endvertices removed yield a $3$-edge-colourable graph has a cycle cover of length at most $4/3\cdot m+1$, as well."

2505.17563,Category $\mathcal{O}$ for Lie superalgebras,['math.RT'],"['Chun-Ju Lai', 'Daniel K. Nakano', 'Arik Wilbert']","The authors define a Category $\mathcal{O}$ for any quasi-reductive Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with respect to a triangular decomposition. This much needed approach unifies many important constructions in the existing literature in a rigorous fashion. Our Category $\mathcal{O}$ encompasses all highest weight categories for Lie (super)algebras as well as specific examples which may not be highest weight categories. When the decomposition arises from a principal parabolic subalgebra $\mathfrak{p}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ exhibits rich homological properties. For one, the authors show that in contrast to the case of a semisimple Lie algebra, the Category $\mathcal{O}$ is standardly stratified. Moreover, the categorical cohomology of $\mathcal{O}$ is a finitely generated ring. This provides a first step towards developing a support variety theory for Category $\mathcal{O}$. Finally, it is shown that the complexity of modules in Category $\mathcal{O}$ is finite with an explicit upper bound given by the dimension of the subspace of the odd degree elements in $\mathfrak{g}$. This upgrades results known for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ to the more general setting. Our arguments are based on foundational connections between the categorical cohomology and the relative Lie superalgebra cohomology as well as the interplay between Category $\mathcal{O}$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ and the Category $\mathcal{O}$ for its corresponding Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\bar 0}$."

A closed range property is proved, which induces $L^2$-stability estimates. We then characterize the null space by introducing the concept of conservative third-order tensor field.

2505.17523,Cones of Weights and Minimal Cones of the Goren-Oort Strata in Hilbert modular varieties,['math.NT'],"['Fred Diamond', 'Payman L Kassaei']","Let $p$ be a prime, $F$ a totally real field in which $p$ is unramified, and $X/\overline{\mathbb{F}}_p$ a Shimura variety associated to ${\rm Res}_{F/\mathbb{Q}} {\rm GL}_2$ (or a PEL Hilbert modular variety). A mod $p$ Hilbert modular form of weight $κ$ can be defined as a section of an automorphic line bundle $\mathcal{L}_κ$ on $X$. We consider sections of $\mathcal{L}_κ$ (forms) over a Goren-Oort stratum $X_T$ inside $X$, and define the cone of weights of $X_T$ to be the $\mathbb{Q}^{\geq 0}$-cone generated by the weights of all nonzero forms on $X_T$. We explicitly determine the cone of weights of all strata, showing in particular that they are not in general generated by the weights of the associated Hasse invariants. Using this, we define a notion of minimal cone for each stratum, and explicitly determine the minimal cones of all strata. When $X$ is a Shimura variety associated to ${\rm Res}_{F/\mathbb{Q}} {\rm GL}_2$, we prove that for every nonzero eigenform $f$ for the prime-to-$p$ Hecke algebra on a stratum $X_T$, there is another eigenform with the same Hecke eigenvalues which has weight in the minimal cone of $X_T$."
2505.17504,The GMRES method for solving the large indefinite least squares problem via an accelerated preconditioner,['math.NA'],"['Jun Li', 'Lingsheng Meng']","In this research, to solve the large indefinite least squares problem, we firstly transform its normal equation into a sparse block three-by-three linear systems, then use GMRES method with an accelerated preconditioner to solve it. The construction idea of the preconditioner comes from the thought of Luo et.al [Luo, WH., Gu, XM., Carpentieri, B., BIT 62, 1983-2004(2022)], and the advantage of this is that the preconditioner is closer to the coefficient matrix of the block three-by-three linear systems when the parameter approachs zero. Theoretically, the iteration method under the preconditioner satisfies the conditional convergence, and all eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are real numbers and gathered at point $(1,0)$ as parameter is close to $0$. In the end, numerical results reflect that the theoretical results is correct and the proposed preconditioner is effective by comparing with serval existing preconditioners."

2505.17480,Alpay Algebra II: Identity as Fixed-Point Emergence in Categorical Data,['math.GM'],['Faruk Alpay'],"In this second installment of the Alpay Algebra framework, I formally define identity as a fixed point that emerges through categorical recursion. Building upon the transfinite operator $\varphi^\infty$, I characterize identity as the universal solution to a self-referential functorial equation over a small cartesian closed category. I prove the existence and uniqueness of such identity-fixed-points via ordinal-indexed iteration, and interpret their convergence through internal categorical limits. Functors, adjunctions, and morphisms are reconstructed as dynamic traces of evolving states governed by $\varphi$, reframing identity not as a static label but as a stabilized process. Through formal theorems and symbolic flows, I show how these fixed points encode symbolic memory, recursive coherence, and semantic invariance. This paper positions identity as a mathematical structure that arises from within the logic of change itself computable, convergent, and categorically intrinsic."

2505.17463,Multi-cut stochastic approximation methods for solving stochastic convex composite optimization,['math.OC'],"['Jiaming Liang', 'Renato D. C. Monteiro', 'Honghao Zhang']","The development of a multi-cut stochastic approximation (SA) method for solving stochastic convex composite optimization (SCCO) problems has remained an open challenge. The difficulty arises from the fact that the stochastic multi-cut model, constructed as the pointwise maximum of individual stochastic linearizations, provides a biased estimate of the objective function, with the error being uncontrollable. This paper introduces multi-cut SA methods for solving SCCO problems, achieving near-optimal convergence rates. The cutting-plane models used in these methods are the pointwise maxima of appropriately chosen one-cut models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first multi-cut SA methods specifically designed for SCCO problems. Finally, computational experiments demonstrate that these methods generally outperform both the robust stochastic approximation method and the stochastic dual averaging method across all instances tested."

Other examples include categories of Hilbert W*-modules and of unitary group-representations. M*-categories are ""analytically"" complete in two ways: every bounded increasing sequence of Hermitian endomorphisms has a supremum, and every suitably bounded orthogonal family of parallel morphisms is summable. These ""analytic"" completeness properties are not assumed outright; rather, they are derived, respectively, from two new universal constructions: codirected $\ell^2$-limits of contractions and $\ell^2$-products. In turn, these universal constructions are built from directed colimits in the wide subcategory of isometries."

Forests are exactly $(1,-1)$-sparse multigraphs. It is known that the vertex set of any $(2,-1)$-sparse multigraph can be partitioned into two parts each of which induces a forest.
  For a given parameter $D$ we study for which pairs $(a,b)$ every $(a,b)$-sparse multigraph $G$ admits a vertex partition $(V_1, V_2)$ of $V(G)$ such that $G[V_1]$ and $G[V_2]$ are forests, and in addition either (i) $Δ(G[V_1])\leq D$ or (ii) every component of $G[V_1]$ has at most $D$ edges.

Our results for the finite case focus on the involution theorem for finite Hecke algebras that appear in Howlett-Lehrer's theory, where they proved a version for characters of certain subgroups of a Weyl group. We hope that our results will serve as a stepping stone for the study of involution for an arbitrary Bernstein block in the p-adic reductive group case. We also prove their compatibility with the Alvis-Curtis-Kawanaka duality (Aubert-Zelevinsky duality) when restricted to some Harish-Chandra series (resp. Bernstein blocks).

We begin by analyzing the sequential estimation problem in the single-arm setting, focusing on cumulative mean-squared error. We show that Lasso estimators are provably suboptimal in the sequential setting, exhibiting suboptimal dependence on $d$ and $T$, whereas thresholded Lasso estimators -- obtained by applying least squares to the support selected by thresholding an initial Lasso estimator -- achieve the minimax rate. Building on these insights, we consider the full linear contextual bandit problem and propose a three-stage arm selection algorithm that uses thresholded Lasso as the main estimation method. We derive an upper bound on the cumulative regret of order $s(\log s)(\log d + \log T)$, and establish a matching lower bound up to a $\log s$ factor, thereby characterizing the minimax regret rate up to a logarithmic term in $s$. Moreover, when a short initial period is excluded from the regret, the proposed algorithm achieves exact minimax optimality."

Among them, we provide simple proofs of two celebrated results of Minh and Trung, Varbaro, and Terai and Trung elegantly characterizing the Cohen-Macaulay property, or even Serre's condition $(S_2)$, of symbolic and ordinary powers of squarefree monomial ideals in terms of their combinatorial (matroidal) structure.

Subsequently, the Newton's method is employed to update the non-active variables, while the proximal gradient method is utilized to update the active variables. If the Newton's method fails, we use the proximal gradient step to update all variables. Under some mild conditions, we prove the global convergence and the local quadratic convergence rate.

In this paper, $χ_S$-critical graphs are introduced as the graphs $G$ such that $χ_S(H) < χ_S(G)$ for each proper subgraph $H$ of $G$. Several families of $χ_S$-critical graphs are constructed, and $2$- and $3$-colorable $χ_S$-critical graphs are presented for all packing sequences $S$, while $4$-colorable $χ_S$-critical graphs are found for most of $S$. Cycles which are $χ_S$-critical are characterized under different conditions. It is proved that for any graph $G$ and any edge $e \in E(G)$, the inequality $χ_S(G - e) \ge χ_S(G)/2$ holds. Moreover, in several important cases, this bound can be improved to $χ_S(G - e) \ge (χ_S(G)+1)/2$. The sharpness of the bounds is also discussed.

In particular, Erdős and Sós asked to determine the uniform Turán densities of the hypergraphs $K_4^{(3)-}$ and $K_4^{(3)}$. After more than 30 years, the former was solved by Glebov, Král' and Volec [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349-366] and Reiher, Rödl and Schacht [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139-1159], while the latter still remains open. In these two cases and several additional cases, the tight lower bounds are provided by a so-called palette construction.
  Lamaison [arXiv:2408.09643] has recently showed that the uniform Turán density of a 3-uniform hypergraph H is equal to the supremum of the densities of palettes that H is not colorable with. We give a necessary and sufficient condition, which is easy to verify, on the existence of a 3-uniform hypergraph colorable by a set of palettes and not colorable by another given set of palettes. We also demonstrate how our result can be used to prove the existence of 3-uniform hypergraphs with specific values of the uniform Turán density."

These additions have the aim of reintroducing contributions that in standard reduced-order approaches are not taken into account. In particular, in this work we focus on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-based formulation and our goal is to build a closure or correction model, aimed to re-introduce the contribution of the discarded modes. The approach has been investigated in previous works, and the goal of this manuscript is to extend the model to a parametric setting making use of machine learning procedures, and, in particular, of deep operator networks. More in detail, we model the closure terms through a deep operator network taking as input the reduced variables and the parameters of the problem. We tested the methods on three test cases with different behaviors: the periodic turbulent flow past a circular cylinder, the unsteady turbulent flow in a channel-driven cavity, and the geometrically-parametrized backstep flow. The performance of the machine learning-enhanced ROM is deeply studied in different modal regimes, and considerably improved the pressure and velocity accuracy with respect to the standard POD-Galerkin approach."

These are simplified models for interface motion in heterogeneous media, particularly capillary contact lines. The homogenization limit reveals a pinning effect at zero tangential slope, leading to a novel singularly anisotropic pinned Neumann condition. The singular pinning creates an unconstrained contact set, generalizing the contact set in the classical thin obstacle problem. We establish a comparison principle for the heat equation with this new type of boundary condition. The comparison principle enables a proof of homogenization via the method of half-relaxed limits from viscosity solution theory. Our work also demonstrates, for the first time in a PDE problem in multiple dimensions, the emergence of rate-independent pinning from gradient flows with wiggly energies. Prior limit theorems of this type, in rate-independent contexts, were limited to ODEs and PDEs in one dimension."

However, just using the triangulated structure on the derived category is not enough to obtain this refinement.

Our goal is to learn the optimal dynamic treatment regime (DTR) from longitudinal patient data. When both the number of stages and the number of treatment levels per stage are arbitrary, estimating the optimal DTR reduces to a sequential, weighted, multiclass classification problem (Kosorok and Laber, 2019). In this paper, we aim to solve this classification problem simultaneously across all stages using Fisher consistent surrogate losses. Although computationally feasible Fisher consistent surrogates exist in special cases, e.g., the binary treatment setting, a unified theory of Fisher consistency remains largely unexplored. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for DTR Fisher consistency within the class of non-negative, stagewise separable surrogate losses. To our knowledge, this is the first result in the DTR literature to provide necessary conditions for Fisher consistency within a non-trivial surrogate class. Furthermore, we show that many convex surrogate losses fail to be Fisher consistent for the DTR classification problem, and we formally establish this inconsistency for smooth, permutation equivariant, and relative-margin-based convex losses. Building on this, we propose SDSS (Simultaneous Direct Search with Surrogates), which uses smooth, non-concave surrogate losses to learn the optimal DTR. We develop a computationally efficient, gradient-based algorithm for SDSS. When the optimization error is small, we establish a sharp upper bound on SDSS's regret decay rate. We evaluate the numerical performance of SDSS through simulations and demonstrate its real-world applicability by estimating optimal fluid resuscitation strategies for severe septic patients using electronic health record data."

We present a non-commutative Gröbner basis for the Fermi-Dirac algebra; offering an alternative proof of Wick's theorem, a fundamental result in quantum field theory. In coupled cluster theory, eigenpairs of the Schrödinger equation are approximated by a hierarchy of polynomial equations corresponding to different levels of truncation. The coupled cluster exponential parameterization of quantum states gives rise to Fock space truncation varieties. This reveals well-known varieties, such as the Grassmannian, flag varieties and spinor varieties. We offer a detailed study of the truncation varieties, providing an explicit description of their defining equations and dimension. Furthermore, we classify all cases in which their coupled cluster degree coincides with the degree of the graph of the exponential parameterization - most notably for singleton truncations such as CCD and for the Schubert like truncation varieties such as the Grassmannian, flag variety and the spinor variety."

Beyond feasibility, P-CRM solves the best approximation problem for any finite collection of affine subspaces; that is, it not only finds a feasible point but directly computes the projection of an initial point onto the intersection. Within a fully self-contained scheme, we also introduce the Framework for the Simultaneous Projection Method (F-SPM) which includes Cimmino's method as a special case. Theoretical results show that both P-CRM and F-SPM achieve linear convergence. Moreover, P-CRM converges at a rate that is at least as fast as, and potentially superior to, the best convergence rate of F-SPM. As a byproduct, this also yields a new and simplified convergence proof for Cimmino's method. Numerical experiments show that P-CRM is competitive compared to CRM and indicate that it offers a scalable and flexible alternative, particularly suited for large-scale problems and modern computing environments."

The approach: i) ensures passive safety and satisfies path constraints at all times, ii) meets the specifications for critical decision points along the trajectory, iii) accounts for uncertainties that are common in real-world operation, such as due to orbital insertion, actuation, and navigation measurement, via chance constraints and utilizes a stabilizing feedback controller to bound the effect of uncertainties. We leverage sequential convex programming (SCP) and isoperimetric reformulation of path constraints, including passive safety, to eliminate the risk of inter-sample constraint violations that is common in existing methods. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a realistic simulation of a rendezvous to the Gateway."

We construct piecewise polynomial finite element spaces for all of the natural subspaces of the space of $(p,q)$-forms, excluding one subspace which fails to admit a piecewise constant discretization. As special cases, our construction recovers known finite element spaces for symmetric matrices with tangential-tangential continuity (the Regge finite elements), symmetric matrices with normal-normal continuity, and trace-free matrices with normal-tangential continuity. It also gives rise to new spaces, like a finite element space for tensors possessing the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor."

Among desirable analytical properties for such systems of equations are hyperbolicity, accuracy, correct momentum equation, and interpretable steady states. In this paper, we show analytically that existing models fail at different of these properties and we derive new models overcoming the disadvantages. This is made possible by performing a hyperbolic regularization not in the convective variables (as done in the existing models) but in the primitive variables. Via analytical transformations between the convective and primitive system, we can prove hyperbolicity and compute analytical steady states of the new models. Simulating a dam-break test case, we demonstrate the accuracy of the new models and show that it is essential for accuracy to preserve the momentum equation."
2505.17193,On the distinguishing chromatic number in hereditary graph classes,['math.CO'],"['Christoph Brause', 'Rafał Kalinowski', 'Monika Pilśniak', 'Ingo Schiemeyer']","The distinguishing chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $χ_D(G)$, is the minimum number of colours in a proper vertex colouring of $G$ that is preserved by the identity automorphism only. Collins and Trenk proved that $χ_D(G)\le 2Δ(G)$ for any connected graph $G$, and the equality holds for complete balanced bipartite graphs $K_{p,p}$ and for $C_6$. In this paper, we show that the upper bound on $χ_D(G)$ can be substantially reduced if we forbid some small graphs as induced subgraphs of $G$, that is, we study the distinguishing chromatic number in some hereditary graph classes."
2505.17191,An Adaptive-rank Approach with Greedy Sampling for Multi-scale BGK Equations,['math.NA'],"['William A. Sands', 'Jing-Mei Qiu', 'Daniel Hayes', 'Nanyi Zheng']","In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive-rank method for simulating multi-scale BGK equations, based on a greedy sampling strategy. The method adaptively selects important rows and columns of the solution matrix and updates them using a local semi-Lagrangian solver. An adaptive cross approximation then reconstructs the full solution matrix. This extends our prior semi-Lagrangian adaptive-rank framework, developed for the Vlasov-Poisson system, to nonlinear collisional kinetic equations. Unlike step-and-truncate low-rank integrators, our greedy sampling approach avoids explicit low-rank decompositions of nonlinear terms, such as the local Maxwellian in the BGK operator. To ensure conservation, we introduce a locally macroscopic conservative correction that implicitly couples the kinetic and macroscopic systems, enforcing mass, momentum, and energy conservation. Through asymptotic analysis, we show that this correction preserves the full-grid scheme's asymptotic behavior, and that the proposed method is conditionally asymptotic-preserving in the low-rank setting. A key advantage of our approach is its use of a local semi-Lagrangian solver, which allows large time steps. This flexibility is retained in the macroscopic solver using high-order stiffly accurate diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods. The resulting nonlinear systems are solved efficiently using a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method, avoiding the need for preconditioning at modest CFL numbers. Each nonlinear iteration provides a self-consistent correction to a provisional kinetic solution, which serves as a dynamic closure for the macroscopic model. Numerical results demonstrate the method's accuracy in capturing shocks and its robustness across mixed-regime problems with wide-ranging Knudsen numbers."

  By applying integrals of motion associated with the Loewner evolution, we show that, in the $\mathbb{H}$-uniformization with the marked point $q = \infty$, the traces of type $(n, m)$ multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems correspond to the real locus of real rational functions with $n$ real simple critical points, $m$ simple poles, and a pole of order $n - 2m + 1$ at infinity.

We use this tool to fill the gaps in characterization of pairs of power series spaces, adding to the previously established results of Dubinsky, Vogt, Nyberg and etc., and summarize this complete characterization in Table 1. As a result, we also show that the range of every continuous tame operator defined between power series spaces of infinite type has a basis."

Unlike the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method, this kind of MesoNM is an EDF-based mesoscopic finite-difference (MesoFD) method, and by taking the moments of the MesoFD scheme, its macroscopic version, called MMFD method, can be derived directly. Both MesoFD scheme and MMFD schemes are multi-level FD methods, MesoFD scheme being mesoscopic, and MMFD scheme being its macroscopic form which has the form of the central FD scheme. They are unified FD schemes for PDEs and can be in implicit or explicit forms as needed. The macroscopic moment equations (MEs) can be derived from the MesoFD or MMFD scheme through the Taylor expansion method, and the common PDEs can be recovered from the MEs by using the direct Taylor expansion method. Moreover, the stability of the MMFD scheme is analyzed for linear CDE and liner wave equation with anisotropic diffusion, and the stability conditions of a two-level explicit MMFD scheme, a two-level $θ$-MMFD scheme (hybrid explicit and implicit MMFD scheme), and a three-level MMFD scheme are obtained, respectively. Finally, we note that some existing lattice Boltzmann (LB) based macroscopic FD models for the NSEs and NCDE are the special cases of present MMFD, which can be considered as a unified framework of FD schemes for PDEs, from this point of view."

Traditional numerical methods, while effective in low-dimensional settings or on coarse grids, often struggle to deliver the precision required in practical applications. Recent machine learning-based approaches offer flexibility but frequently fall short in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in industrial contexts. In this work, we explore a quantum-inspired method based on quantized tensor trains (QTT), enabling efficient and accurate solutions to PDEs in a variety of challenging scenarios. Through several representative examples, we demonstrate that the QTT approach can achieve logarithmic scaling in both memory and computational cost for linear and nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, we introduce a novel technique for data-driven learning within the quantum-inspired framework, combining the adaptability of neural networks with enhanced accuracy and reduced training time."

The model does not rely on the asymptotic expansion of the Coriolis force and extends the quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere by including an additional transported buoyancy field acting as a source term for the potential vorticity. We give its Hamiltonian description in terms of semidirect product Lie--Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws, Casimirs, parameterized by two arbitrary smooth functions. A structure-preserving discretization is provided based on Zeitlin's self-consistent matrix approximation for hydrodynamics. A Casimir-preserving time integrator is employed to numerically fully preserve the resulting finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson structure. Simulations reveal the formation of vorticity and buoyancy fronts, and large-scale structures in the buoyancy dynamics induced by the buoyancy-bathymetry interaction."

Montanari', 'Fabio Pasqualetti', 'Adilson E. Motter']","Oscillator Ising machines (OIMs) are networks of coupled oscillators that seek the minimum energy state of an Ising model. Since many NP-hard problems are equivalent to the minimization of an Ising Hamiltonian, OIMs have emerged as a promising computing paradigm for solving complex optimization problems that are intractable on existing digital computers. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of tunable parameters, and convergence guarantees are mostly lacking. Here, we show that lower energy states are more likely to be stable, and that convergence to the global minimizer is often improved by introducing random heterogeneities in the regularization parameters. Our analysis relates the stability properties of Ising configurations to the spectral properties of a signed graph Laplacian. By examining the spectra of random ensembles of these graphs, we show that the probability of an equilibrium being asymptotically stable depends inversely on the value of the Ising Hamiltonian, biasing the system toward low-energy states. Our numerical results confirm our findings and demonstrate that heterogeneously designed OIMs efficiently converge to globally optimal solutions with high probability."
2505.17025,Locally Adaptive Non-Hydrostatic Shallow Water Extension for Moving Bottom-Generated Waves,"['math.NA', 'physics.flu-dyn']","['Kemal Firdaus', 'Jörn Behrens']","We propose a locally adaptive non-hydrostatic model and apply it to wave propagation generated by a moving bottom. This model is based on the non-hydrostatic extension of the shallow water equations (SWE) with a quadratic pressure relation, which is suitable for weakly dispersive waves. The approximation is mathematically equivalent to the Green-Naghdi equations. Applied globally, the extension requires solving an elliptic system of equations in the whole domain at each time step. Therefore, we develop an adaptive model that reduces the application area of the extension and by that the computational time. The elliptic problem is only solved in the area where the dispersive effect might play a crucial role. To define the non-hydrostatic area, we investigate several potential criteria based on the hydrostatic SWE solution. We validate and illustrate how our adaptive model works by first applying it to simulate a simple propagating solitary wave, where exact solutions are known. Following that, we demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach in more complicated cases involving moving bottom-generated waves, where measured laboratory data serve as reference solutions. The adaptive model yields similar accuracy as the global application of the non-hydrostatic extension while reducing the computational time by more than 50%."

However, g-convexity lacks many desirable properties satisfied by Euclidean convexity. For instance, the natural notions of half-spaces and affine functions are themselves not g-convex. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the oracle complexity of geodesically convex optimization necessarily depends on the curvature of the manifold (Criscitiello and Boumal, 2022; Criscitiello and Boumal, 2023; Hamilton and Moitra, 2021), a computational bottleneck for several problems, e.g., tensor scaling. Recently, Lewis et al. (2024) addressed this challenge by proving curvature-independent convergence of subgradient descent, assuming horospherical convexity of the objective's sublevel sets. Using a similar idea, we introduce a generalization of convex functions to Hadamard manifolds, utilizing horoballs and Busemann functions as building blocks (as proxies for half-spaces and affine functions). We refer to this new notion as horospherical convexity (h-convexity). We provide algorithms for both nonsmooth and smooth h-convex optimization, which have curvature-independent guarantees exactly matching those from Euclidean space; this includes generalizations of subgradient descent and Nesterov's accelerated method. Motivated by applications, we extend these algorithms and their convergence rates to minimizing a sum of horospherically convex functions, assuming access to a weighted-Fréchet-mean oracle."
2505.16960,Rank one elliptic curves and rank stability,['math.NT'],['David Zywina'],"For any quadratic extension $L/K$ of number fields, we prove that there are infinitely many elliptic curves $E$ over $K$ so that the abelian groups $E(K)$ and $E(L)$ both have rank $1$. In particular, there are infinitely many elliptic curves of rank $1$ over any number field. This result generalizes theorems of Koymans-Pagano and Alpöge-Bhargava-Ho-Shnidman which were used to independently show that Hilbert's tenth problem over the ring of integers of any number field has a negative answer. Our approach differs since we are obtaining our elliptic curves by specializing a nonisotrivial rank $1$ family of elliptic curves and we compute all the ranks involved."

We prove that, using $O(k \log(N/k))$ matrix-vector products and ${O}(N k^2 \log(N/k))$ additional runtime, the algorithm returns an HSS matrix $B$ with rank-$k$ blocks whose expected Frobenius norm error $\mathbb{E}[\|A - B\|_F^2]$ is at most $O(\log(N/k))$ times worse than the best possible approximation error by an HSS rank-$k$ matrix. In fact, the algorithm we analyze in a simple modification of an empirically effective method proposed by [Levitt & Martinsson, SISC 2024]. As a stepping stone towards our main result, we prove two results that are of independent interest: a similar guarantee for a variant of the algorithm which accesses $A$'s entries directly, and explicit error bounds for near-optimal subspace approximation using projection-cost-preserving sketches. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis constitutes the first polynomial-time quasi-optimality result for HSS matrix approximation, both in the explicit access model and the matrix-vector product query model."

We give a criterion for the existence and uniqueness of autonomous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on an open submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and the framework allows for a wider choice of Lyapunov functions. In the meantime, the invariance of open submanifolds, which is a biologically feasible result and has been implicitly incorporated into many biological and ecological models, facilitates the application of analytic tools typically suited to $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and indicates the persistence of predator and prey populations, thus providing a criterion for determining whether a population will become extinct. We apply the well-posedness criterion to our stochastic Rosenzweig-MacArthur model and show the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Furthermore, the asymptotic estimates of solutions are obtained, indicating the at most exponential growth of the population with internal stochasticity. Some numerical experiments are performed, which illustrate the discrepancy between the deterministic and stochastic models. Overall, this work demonstrates the broad applicability of our results to ecological models with constrained dynamics, offering a foundation for analyzing extinction, persistence, and well-posedness in systems where internal randomness dominates. This paper not only promotes the development of stochastic modeling and stochastic differential equations in theoretical ecology but also proposes a rigorous mathematical methodology for studying the predator-prey system with internal stochasticity."

The minimum total wight among all such colorings is defined to be the fractional balanced chromatic number, denoted by $χ-{fb}(G, σ)$. This value is clearly upper bounded by the fractional arboricity of $G$, denoted $a_f (G)$, where weights are assigned to sets inducing no cycle rather than sets inducing no negative cycle. In this work we present an example of a planar signed simple graph of fractional balanced chromatic number larger than 2, thus in particular refuting a conjecture of Bonamy, Kardos, Kelly, and Postle suggesting that the fractional arboricity of planar graphs is bounded above by 2. By iterating the construction, we show that the supremum of the fractional balanced chromatic number of planar signed simple graphs is at least as $83/41 = 2 + 1/41$. With similar operations, we built a sequence of planar graphs whose limit of fractional arboricity is $a_f (G) = 2 + 2/25$."

2505.16766,Dynamical Geometric Theory of Principal Bundle Constrained Systems: Strong Transversality Conditions and Variational Framework for Gauge Field Coupling,['math.GM'],['Dongzhe Zheng'],"This paper introduces a geometric mechanics framework for constrained systems on principal bundles through \emph{compatible pairs} $(\mathcal{D}, λ)$, addressing fundamental challenges in gauge-constrained physical systems. We characterize the strong transversality condition by pairing constraint distributions $\mathcal{D}$ with Lie algebra dual functions $λ: P \to \mathfrak{g}^*$ satisfying compatibility $\mathcal{D}_p = \{v : \langleλ(p), ω(v)\rangle = 0\}$ and differential consistency $dλ+ \mathrm{ad}^*_ωλ= 0$. This framework proves equivalent to $G$-equivariant Atiyah sequence splittings. We establish bidirectional construction enabling computation: forward (from $λ$ to compatible $\mathcal{D}$) and inverse (via variational minimization). Key mathematical contributions include existence theorems for bundles with $\mathrm{ad}^*_Ωλ= 0$ and uniqueness results for semi-simple groups with $\mathfrak{z}(\mathfrak{g}) = 0$, providing rigorous foundations for constraint classification. Our central physical insight emerges from variational principles, deriving dynamic connection equations $\partial_tω= d^ωη- ι_{X_H}Ω$ revealing constraint-curvature coupling: $P_{\text{constraint}} = \langleλ,Ω(\dot{q},δq)\rangle$. This explains non-trivial constraint-field interactions in magnetohydrodynamics and Yang-Mills systems absent in kinematic theories. We construct Spencer cohomology for compatible pairs, establishing deep connections between topological invariants and conservation laws. Systematic comparison demonstrates that strong transversality captures essential constraint-curvature physics invisible to standard approaches. Applications span fluid dynamics, gauge theories, and geometric control, providing new tools for complex physical systems with intrinsic gauge-constraint coupling."

Our method introduces a modified multinomial manifold endowed with a prescribed stationary vector, while also satisfying the detailed balance conditions, all within the framework of the Fisher metric. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with an existing quadratic programming method and demonstrate its effectiveness through a series of synthetic experiments, as well as in the construction of a reversible Markov chain from transition count data obtained via direct estimation from a stochastic differential equation."

Equivalence with variational solutions is established using a stability result for weak solutions. A key tool in our arguments is approximation of parabolic BV functions using time mollification and Sobolev approximations. We also prove a comparison principle and a local boundedness result for solutions. When the time derivative of the solution is in $L^2$ our definitions are equivalent with the definition based on the Anzellotti pairing."
2505.16729,"Equilibrium States, Zero Temperature Limits and Entropy Continuity for Almost-Additive Potentials",['math.DS'],['Jie Cao'],"This paper is devoted to study the equilibrium states for almost-additive potentials defined over topologically mixing countable Markov shifts (that is a non-compact space) without the big images and preimages (BIP) property. Let $\F$ be an almost-additive and summable potential with bounded variation potential. We prove that there exists an unique equilibrium state $μ_{t\F}$ for each $t>1$ and there exists an accumulation point $μ_{\infty}$ for the family $(μ_{t\F})_{t>1}$ as $t\to\infty$. We also obtain that the Gurevich pressure $P_{G}(t\F)$ is $C^1$ on $(1,\infty)$ and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy $h(μ_{t\F})$ is continuous at $(1,\infty)$. As two applications, we extend completely the results for the zero temperature limit [J. Stat. Phys. ,155 (2014),pp. 23-46] and entropy continuity at infinity [J. Stat.

2505.16721,Optimal control of mean-field limit of multiagent systems with and without common noise,['math.OC'],['Giuseppe La Scala'],"We consider a generic, suitable class of optimal control problems under a constraint given by a finite-dimensional SDE-ODE system, describing a system of two interacting species of particles: the herd, described by SDEs, and the herders, described by ODEs with the addition of a control function.
  In particular, we firstly show that for a low number of herders and for the limit of large number of herd individuals, the SDE-ODE system can be approximated by an infinite-dimensional system given by a McKean-Vlasov single SDE coupled with ODEs. Then, thanks to this we show the $Γ-$convergence of the optimal control problem for the finite-dimensional system to a certain optimal control problem for the mean-field system.
  Differently from Ascione-Castorina-Solombrino [9] (SIAM J. Math. Anal., Vol. 55, No. 6, pp. 6965-6990 (2023)), we do not consider an additive noise for the herd, but a more general class, given by idiosyncratic noises (due to a single herd individual) together with common noise (due to how the environment affects the whole herd), and they are independent one from another. As well as this, we consider a more general class of control functions in the ODEs for herders, where the control is applied not only on the herd dynamics, but also on the herd one."

This category naturally lies between the classical biset functors and the diagonal $p$-permutation functors, serving as a bridge between them. Every biset functor and every diagonal $p$-permutation functor restricts to a $p$-bifree biset functor.
  We classify the simple $p$-bifree biset functors over a field $K$ of characteristic zero, showing that they are parametrized by pairs $(G,V)$, where $G$ is a finite group and $V$ is a simple $K\mathrm{Out}(G)$-module. As key examples, we compute the composition factors of several representation-theoretic functors in the $p$-bifree setting, including the Burnside ring functor, the $p$-bifree Burnside functor, the Brauer character ring functor, and the ordinary character ring functor. We further investigate classical simple biset functors, $S_{C_p \times C_p, \mathbb{C}}$ and $S_{C_q \times C_q, \mathbb{C}}$ for a prime $q\neq p$."

2505.16706,The Graded Classification Conjecture holds for graphs with disjoint cycles,"['math.RA', 'math.DS', 'math.OA']",['Lia Vas'],"The Graded Classification Conjecture (GCC) states that the pointed $K_0^{\operatorname{gr}}$-group is a complete invariant of the Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs when these algebras are considered with their natural grading by $\mathbb Z.$ The conjecture has previously been shown to hold in some special cases. The main result of the paper shows that the GCC holds for a significantly more general class of graphs included in the class of graphs with disjoint cycles. In particular, our result holds for finite graphs with disjoint cycles. We show the main result also for graph $C^*$-algebras. As a consequence, the graded version of the Isomorphism Conjecture holds for the class of graphs we consider.
  Besides showing the conjecture for the class of graphs we consider, we realize the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-group isomorphism by a specific graded $*$-isomorphism. In particular, we introduce a series of graph operations which preserve the graded $*$-isomorphism class of their algebras. After performing these operations on a graph, we obtain well-behaved ``representative'' graphs, which we call canonical forms. We define an equivalence $\approx$ on graphs such that $E\approx F$ holds when there are isomorphic canonical forms of $E$ and $F$ and we show that the condition $E\approx F$ is equivalent to the existence of an isomorphism $f$ of the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-groups of the algebras of $E$ and $F$ in the appropriate category. As $E\approx F$ can be realized by a finite series of specific graph operations, any such isomorphism $f$ can be realized by an explicit graded $*$-algebra isomorphism. Thus, we describe the graded ($*$-)isomorphism classes of the algebras of graphs we consider. Besides the ties to symbolic dynamics and Williams' Problem, such a description is relevant for the active program of classification of graph $C^*$-algebras."

Then, an asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries that generalizes the lattice gas model of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn is introduced and invariance of the one-dimensional Ising measure is proved. The stationary current is computed in explicit form and is shown to exhibit current reversal at some density. Based on the extremal-current principle for one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with one conservation law, the phase diagram for boundary-induced phase transitions is conjectured for this case. There are two extremal-current phases, unlike in the open ASEP (one extremal-current phase) or in the conventional KLS model (one or three extremal-current phases)."

We prove the existence of a discrete spectrum for energy windows of the scale $h^{4/3}$ and give complete asymptotics in the semiclassical paramater $h$ for eigenvalues in such windows. Our strategy relies on the microlocalization of the corresponding eigenfunctions close to the zero locus $Γ$ and on the implementation of a Born-Oppenheimer strategy through the use of operator-valued pseudodifferential calculus and superadiatic projectors. This allows us to reduce our spectral analysis to that of effective semiclassical pseudodifferential operators in dimension 1 and apply the well-known semiclassical techniques à la Helffer-Sjöstrand.

2505.16542,Cancellation properties for exotic $4$-dimensional positive scalar curvature metrics,"['math.AT', 'math.DG']",['Johannes Ebert'],"Ruberman constructed families $\{g_n\vert n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{R}^+ (M)$ of metrics of positive scalar curvature on certain $4$-manifolds which are concordant but lie in different path components of $\mathcal{R}^+ (M)$. We prove a cancellation result along the following lines. For each closed manifold $N$, there is a map $ν_N: \mathcal{R}^+ (M) \to \mathcal{R}^+ (M \times N)$, well-defined up to homotopy, that takes the product with $N$. We prove that when $N$ has positive dimension $ν_N$ takes all metrics of Ruberman's family to the same path component. This is trivial when $N$ has a psc metric and follows from pseudoisotopy theory when $\dim (N) \geq 3$. Our proof is cobordism theoretic in nature and also applies to $\dim(N) =1,2$. The proof relies on rigidity properties for the action of the diffeomorphism group on $\mathcal{R}^+(L)$ for high-dimensional $N$ and a calculation of $π_1(\mathrm{MTSO(4)})$ that we also carry out.
  Recently, Auckly and Ruberman exhibited examples of elements in higher homotopy groups of $\mathcal{R}^+(M^4)$ for certain $M$. Using the same method, we also prove that these elements lie in the kernel of the induced map $(ν_N)_*$ on rational homotopy."

The model operator is given by $L_au(z)=\mathrm{div}(|y|^a\nabla u)(z)$, where $z=(x,y)\in\mathbb R^{d-n}\times\mathbb R^n$, $2\leq n\leq d$ are two integers and $a\in\mathbb R$. The weight term is degenerate/singular on the (possibly very) thin characteristic manifold $Σ_0=\{|y|=0\}$ of dimension $0\leq d-n\leq d-2$. Whenever $a+n>0$, we prove smoothness of the axially symmetric $L_a$-harmonic functions. In the mid-range $a+n\in(0,2)$, we deal with regularity estimates for solutions with inhomogeneous conormal boundary conditions prescribed at $Σ_0$, and we establish the connection with fractional Laplacians on very thin flat manifolds via Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps, as a higher codimensional analogue of the extension theory developed by Caffarelli and Silvestre.

  In this paper, we address the following problem: Given a weight 2 cuspidal Hecke eigenform $f$ without CM which is of CM type modulo $\ell$ by an imaginary quadratic field $K$, does there exist a congruence modulo $\ell$ between $f$ and a genuine CM modular form of weight 2? We conjecture that the answer is yes, and prove this conjecture in most cases.
  We study three situations: the case of modular forms attached to abelian surfaces with quaternionic multiplication, the case of $\mathbb{Q}$-curves completely defined over an imaginary quadratic field, and the case of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with modular-maximal cyclic group of order $16$ as $5$-torsion Galois module. In all these situations, at some specific primes $\ell$, it can be shown that the residual representation is monomial by a quadratic imaginary field $K$ (or even more than one), and we can conclude that in most of these cases there is a congruence with a CM modular form. Finally, we present some of the numerical evidence that initially led us to formulate the conjecture."

To ensure that the intermediary's financial equilibrium is preserved, we introduce a funding constraint in the model by enforcing in a time-consistent manner a sequential second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) of the portfolio return distribution over the liability distribution. We demonstrate that imposing the SSD constraint at the last-but-one stage is sufficient to enforce the SSD ordering at each stage. To deal with the computational burden of associated MSP, we develop a novel decomposition scheme integrating, for the first time in the literature, time-consistent dynamic risk measures and sequential stochastic dominance constraints.

The key ingredient is a local inf-sup condition, enabled by enriching the approximation space with appropriate $\boldsymbol{H}$(d) bubble functions (with d = curl or div). This enrichment allows for the construction of modified interpolation operators, which are crucial for establishing optimal a priori error estimates in the energy norm. Numerical examples are presented to verify both the theoretical results and the stabilization properties of the proposed method."

Let $h\geq 1$ be an integer and consider the Thue inequality $$|F(x,y)|\leq h.$$ Following the seminal work of Thue in 1909, several papers were written giving an upper bound for the number of solutions of the above inequality as $\ll c(r,s,h)$ where $c(r,s,h)$ is an explicit function of $r,s$ and $h.$ Invariably, the absolute constant involved in $\ll$ has been left undetermined. In this paper, following Bombieri, Schmidt and Mueller, we give three different upper bounds which are explicit in every aspect."

The schemes combine a generic projection method for spatial discretisation to a stochastic collocation scheme for the random variables. We study the problem in operator form, and derive estimates for the total error of the schemes, in terms of the spatial projector. We give conditions on the projected random data which guarantee analyticity of the semi-discrete solution as a Banach-valued function. We illustrate how to verify hypotheses starting from analytic random data and a choice of spatial projection.

2505.16428,Sharp Asymptotic Minimaxity for One-Group Priors in Sparse Normal Means Problem,['math.ST'],"['Sayantan Paul', 'Prasenjit Ghosh', 'Arijit Chakrabarti']","In this paper, we consider the asymptotic properties of the Bayesian multiple testing rules when the mean parameter of the sparse normal means problem is modeled by a broad class of global-local priors, expressed as a scale mixture of normals. We are interested in studying the least possible risk, i.e., the minimax risk for two frequentist losses, one being the usual misclassification (or Hamming) loss, and the other one, measured as the sum of FDR and FNR. Under the betamin separation condition, at first, assuming the level of sparsity to be known, we propose a condition on the global parameter of our chosen class of priors, such that the resultant decision rule attains the minimax risk for both of the losses mentioned above. When the level of sparsity is unknown, we either use an estimate of the global parameter obtained from the data, or propose an absolutely continuous prior on it. For both of the procedures, under some assumption on the unknown level of sparsity, we show that the decision rules also attain the minimax risk, again for both of the losses. Our results also provide a guideline regarding the selection of priors, in the sense that beyond a subclass(horseshoe type priors) of our chosen class of priors, the minimax risk is not achievable with respect to any one of the two loss functions considered in this article. However, the subclass, horseshoe-type priors, is such a large subclass that it contains Horseshoe, Strawderman Berger, standard double Pareto, inverse gamma priors, just to name a few. In this way, along with the most popular BH procedure and approach using spike and slab prior, a multiple testing rule based on one group priors also achieves the optimal boundary. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results in the literature of global local priors which ensure the optimal minimax risk can be achieved exactly."

2505.16417,On the Hausdorff spectra of free pro-$p$ groups and certain $p$-adic analytic groups,['math.GR'],"['Iker de las Heras', 'Benjamin Klopsch', 'Anitha Thillaisundaram']","We establish that finitely generated non-abelian direct products $G$ of free pro-$p$ groups have full Hausdorff spectrum with respect to the lower $p$-series $\mathcal{L}$. This complements similar results with respect to other standard filtration series and a recent theorem showing that the Hausdorff spectrum $\text{hspec}^\mathcal{L}(G)$ of a $p$-adic analytic pro-$p$ group $G$ is discrete and consists of at most $2^{\dim(G)}$ rational numbers.
  The latter also left some room for improvement regarding the upper bound. Indeed, for finitely generated nilpotent pro-$p$ groups $G$ we obtain the stronger assertion that the cardinality of the Hausdorff spectrum is at most the analytic dimension of $G$. Moreover, we produce a corresponding result when the $p$-adic analytic pro-$p$ group $G$ is just infinite, which holds not just for the lower $p$-series but for arbitrary filtration series.
  Finally, we show that, if $G$ is a countably based pro-$p$ group with an open subgroup mapping onto the free abelian pro-$p$ group $\mathbb{Z}_p \oplus \mathbb{Z}_p$, then for every prescribed finite set $\{0,1\} \subseteq X \subseteq [0,1]$ there is a filtration series $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\text{hspec}^\mathcal{S}(G) = X$; in particular, $|\text{hspec}^{\mathcal{S}}(G)|$ is unbounded, as $\mathcal{S}$ runs through all filtration series of $G$ with $|\text{hspec}^{\mathcal{S}}(G)| < \infty$."

By employing a refined Brezis-Merle type analysis, we establish sufficient conditions of Ding-Jost-Li-Wang type for the existence of solutions to this equation in critical cases, particularly when $h_1$ and $h_2$ may change signs.

We also show that a fusion system over a discrete $p$-toral group $S$ is saturated if its set of morphisms is closed under a certain topology and the finite subgroups of $S$ satisfy the saturation axioms, and prove a version of the Cartan-Eilenberg stable elements theorem for locally finite groups."

We extend an existing convergence bound to demonstrate that the approximation of small eigenvalues by harmonic Ritz values plays a key role in convergence behavior. Next, we analyze the impact of deflation using carefully selected vectors and combine this with a Complex Shifted Laplacian preconditioner. Finally, we apply these tools to two numerical examples near (quasi-)resonant frequencies, using them to explain how the convergence rate evolves."

We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem.

2505.16316,Differential Characters and $D$-Group Schemes,['math.AG'],"['Rajat Kumar Mishra', 'Arnab Saha']","Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero with a fixed derivation $\partial$ on it. In the case when $A$ is an abelian scheme, Buium considered the group scheme $K(A)$ which is the kernel of differential characters (also known as Manin characters) on the jet space of $A$. Then $K(A)$ naturally inherits a $D$-group scheme structure. Using the theory of universal vectorial extensions of $A$, he further showed that $K(A)$ is a finite dimensional vectorial extension of $A$.
  Let $G$ be a smooth connected commutative finite dimensional group scheme over $\mathrm{Spec}~ K$. In this paper, using the theory of differential characters, we show that the associated kernel group scheme $K(G)$ is a finite dimensional $D$-group scheme that is a vectorial extension of such a general $G$.
  Our proof relies entirely on understanding the structure of jet spaces. Our method also allows us togive a classification of the module of differential characters $\mathbf{X}_\infty(G)$ in terms of primitive characters as a $K\{\partial\}$-module."

The sample covariance matrix (SCM) being singular, regularization is mandatory in this case. For this purpose we consider minimizing Stein's loss function and we investigate a method based on augmenting the partial Cholesky decomposition of the SCM. We first derive the finite sample optimum estimator which minimizes the loss for each data realization, then the Oracle estimator which minimizes the risk, i.e., the average value of the loss. Finally a practical scheme is presented where the missing part of the Cholesky decomposition is filled. We conduct a numerical performance study of the proposed method and compare it with available related methods. In particular we investigate the influence of the condition number of the covariance matrix as well as of the shape of its spectrum."

We prove the following:
  (i) If every finite-index subgroup of $π_1(M_2)$ has trivial center, then any non-zero degree map from $E_1$ to $E_2$ is homotopic to a fiber-preserving map.
  (ii) The mapping degree set of fiber-preserving maps from $E_1$ to $E_2$ is given by $$\{0\} \cup\{k\cdot \mathrm{deg}(f) \ | \, k\ne 0, \ f\colon M_1\to M_2 \, \text{with} \, \mathrm{deg}(f)\ne 0 \ \text{such that}\, f^\#(e_2)=ke_1\},$$ where $f^\# \colon H^2(M_2;\mathbb{Z})\to H^2(M_1;\mathbb{Z})$ is the induced homomorphism.
  As applications of (i) and (ii), we obtain the following results with respect to the finiteness and the realization problems for mapping degree sets:
  ($\mathcal F$) The mapping degree set $D(E_1, E_2)$ is finite if $M_2$ is hyperbolic and $e_2$ is not torsion.
  ($\mathcal R$) For any finite set $A$ of integers containing $0$ and each $n>2$, $A$ is the mapping degree set $D(M,N)$ for some closed oriented $n$-manifolds $M$ and $N$.
  Items (i) and ($\mathcal F$) extend in all dimensions $\geq 3$ the previously known $3$-dimensional case (i.e., for maps between circle bundles over hyperbolic surfaces).

Rossmanith', 'Christine Vaughan']","Vlasov equations model the dynamics of plasma in the collisionless regime. A standard approach for numerically solving the Vlasov equation is to operator split the spatial and velocity derivative terms, allowing simpler time-stepping schemes to be applied to each piece separately (known as the Cheng-Knorr method). One disadvantage of such an operator split method is that the order of accuracy of fluid moments (e.g., mass, momentum, and energy) is restricted by the order of the operator splitting (second-order accuracy in the Cheng-Knorr case). In this work, we develop a novel approach that first represents the particle density function on a velocity mesh with a local fluid approximation in each discrete velocity band and then introduces an operator splitting that splits the inter-velocity band coupling terms from the dynamics within the discrete velocity band. The advantage is that the inter-velocity band coupling terms are only needed to achieve consistency of the full distribution functions, but the local fluid models within each band are sufficient to achieve high-order accuracy on global moments such as mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting scheme is verified on several standard Vlasov-Poisson test cases."

The natural frequencies are assumed to be independent and identically distributed on a bounded interval. In the previous work, the corresponding continuum limit (CL) was proven to approximate stable motions in the KM well when the natural frequencies are deterministic, even if the graph is not uniform, although it may not do so for unstable motions and bifurcations. We show that the method of CLs is still valid even when the natural frequencies are random, especially uniformly distributed. In particular, an asymptotically stable family of solutions to the CL is proven to behave in the $L^2$ sense as if it is an asymptotically stable one in the KM, under an appropriate uniform random permutation. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with uniformly distributed random natural frequencies."

We further highlight some novelties such as the relationship with the spectrum of the spinor Dirac operator and the Hodge de Rham operator when a parallel spinor field exists and a brief discussion of spinors along a hypersurface in $\bR^4$. Lastly, we extend our construction to arbitrary signature quadratic forms thus providing a complete and explicit family of spinor representations for all mixed signature Clifford algberas. We show that in all cases the spinor representations can be expressed as tensor products of multi-vectors over the fields $\bR$, $\bC$, and $\bH$."

In this article, under some mild extra assumptions about $X$, the authors prove that, for both parameters $q$ and $γ$ in \emph{sharp} ranges which are related to $X$ and for any locally integrable function $f$ on ${\mathbb{R}^n}$ satisfying $|\nabla^k f|\in X$, $$ \sup_{λ\in(0,\infty)}λ\left\|\left[\int_{\{h\in\mathbb{R}^n:\ |Δ_h^k f(\cdot)|>λ|h|^{k+\fracγ{q}}\}} \left|h\right|^{γ-n}\,dh\right]^\frac{1}{q}\right\|_X \sim \left\|\,\left|\nabla^k f\right|\,\right\|_{X} $$ with the positive equivalence constants independent of $f$. As applications, the authors establish the Brezis--Seeger--Van Schaftingen--Yung (for short, BSVY) characterization of higher-order homogeneous ball Banach Sobolev spaces and higher-order fractional Gagliardo--Nirenberg and Sobolev type inequalities in critical cases. All these results are of quite wide generality and can be applied to various specific function spaces; moreover, even when $X:= L^{q}$, these results when $k=1$ coincide with the best known results and when $k\ge 2$ are completely new. The first novelty is
  to establish a sparse characterization of dyadic cubes in level sets related to the higher-order local approximation, which, together with the well-known Whitney inequality in approximation theory, further induces a higher-order weighted variant of the remarkable inequality obtained by A. Cohen, W. Dahmen, I. Daubechies, and R. DeVore; the second novelty is to combine this weighted inequality neatly with a variant higher-order Poincaré inequality to establish the desired upper estimate of BSVY formulae in weighted Lebesgue spaces."

By using duality arguments, translating techniques and block diagonal operator skills, we completely characterize the $r$-summability of the natural embeddings $I_d:F^p_{α,w}\to L^p_α(μ)$ for any $r\geq1$ and $p>1$, where $w$ is a weight on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ that satisfies an $A_p$-type condition. As applications, we establish some results on the $r$-summability of differentiation and integration operators, Volterra-type operators and composition operators. Especially, we completely characterize the boundedness of Volterra-type operators and composition operators on vector-valued Fock spaces for all $1<p<\infty$, which were left open before for the case $1<p<2$."

  As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that the presence of the marked boundary point $q$ gives rise to a natural equivalence relation on partition functions. While these functions are not necessarily conformally covariant, each equivalence class contains a conformally covariant representative.
  Building on the framework introduced in \cite{Dub07}, we demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{H}$-uniformization with $q = \infty$, the partition functions satisfy both the null vector equations and a dilatation equation with scaling exponent $d$.
  Using techniques from the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct two distinct families of solutions, each indexed by a topological link pattern of type $(n, m)$ with $2m \leq n$.
  In the special case $Ω= \mathbb{H}$ and $q = \infty$, we further show that these partition functions correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Moser system, thereby extending the known correspondence beyond the standard $(2n, n)$ setting."

Construct a mathematical model that describes how an image gets blurred. Convert a calculus problem into a linear algebra problem by discretization. Inverting the blurring process should sharpen up an image; this requires the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations. Solving this linear system of equations turns out to be delicate, as deblurring is an example of an ill-posed inverse problem. To address this challenge, recast the system as a regularized least squares problem (also known as ridge regression)."

In earlier joint works with Jeffrey D. Adler, Jessica Fintzen, and Manish Mishra, we proved that the Hecke algebras attached to types constructed by Kim and Yu are isomorphic to the Hecke algebras attached to depth-zero types. Note that if $G$ splits over a tamely ramified extension of $F$ and $p$ does not divide the order of the absolute Weyl group of $G$, such Hecke algebras cover the Hecke algebras attached to arbitrary Bernstein blocks. We also proved that for a depth-zero type $(K, ρ)$, the corresponding Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G(F), (K, ρ))$ has an explicit description as a semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W(ρ_M)_{\mathrm{aff}}, q)$ with a twisted group algebra $\mathbb{C}[Ω(ρ_{M}), μ]$, generalizing prior work of Morris.
  In this paper, we show that the affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(W(ρ_M)_{\mathrm{aff}}, q)$ appearing in the description of the Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}(G(F), (K, ρ))$ attached to a depth-zero type $(K, ρ)$ is isomorphic to the one attached to a unipotent type for a connected reductive group splitting over an unramified extension of $F$. This makes it possible to calculate the parameters of the affine Hecke algebras for depth-zero types and types constructed by Kim and Yu explicitly. In particular, we prove a version of Lusztig's conjecture that the parameters of the Hecke algebra attached to an arbitrary Bernstein block agree with those of a unipotent Bernstein block under the assumption that $G$ splits over a tamely ramified extension of $F$ and $p$ does not divide the order of the absolute Weyl group of $G$."
2505.16032,CUR Matrix Approximation through Convex Optimization for Feature Selection,['math.NA'],"['Kathryn Linehan', 'Radu Balan']","The singular value decomposition (SVD) is commonly used in applications requiring a low rank matrix approximation. However, the singular vectors cannot be interpreted in terms of the original data. For applications requiring this type of interpretation, e.g., selection of important data matrix columns or rows, the approximate CUR matrix factorization can be used. Work on the CUR matrix approximation has generally focused on algorithm development, theoretical guarantees, and applications. In this work, we present a novel deterministic CUR formulation and algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees. The algorithm utilizes convex optimization, finds important columns and rows separately, and allows the user to control the number of important columns and rows selected from the original data matrix. We present numerical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our CUR algorithm as a feature selection method on gene expression data. These results are compared to those using the SVD and other CUR algorithms as the feature selection method. Lastly, we present a novel application of CUR as a feature selection method to determine discriminant proteins when clustering protein expression data in a self-organizing map (SOM), and compare the performance of multiple CUR algorithms in this application."

To address this, we use the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) that constructs localized spectral basis functions on coarse grids. This approach efficiently captures dominant multiscale features while solving heterogeneous PDEs accurately at reduced computational cost. However, computing these basis functions is computationally expensive. This gap motivates our core idea: to use a NO to learn the subspace itself - rather than individual basis functions - by employing a subspace-informed loss. On standard multiscale benchmarks - namely a linear elliptic diffusion problem and the nonlinear, steady-state Richards equation - our hybrid method cuts solution error by approximately $60\%$ compared with standalone NOs and reduces basis-construction time by about $60$ times relative to classical GMsFEM, while remaining independent of forcing terms and boundary conditions. The result fuses multiscale finite-element robustness with NO speed, yielding a practical solver for heterogeneous PDEs."

This new perspective to studying energy cascades, distinct from traditional analyses based on kinetic equations and their cascade spectra, focuses on the underlying statistical steady state that is expected to hold when the cascade spectra of wave turbulence manifest.
  In the full generality of the (infinite dimensional) nonlinear Schrödinger equation, constructing such invariant measures is more involved than the rigorous justification of the Kolmogorov-Zakharov (KZ) spectra, which itself remains an outstanding open question despite the recent progress on mathematical wave turbulence. Since such complexity remains far beyond the current knowledge (even for much simpler chain models), we confine our analysis to a three-mode reduced system that captures the resonant dynamics of the NLS equation, offering a tractable framework for constructing the NESS. For this, we introduce a novel approach based on solving an elliptic Feynman-Kac equation to construct the needed Lyapunov function."

Ignacio Alvarez-Hamelin']","Graph rigidity, the study of vertex realizations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and the motions that preserve the induced edge lengths, has been the focus of extensive research for decades. Its equivalency to graph connectivity for $d=1$ is well known; thus it can be viewed as a generalization that incorporates geometric constraints. Graph connectivity is commonly quantified by the algebraic connectivity, the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. Recently, a graph invariant for quantifying graph rigidity in $\mathbb{R}^d$, termed the generalized algebraic connectivity, was introduced. Recognizing the intrinsic relationship between rigidity and connectivity, this article presents new contributions. In particular, we introduce the d-rigidity ratio as a metric for expressing the level of rigidity of a graph in $\mathbb{R}^d$ relative to its connectivity. We show that this ratio is bounded and provide extremal examples. Additionally, we offer a new upper bound for the generalized algebraic connectivity that depends inversely on the diameter and on the vertex connectivity, thereby improving previous bounds. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between graph rigidity and the diameter, a measure of the graph's overall extent. We provide the maximal diameter achievable by rigid graphs and show that generalized path graphs serve as extremal examples. Finally, we derive an upper bound for the generalized algebraic connectivity of generalized path graphs that (asymptotically) improves upon existing ones by a factor of four."

This approach follows the main lines of broken-FEEC schemes which define stable and structure-preserving operators in non-conforming discretizations of the de Rham sequence. Here, we devise a polar broken-FEEC framework that enables the use of standard tensor-product spline spaces while ensuring stability and smoothness for the solutions, as well as the preservation of the de Rham structure: A benefit of this approach is the ability to reuse codes that implement standard splines on smooth parametric domains, and efficient solvers such as Kronecker-product spline interpolation. Our construction is based on two pillars: the first one is an explicit characterization of smooth polar spline spaces within the tensor-product splines ones, which are either discontinuous or non square-integrable as a result of the singular polar pushforward operators. The second pillar consists of local, explicit and matrix-free conforming projection operators that map general tensor-product splines onto smooth polar splines, and that commute with the differential operators of the de Rham sequence."

The model uses a compatible finite element spatial discretisation, achieving good linear wave dispersion properties without spurious computational modes. A convergence test confirms the model's high temporal accuracy. Arbitrarily high spatial-temporal convergence is demonstrated using a gravity wave test case. The model is further extended to include the parametrisation of a simple physics process by adding two phases of moisture and its validity is demonstrated for a rising thermal problem.

To address PDEs in the feedback loop, a boundary control law and a re-design of the additive probing signal are mandatory. The latter, commonly called ""trajectory generation"" or ""motion planning,"" involves designing perturbation signals that anticipate their propagation through PDEs. Specifically, this requires solving motion planning problems for systems governed by parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) is a powerful tool for solving PDEs by embedding physical laws as constraints in the neural network's loss function, enabling efficient solutions for high-dimensional, nonlinear, and complex problems. This paper proposes a novel construction integrating PINN and ES, automating the motion planning process for specific PDE systems and eliminating the need for case-by-case analytical derivations. The proposed strategy efficiently extracts perturbation signals, optimizing the PDE system."

Each equation of such system involves the sum of the two negative Laplace operators raised to two distinct fractional powers in the space of three dimensions. The proof of the existence of solutions is based on a fixed point technique. We use the solvability conditions for the non-Fredholm elliptic operators in unbounded domains.

It is known that, in the cases $m=1$, bad approximability of $\pmbξ$ is equivalent to the boundedness of ratios $\frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}$, while for $n=1$ bad approximability of $\pmbξ$ is equivalent to the boundedness of ratios $ \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}}$. Moreover, carefully constructed example show that in the cases $m=1$ and $n=1$ boundedness of ratios $ \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}}$ and $\frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}$ respectively (the order of ratios changed), does not imply bad approximability of $\pmbξ$. In the present paper, we study the impact of the boundedness of ratios on Diophantine properties of $\pmbξ$, in particular, what restrictions it gives for Diophantine exponents $ω(\pmbξ)$ and $\hatω(\pmbξ)$. One of our particular results deals with the case $m=n=2$. We prove that for $2\times 2 $ matrices $\pmbξ$ boundedness of both ratios $ \frac{X_{i+1}}{X_i}, \frac{L_i}{L_{i+1}} $ implies inequality $\hatω(\pmbξ)\le \frac{4}{3}$ and that this result is optimal.

This model is thought to undergo a phase transition as the clause density changes, and it is believed that the random $k$-SAT problem is primarily difficult to solve near this critical phase. In this paper, we introduce a weak formulation of degrees of freedom for random $k$-SAT problems and demonstrate that the critical random $2$-SAT problem has $\sqrt[3]{n}$ degrees of freedom. This quantity represents the maximum number of variables that can be assigned truth values without affecting the formula's satisfiability. Notably, the value of $\sqrt[3]{n}$ differs significantly from the degrees of freedom in random $2$-SAT problems sampled below the satisfiability threshold, where the corresponding value equals $\sqrt{n}$. Thus, our result underscores the significant shift in structural properties and variable dependency as satisfiability problems approach criticality."

We explain how the resulting noncommutative effective gauge field theories produce classes in a compactification of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, when we pass to the large length scale limit. Within this setting, the large $N$ correspondence of 't Hooft -- describing a connection between open string theories and gauge theories -- appears as a relation between the noncommutative and commutative geometries.

We show that any such solution that decays at least like $\langle x\rangle^{-1-ε}$ for some $ε> 0$ in a comoving coordinate frame must in fact decay like $\langle x\rangle^{-2}$. In view of the explicit soliton solutions, this decay rate is sharp. Our proof has two main ingredients. The first is microlocal dispersive estimates for the Benjamin-Ono equation in a moving frame, which allow us to prove spatial decay of the solution provided the nonlinearity has sufficient decay. The second is a careful normal form analysis, which allows us to obtain rapid decay of the nonlinearity for a transformed equation assuming only modest decay of the solution. Our arguments are entirely time dependent, and do not require the solution to be an exact traveling wave."

This conjecture has been proved for symmetric groups, hyperoctahedral groups, all right-angled Coxeter groups, and computationally verified for finite Coxeter groups of types $D_4$, $F_4$, $G_2$, and $H_3$. This paper investigates all affine irreducible Coxeter groups of rank 3, specifically those of affine types $\widetilde{A}_2$, $\widetilde{C}_2$, and $\widetilde{G}_2$. By employing key concepts from building theory, we develop novel techniques: first reducing and classifying the convex hull in their Cayley graphs into finitely many cases, then proving the strong hull conjecture for these cases through combinatorial computations. Notably, for the case of affine type $\widetilde{G}_2$, we streamline the proof strategy by reducing it to a corollary of results established for affine type $\widetilde{A}_2$. The reduction techniques developed in this study demonstrate potential for generalization. Their possible algebraic reformulation may not only provide new perspectives for further investigation of this conjecture but also offer methodological insights for algebraic combinatorics and geometric group theory."

2505.15783,Rapid phase ordering for Ising and Potts dynamics on random regular graphs,"['math.PR', 'math-ph']","['Reza Gheissari', 'Allan Sly', 'Youngtak Sohn']","We consider the Ising, and more generally, $q$-state Potts Glauber dynamics on random $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices at low temperatures $β\gtrsim \frac{\log d}{d}$. The mixing time is exponential in $n$ due to a bottleneck between $q$ dominant phases consisting of configurations in which the majority of vertices are in the same state. We prove that for any $d\ge 7$, from biased initializations with $ε_d n$ more vertices in state-$1$ than in other states, the Glauber dynamics quasi-equilibrates to the stationary distribution conditioned on having plurality in state-$1$ in optimal $O(\log n)$ time. Moreover, the requisite initial bias $ε_d$ can be taken to zero as $d \to \infty$. Even for the $q=2$ Ising case, where the states are naturally identified with $\pm 1$, proving such a result requires a new approach in order to control negative information spread in spacetime despite the model being in low temperature and exhibiting strong local correlations. For this purpose, we introduce a coupled non-Markovian rigid dynamics for which a delicate temporal recursion on probability mass functions of minus spacetime cluster sizes establishes their subcriticality."

2505.15775,New Understandings and Computation on Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Low-Rank Semidefinite Programming,['math.OC'],"['Lijun Ding', 'Haihao Lu', 'Jinwen Yang']","Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) combined with Burer-Monteiro (BM) factorization, dubbed ALM-BM, offers a powerful approach for solving large-scale low-rank semidefinite programs (SDPs). Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understandings of the resulting non-convex ALM-BM subproblems, particularly concerning their structural properties and efficient subproblem solvability by first-order methods, still remain limited. This work addresses these notable gaps by providing a rigorous theoretical analysis. We demonstrate that, under appropriate regularity of the original SDP, termed as primal simplicity, ALM subproblems inherit crucial properties such as low-rankness and strict complementarity when the dual variable is localized. Furthermore, ALM subproblems are shown to enjoy a quadratic growth condition, building on which we prove that the non-convex ALM-BM subproblems can be solved to global optimality by gradient descent, achieving linear convergence under conditions of local initialization and dual variable proximity. Through illustrative examples, we further establish the necessity of these local assumptions, revealing them as inherent characteristics of the problem structure. Motivated by these theoretical insights, we propose ALORA, a rank-adaptive augmented Lagrangian method that builds upon the ALM-BM framework, which dynamically adjusts the rank using spectral information and explores negative curvature directions to navigate the nonconvex landscape. Exploiting modern GPU computing architectures, ALORA exhibits strong numerical performance, solving SDPs with tens of millions of dimensions in hundreds of seconds."
2505.15771,Elasto-acoustic wave propagation in geophysical media using hybrid high-order methods on general meshes,"['math.NA', 'cs.CE']","['Romain Mottier', 'Alexandre Ern', 'Laurent Guillot']","Hybrid high-order (HHO) methods are numerical methods characterized by several interesting properties such as local conservativity, geometric flexibility and high-order accuracy. Here, HHO schemes are studied for the space semi-discretization of coupled elasto-acoustic waves in the time domain using a first-order formulation. Explicit and singly diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta (ERK & SDIRK) schemes are used for the time discretization. We show that an efficient implementation of explicit (resp. implicit) time schemes calls for a static condensation of the face (resp. cell) unknowns. Crucially, both static condensation procedures only involve block-diagonal matrices. Then, we provide numerical estimates for the CFL stability limit of ERK schemes and present a comparative study on the efficiency of explicit versus implicit schemes. Our findings indicate that implicit time schemes remain competitive in many situations. Finally, simulations in a 2D realistic geophysical configuration are performed, illustrating the geometrical flexibility of the HHO method: both hybrid (triangular and quadrilateral) and nonconforming (with hanging nodes) meshes are easily handled, delivering results of comparable accuracy to a reference spectral element software based on tensorized elements."

Leveraging this semigroup, we derive an explicit representation for the inverse of the Dunkl-Riesz potential and characterize the image of the function space $L_k^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $1 \leq p < \frac{n + 2γ}α$. We further define the bi-parametric potential of order $α$ by $$\mathfrak{S}_k^{(α,β)} = \left(I + (-Δ_k)^{β/2}\right)^{-α/β}$$ and establish its inverse along with a detailed description of the associated range space. Our approach employs a wavelet-based method that represents the inverse as the limit of truncated hypersingular integrals parameterized by $ε> 0$. To analyze the convergence of these approximations, we introduce the concept of $η$-smoothness at a point $x_0$ in the Dunkl setting. We show that if a function $f \in L_k^p(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap L_k^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, possesses $η$-smoothness at $x_0$, then the truncated hypersingular approximations converge to $f(x_0)$ as $ε\to 0^+$."

This planning problem is complicated due to heterogeneous off-shore wind-driven uncertainties (i.e., renewable power, transport availability, demand fluctuations, and grid faulting), a subset of which exhibit endogenous uncertainty, as they can be affected by proactive measures (e.g., grid hardening) or infrastructure investment. To capture these features, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed considering decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), which encompasses variation of the underlying distributional ambiguity due to the change of the first stage decisions. Notably, the complete recourse property is missing, which is often neglected in existing DRO studies. Nevertheless, different from the case for land-based microgrids, this issue is critical and fundamental for sea island systems due to their particular physical and logistical requirements. To address these issues, we develop a C&CG algorithm that is customized with strong cutting planes to handle DRO with a varying DDU ambiguity set and feasibility requirements. Numerical results demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and resilience of the proposed planning framework, along with the nontrivial improvements of the algorithm in both solution accuracy and computational efficiency."

Bernoulli random numbers with $p=1/2$. Dual RSK algorithm gives a bijection of this matrix to a pair of Young tableaux of conjugate shape, which is manifestation of skew Howe $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-duality. Thus the probability measure on zero-ones matrix leads to the probability measure on Young diagrams proportional to the ratio of the dimension of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-representation and the dimension of the exterior algebra $\bigwedge\left(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{k}\right)$.
  Similarly, by applying Proctor's algorithm based on Berele's modification of the Schensted insertion, we get skew Howe duality for the pairs of groups $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$. In the limit when $n,k\to\infty$ $GL$-case is relatively easily studied by use of free-fermionic representation for the correlation kernel. But for the symplectic groups there is no convenient free-fermionic representation. We use Christoffel transformation to obtain the semiclassical orthogonal polynomials for $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$ from Krawtchouk polynomials that describe $GL_{2n}\times GL_{2k}$ case. We derive an integral representation for semiclassical polynomials. The study of the asymptotic of this integral representation gives us the description of the limit shapes and fluctuations of the random Young diagrams for symplectic groups."

Motivated by this, in this article, we study the question of self-duality of syzygies of the residue field of a local ring when they are known to be reflexive.

But due to the special structure of PE system and its domain, some new challenging difficulties arise: the lack of information about the vertical velocity, and existing corner points in the domain. We introduce some new ideas to overcome the above obstacles. As a byproduct, we give a sufficient condition for absence of anomalous energy dissipation in the vanishing viscosity limit."

The total average energy over all possible initial data and the total average displacement over all possible initial data. Our first result shows that both criteria are equivalent to the trace minimization of the solution of the Lyapunov equation with different right-hand sides. As the second result, we prove that in the case of damping with one damper, for the discrete system, the minimal trace for each criterion can be expressed as a linear or cubic function of the dimension $n$. Consequently, the optimal damping position is determined solely by the number of dominant eigenfrequencies and the optimal viscosity, independent of the dimension $n$, offering efficient damping optimization in discrete systems. The paper concludes with numerical examples illustrating the presented theoretical framework and results."

Moreover, we further study the time-reversed process between two consecutive resetting points and show that, within this time window, it behaves as the same reflecting Brownian motion with a negative drift, where both the jump sizes and the time spent at zero coincide with those of the process obtained under the stationary measure. We characterize the dynamics of both processes, their local times, and finally investigate elliptic problems on positive half-spaces, showing that the two processes leave the same traces at the boundary."

First, we consider Demazure products associated to random pipe dreams, generalizing the Grothendieck permutons introduced by Morales, Panova, Petrov, and Yeliussizov by replacing staircase shapes with arbitrary order-convex shapes. Using the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with geometric jumps, we prove precise scaling limit and fluctuation results for the associated height functions, showing that these models belong to the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We then consider permutons obtained by applying deterministic sequences of bubble-sort operators to random initial permutations. We again provide precise descriptions of the limiting permutons. In a special case, we deduce the exact forms of the standard bubble-sort permutons, the supports of which were computed by DiFranco.
  A crucial tool in our analysis is a formulation, due to Chan and Pflueger, of the Demazure product as matrix multiplication in the min-plus tropical semiring. This allows us to define a Demazure product on the set of permutons. We discuss further applications of this product. For instance, we show that the number of inversions of the Demazure product of two independent uniformly random permutations of size $n$ is $\binom{n}{2}(1-o(1))$."

The limit of the FCLT is given by a nonlinear stochastic integral equation which is solved by a random signed-measure. We further derive the weak solution in the form of a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) and propose an alternative representation of the FCLT, as fluctuations in the average total force of infection and average susceptibility."

For instance, $(\infty, 1)$-categories with limits, Cartesian fibrations between $(\infty, 1)$-categories, and adjunctions between $(\infty, 1)$-categories. In addition, we show that these $(\infty, 1)$-categories with structure in fact possess an important class of limits of lax morphisms, including $\infty$-categorical versions of inserters and equifiers, when only one morphism in the diagram is required to be structure-preserving. Our approach provides a minimal requirement and a transparent explanation for several kinds of limits of $(\infty, 1)$-categories and their lax morphisms to exist."

Recently, power method was proposed by Cui and Qi in Journal of Scientific Computing, 100 (2024) to solve such problem. Recognizing that the convergence rate of power method is slow due to its dependence on the eigenvalue distribution, we propose two improved versions of power method based on dual complex adjoint matrices and Aitken extrapolation, named DCAM-PM and ADCAM-PM. They achieve notable efficiency improvements and demonstrate significantly faster convergence. However, power method may be invalid for dual quaternion Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues having identical standard parts but distinct dual parts. To overcome this disadvantage, utilizing the eigen-decomposition properties of dual complex adjoint matrix, we propose a novel algorithm EDDCAM-EA which surpasses the power method in both accuracy and speed. Application to eigenvalue computations of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices in multi-agent formation control and numerical experiments highlight the remarkable accuracy and speed of our proposed algorithms."

The economic interpretation of this result is that, if the bubble asset can produce more stable returns than fiat money, agents protect themselves from hazardous situations through the bubble asset, thus forming a bubble's consensus value. Our mathematical analysis uses different ideas coming from the study of semi-linear elliptic equations."

Motivated by established regularities in free probability, this paper investigates analogous regularities for finite free convolutions. Key findings include triangle inequalities for these convolutions and necessary and sufficient conditions regarding atoms of probability measures. Applications of these results include proving the weak convergence of $\boxplus_d$ and $\boxtimes_d$ to their infinite counterparts $\boxplus$ and $\boxtimes$ as $d \to \infty$, without compactness assumptions. Furthermore, this weak convergence is strengthened to convergence in Kolmogorov distance."

We show that $Π_n$-strong cardinals, and, as a corollary, ``Ord is Woodin"" and weak Vopěnka's Principle, are characterized by compactness properties involving Henkin models for sort logic. This provides a model-theoretic analogy between Vopěnka's Principle and weak Vopěnka's Principle. We also characterize huge cardinals by compactness for type omission properties of the well-foundedness logic $\mathbb L(Q^{\text{WF}})$, and show that the compactness number of the Härtig quantifier logic $\mathbb L(I)$ can consistently be larger than the first supercompact cardinal. Finally, we show that the upward Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski number of second-order logic $\mathbb L^2$ and the sort logic $\mathbb L^{s,n}$ are given by the first extendible and $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinal, respectively."

We apply the notion of Kim-stabilizer and the stabilizer from Hrushovsky to the context of a group G definable in an NSOP1 field F satisfying some assumptions to show that there is a finite to one embedding of a type definable subgroup of G of bounded index into an algebraic group over F. We then show that definable groups in omega-free PAC fields satisfy these conditions."

  A one-parameter family of diagonal automorphisms exists, which we use to construct solutions to the (constant) Yang--Baxter equation. These solutions are conjectured to give rise to the two-variable Links--Gould polynomial invariants associated with the super-quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(N|1))$, where $N = \dim(V)$.

Finally, we introduce a refined algorithm for identifying candidates for x-flat outputs. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of our results. In particular, we show that the refined algorithm exceeds the capabilities of existing methods for computing flat outputs based on triangular forms."

This pointwise almost everywhere convergence result can be seen as a refinement of the norm convergence result obtained in Wooley--Ziegler (Amer. J.

2505.15543,Heavy-tailed and Horseshoe priors for regression and sparse Besov rates,['math.ST'],"['Sergios Agapiou', 'Ismaël Castillo', 'Paul Egels']","The large variety of functions encountered in nonparametric statistics, calls for methods that are flexible enough to achieve optimal or near-optimal performance over a wide variety of functional classes, such as Besov balls, as well as over a large array of loss functions. In this work, we show that a class of heavy-tailed prior distributions on basis function coefficients introduced in \cite{AC} and called Oversmoothed heavy-Tailed (OT) priors, leads to Bayesian posterior distributions that satisfy these requirements; the case of horseshoe distributions is also investigated, for the first time in the context of nonparametrics, and we show that they fit into this framework. Posterior contraction rates are derived in two settings. The case of Sobolev--smooth signals and $L_2$--risk is considered first, along with a lower bound result showing that the imposed form of the scalings on prior coefficients by the OT prior is necessary to get full adaptation to smoothness. Second, the broader case of Besov-smooth signals with $L_{p'}$--risks, $p' \geq 1$, is considered, and minimax posterior contraction rates, adaptive to the underlying smoothness, and including rates in the so-called {\em sparse} zone, are derived. We provide an implementation of the proposed method and illustrate our results through a simulation study."
2505.15538,Machine learning-based parameter optimization for Müntz spectral methods,['math.NA'],"['Wei Zeng', 'Chuanju Xu', 'Yiming Lu', 'Qian Wang']","Spectral methods employing non-standard polynomial bases, such as Müntz polynomials, have proven effective for accurately solving problems with solutions exhibiting low regularity, notably including sub-diffusion equations. However, due to the absence of theoretical guidance, the key parameters controlling the exponents of Müntz polynomials are usually determined empirically through extensive numerical experiments, leading to a time-consuming tuning process. To address this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based optimization framework for the Müntz spectral method. As an illustrative example, we optimize the parameter selection for solving time-fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to predict optimal parameter values based solely on the time-fractional order as input. The ANN is trained by minimizing solution errors on a one-dimensional time-fractional convection-diffusion equation featuring manufactured exact solutions that manifest singularities of varying intensity, covering a comprehensive range of sampled fractional orders. Numerical results for time-fractional PDEs in both one and two dimensions demonstrate that the ANN-based parameter prediction significantly improves the accuracy of the Müntz spectral method. Moreover, the trained ANN generalizes effectively from one-dimensional to two-dimensional cases, highlighting its robustness across spatial dimensions. Additionally, we verify that the ANN substantially outperforms traditional function approximators, such as spline interpolation, in both prediction accuracy and training efficiency. The proposed optimization framework can be extended beyond fractional PDEs, offering a versatile and powerful approach for spectral methods applied to various low-regularity problems."

The goal is to collaboratively minimize the sum of these local objective functions. In the presence of data heterogeneity across nodes, existing algorithms typically require communicating both local gradients and iterates to ensure exact convergence with constant step sizes. In this work, we propose REXTRA, a Riemannian extension of the EXTRA algorithm [Shi et al., SIOPT, 2015], to address this limitation. On the theoretical side, we leverage proximal smoothness to overcome the challenges of manifold nonconvexity and establish a global sublinear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$, matching the best-known results. To our knowledge, REXTRA is the first algorithm to achieve a global sublinear convergence rate under a constant step size while requiring only a single round of local iterate communication per iteration. Numerical experiments show that REXTRA achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while supporting larger step sizes and reducing total communication by over 50\%."

The code generation is done via automatic differentiation (AD) with AceGen. We compare hand-written and AD-generated codes under two computing strategies: on-the-fly evaluation and caching intermediate results. The comparison reveals that the AD-generated code achieves superior performance in matrix-free computations.
2505.15534,An enhanced extriangulated subquotient,"['math.CT', 'math.RT']","['Nao Mochizuki', 'Yasuaki Ogawa']","Bondal-Kapranov's enhanced triangulated categories perform nicely in the context of the localization theory, that is, the Verdier quotient is lifted to the Drinfeld dg quotient of pretriangulated dg categories. In this article, we provide a development of such an enhancement for Nakaoka-Palu's notion of extriangulated categories which contains exact and triangulated categories. The enhancement of them was recently initiated by Xiaofa Chen under the name of exact dg categories. In addition, it is known that a certain ideal quotient of an extriangulated category is still extriangulated, and such an extriangulated ideal quotient was enhanced by the dg quotient of the associated connective exact dg category there. Motivated by Chen's enhanced extriangulated theory, we introduce the notion of cohomological envelope of an exact dg category and generalize his enhanced ideal quotient. We indeed show that the dg quotient of exact dg categories passing to the cohomological envelope and substructures, where we call it the exact dg subquotient, enjoys compatibility with a wide class of extriangulated quotients in the sense of Nakaoka-Ogawa-Sakai. To utilize and clarify the range of our approach, we formulate the extriangulated subquotient which permits us to localize any extriangulated category by extension-closed subcategories. It includes not only both the ideal quotient and the Verdier quotient, but the quotient of an exact category by biresolving subcategories. Notably the extriangulated subquotient is lifted to the exact dg subquotient."
2505.15532,Global well-posedness of 2D incompressible MHD equations without magnetic diffusion,['math.AP'],"['Shijin Ding', 'Ronghua Pan', 'Yi Zhu']","In recent years, the global existence of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem for 2D incompressible viscous MHD equations without magnetic diffusion has been proved in \cite{Ren,TZhang}, under the assumption that initial data is close to equilibrium states with nontrivial magnetic field, and the perturbation is small in some suitable spaces, say for instance, the Sobolev spaces with negative exponents. It leads to an interesting open question: Can one establish the global existence of classical solutions without the extra help from Sobolev spaces with negative exponents like its counterparts of ideal MHD ( i.e. without viscosity and magnetic diffusion), and fully dissipative MHD (i.e. with both viscosity and magnetic diffusion)? This paper offers an affirmative answer to this question. In fact, we will establish the existence of a global unique solution for initial perturbations being small in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$. The key idea is further exploring the structure of system, using dispersive effects of Alfvén waves in the direction which is transversal to the dissipation favorable direction. This motivates our key strategy to treat the wildest nonlinear terms as an artificial linear term. These observations help us to construct some interesting quantities which improves the nonlinearity order for the wildest terms, and to control them by terms with better properties."

In an electrostatic field, we establish a mathematical framework for the Neumann-Poincaré(NP) type operators for metallic nanoparticles with general geometries related to core and shell scales. We calculate the plasmon resonance frequency of concentric disk metal nanoshells with normal perturbations at the interfaces by the asymptotic analysis and perturbation theory to reveal the intrinsic hybridization between solid and cavity plasmon modes. The theoretical finding are convincingly supported by extensive numerical experiments. Our theory corroborates and strengthens that by properly enriching the materials structures as well as the underlying geometries, one can induce much richer plasmon resonance phenomena of practical significance."
2505.15509,Milstein-type methods for strong approximation of systems of SDEs with a discontinuous drift coefficient,['math.PR'],['Christopher Rauhögger'],"We study strong approximation of $d$-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a discontinuous drift coefficient driven by a $d$-dimensional
  Brownian motion $W$.
  More precisely, we essentially assume that the drift coefficient $μ$ is piecewise Lipschitz continuous with an exceptional set $Θ\subset \mathbb{R}^d$
  that is an orientable $C^5$-hypersurface of positive reach, the diffusion coefficient $σ$ is assumed to be
  Lipschitz continuous and, in a neighborhood of $Θ$, both coefficients are bounded and $σ$ is non-degenerate.
  Furthermore, both $μ$ and $σ$ are assumed to be $C^{1}$ with intrinsic Lipschitz continuous derivative on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\setminus Θ$.
  We introduce, for the first time in literature, a Milstein-type method which can be used to approximate SDEs of this type for general $d \in \mathbb{N}$ and prove
  that this Milstein-type scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $3/4-$ in terms of the number of steps. This method depends, in addition to evaluations of $W$ on a fixed grid, also on iterated integrals w.r.t. components of $W$, which can in general not be represented as functionals of $W$ evaluated at finitely many time points. We additionally prove that our suggested Milstein-type method is only dependent on evaluations of $W$ on a finite, fixed grid if $σ$ is additionally commutative.
  To obtain our main result we prove that a quasi-Milstein scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $3/4-$ in our setting if $μ$ is additionally continuous, which is of interest in itself."

Let $κ$ denote the Gaussian curvature on $H$. We consider the oscillatory integral $(κ^{1/2} σ)^\wedge$ with the damping factor $κ^{1/2}$ and prove the optimal decay estimate
  \[ |(κ^{1/2} σ)^\wedge(ξ)|\le C|ξ|^{-d/2}\]
  for $d=2,3,$ and with an extra logarithmic factor for $d=4$. Our result provides an essentially complete answer, since such decay estimates generally fail for $d \ge 5$, even for convex analytic hypersurfaces, as shown by Cowling--Disney--Mauceri--Müller. Furthermore, we prove the same estimates for $(κ^{1/2+it} σ)^\wedge$ with $C$ growing polynomially in $|t|$. As consequences, we obtain the best possible estimates for the convolution, maximal, and adjoint restriction operators associated with $H$, incorporating the mitigating factors of optimal orders. In particular, for $d=2, 3$, we prove the $L^2$--$L^{2(d+2)/(d+4)}$ restriction estimate with respect to the affine surface measure $κ^{1/(d+2)} σ$. This work was inspired by the stationary set method due to Basu--Guo--Zhang--Zorin-Kranich."
2505.15481,A conditional coalescent for diploid exchangeable population models given the pedigree,['math.PR'],"['Frederic Alberti', 'Matthias Birkner', 'Wai-Tong Louis Fan', 'John Wakeley']","We study coalescent processes conditional on the population pedigree under the exchangeable diploid bi-parental population model of \citet{BirknerEtAl2018}. While classical coalescent models average over all reproductive histories, thereby marginalizing the pedigree, our work analyzes the genealogical structure embedded within a fixed pedigree generated by the diploid Cannings model. In the large-population limit, we show that these conditional coalescent processes differ significantly from their marginal counterparts when the marginal coalescent process includes multiple mergers. We characterize the limiting process as an inhomogeneous $(Ψ,c)$-coalescent, where $Ψ$ encodes the timing and scale of multiple mergers caused by generations with large individual progeny (GLIPs), and $c$ is a constant rate governing binary mergers.
  Our results reveal fundamental distinctions between quenched (conditional) and annealed (classical) genealogical models, demonstrate how the fixed pedigree structure impacts multi-locus statistics such as the site-frequency spectrum, and have implications for interpreting patterns of genetic variation among unlinked loci in the genomes of sampled individuals. They significantly extend the results of \citet{DiamantidisEtAl2024}, which considered a sample of size two under a specific Wright-Fisher model with a highly reproductive couple, and those of \citet{TyukinThesis2015}, where Kingman coalescent was the limiting process. Our proofs adapt coupling techniques from the theory of random walks in random environments."

We verify this condition for a class of $C^{1+α}$ systems using fixed point theory in space of Cantor functions, which gives first examples of truly $C^{1+α}$ IFSs with positive Fourier dimension for their attractors. Moreover, the proof method also applies in smoother parabolic Markov systems including Young tower codings leading also to power Fourier decay for conformal measures for Manneville-Pommeau maps, Lorenz maps arising from the Lorenz system, and Patterson-Sullivan measures for cusped hyperbolic surfaces, generalising the work of Bourgain and Dyatlov to geometrically finite groups with parabolic elements. The lack of smoothness preventing the traditional use of spectral gaps for transfer operators is replaced with multiscale oscillations of the derivatives on Cantor sets allowing us to reduce to exponential sums of products of random variables with finite exponential moments."

Firstly, we give the rate at which its solution decays exponentially in time to the equilibrium solution, independent of the choice of the initial datum. Secondly, as the polymer relaxation time goes to infinity (or, equivalently, the center-of mass diffusion goes to zero), we show that any family of strong solutions of the system described above, that is parametrized by the relaxation time, converges to an essentially bounded weak solution of a corotational polymer fluid-structure interaction system whose solute evolves according to the convected time derivative of its extra stress tensor. A consequence of this is a weak-strong uniqueness result."

In their paper, Cohen et al. confirmed the conjecture for cycles with two blocks and for cycles with four blocks having all its blocks of length 1. Recently, the conjecture was proved for special types of four-blocks cycles. In this paper, we confirm Cohen et al.'s conjecture for all six-blocks cycles C(k,1,1,1,1,1).

The characterization follows from an abstract statement about approximation by generalized planes in metric spaces, which also applies to the study of low-dimensional sets in Heisenberg groups. A key aspect is that the $ι$-coefficients are in general not pointwise comparable to the usual squared $β$-numbers for dyadic cubes on $k$-regular sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$, however our result implies that they are still equivalent in terms of a Carleson-type geometric lemma."

  $$C_{n}(ω_g)=\int |s_g|^n\frac{ω_g^n}{n!}$$ within the conformal class of $ω_g$. Moreover, we show that the critical metric $ω_g$ minimizes the $n$-Calabi functional within the conformal class $[ω]$. In particular,

2505.15395,Piecewise-linear Ricci curvature flows on weighted graphs,"['math.AP', 'math.DG']","['Jicheng Ma', 'Yunyan Yang']","Community detection is an important problem in graph neural networks. Recently, algorithms based on Ricci curvature flows have gained significant attention. It was suggested by Ollivier (2009), and applied to community detection by Ni et al (2019) and Lai et al (2022). Its mathematical theory was due to Bai et al (2024) and Li-Münch (2025). In particular, solutions to some of these flows have existence, uniqueness and convergence. However, a unified theoretical framework has not yet been established in this field.
  In the current study, we propose several unified piecewise-linear Ricci curvature flows with respect to arbitrarily selected Ricci curvatures. First, we prove that the flows have global existence and uniqueness. Second, we show that if the Ricci curvature being used is homogeneous, then after undergoing multiple surgeries, the evolving graph has a constant Ricci curvature on each connected component. Note that five commonly used Ricci curvatures, which were respectively defined by Ollivier, Lin-Lu-Yau, Forman, Menger and Haantjes, are all homogeneous, and that the proof of all these results is independent of the choice of the specific Ricci curvature. Third, as an application, we apply the discrete piecewise-linear Ricci curvature flow with surgeries to the problem of community detection. On three real-world datasets, the flow consistently outperforms baseline models and existing methods. Complementary experiments on synthetic graphs further confirm its scalability and robustness. Compared with existing algorithms, our algorithm has two advantages: it does not require curvature calculations at each iteration, and the iterative process converges."

Consistently, we show that these solutions belong to a broader class that includes skew brace solutions. In particular, we prove that each such solution can be decomposed as a hemi-semidirect product of a skew brace solution endowed with a certain compatible action on the idempotents of the associated di-skew brace structure.

Under the assumption of a modified Slater constraint qualification, both convergence of the primal and dual variables to a generalized Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point is proven, at least on a subsequence.

Verlinde']","We present new results on Maker-Breaker games arising from the Erdős-Szekeres problem in planar geometry. This classical problem asks how large a set in general position has to be to ensure the existence of $n$ points that are the vertices of a convex $n$-gon. Moreover, Erdős further extended this problem by asking what happens if we also require that this $n$-gon has an empty interior. In a 2-player Maker-Breaker setting, this problem inspires two main games. In both games, Maker tries to obtain an empty convex $k$-gon, while Breaker tries to prevent her from doing so. The games differ only in which points can comprise the winning $k$-gons: in the monochromatic version the points of both players can make up a $k$-gon, while in the bichromatic version only Maker's points contribute to such a polygon. Both settings are studied in this paper. We show that in the monochromatic game, Maker always wins. Even in a biased game where Breaker is allowed to place $s$ points per round, for any constant $s \geq 1$, Maker has a winning strategy. In the bichromatic setting, Maker still wins whenever Breaker is allowed to place $s$ points per round for any constant $s<2$. This settles an open problem posed by Aichholzer et al. (2019). Furthermore, we show that there are games that are not a lost cause for Breaker. Whenever $k\ge 8$ and Breaker is allowed to play 12 or more points per round, she has a winning strategy. We also consider the one-round bichromatic game (a.k.a.\ the offline version).

We determine the minimum size $\varphi_3(n)$ of a set $\mathcal{E}$ of triples such that for every 3-partition $X,Y,Z$ of the set $\{1,\dots,n\}$, there is some $\{x,y,z\}\in \mathcal{E}$ with $x\in X$, $y\in Y$, and $z\in Z$. In particular, $$\varphi_3(n)=\left\lceil{\frac{n(n-2)}{3}}\right\rceil.$$ For $d>3$, one may define an analogous number $\varphi_d(n)$. We determine the order of magnitude of $\varphi_d(n)$, and prove the following upper and lower bounds, for $d>3$: $$\frac{2 n^{d-1}}{d!} -o(n^{d-1}) \leq \varphi_d(n) \leq \frac{0.86}{(d-1)!}n^{d-1}+o(n^{d-1}).$$"

If $n\geq 5$, it may be chosen in addition injective, hence a proper conformal minimal embedding. Prescribing its flux, as a consequence, every nonflat conformal minimal immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ is homotopic to the real part of a proper holomorphic null embedding $M\to\mathbb{C}^n$.

2505.15346,More on the Concept of Anti-integrability for Hénon Maps,['math.DS'],"['Zin Arai', 'Yi-Chiuan Chen']","For the family of Hénon maps $(x,y)\mapsto (\sqrt{a}(1-x^2)-b y,x)$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$, the so-called anti-integrable (AI) limit concerns the limit $a\to\infty$ with fixed Jacobian $b$. At the AI limit, the dynamics reduces to a subshift of finite type. There is a one-to-one correspondence between sequences allowed by the subshift and the AI orbits. The theory of anti-integrability says that each AI orbit can be continued to becoming a genuine orbit of the Hénon map for $a$ sufficiently large (and fixed Jacobian).
  In this paper, we assume $b$ is a smooth function of $a$ and show that the theory can be extended to investigating the limit $\lim_{a\to\infty} b/\sqrt{a}=\hat{r}$ for any $\hat{r}>0$ provided that the one dimensional quadratic map $x\mapsto \displaystyle\frac{1}{\hat{r}}(1-x^2)$ is hyperbolic."

Starting from a minimal list of axioms, we model each algebra as an object in a small cartesian closed category $\mathcal{A}$ and define a transfinite evolution functor $φ\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{A}$. We prove that the fixed point $φ^{\infty}$ exists for every initial object and satisfies an internal universal property that recovers familiar constructs -- limits, colimits, adjunctions -- while extending them to ordinal-indexed folds. A sequence of theorems establishes (i) soundness and conservativity over standard universal algebra, (ii) convergence of $φ$-iterates under regular cardinals, and (iii) an explanatory correspondence between $φ^{\infty}$ and minimal sufficient statistics in information-theoretic AI models. We conclude by outlining computational applications: type-safe functional languages, categorical model checking, and signal-level reasoning engines that leverage Alpay Algebra's structural invariants. All proofs are self-contained; no external set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC are required. This exposition positions Alpay Algebra as a bridge between foundational mathematics and high-impact AI systems, and provides a reference for further work in category theory, transfinite fixed-point analysis, and symbolic computation."

We consider two different normalizations of Hermite polynomials: the standard one (i.e. $\tilde H_n=H_n$), and $\tilde H_n=H_n/(2^nn!)$ (so that $q_n$ are Appell polynomials: $q_n'=q_{n-1}$). In both cases, we show the key role played by the polynomial $P(x)=\sum_{j=0}^Kγ_jx^{K-j}$ to solve this problem. In particular, if all the zeros of $P$ are real then all the zeros of $q_n$, $n\ge K$, are also real."

  If \( f(z) \) is a transcendental meromorphic solution of the equation with subnormal growth, then we derive all possible forms of the equation. Additionally, under these assumptions, we classify these specific forms based on the degrees of \( P(z, f(z)) \) and \( Q(z, f(z)) \) to establish necessary conditions for the existence of transcendental meromorphic solutions. In particular, when the degree of \( P \) minus the degree of \( Q \) is 2, we demonstrate that the equation reduces to a Riccati differential equation. Finally, examples are provided to support our results."

Moreover, assuming semi-ampleness of isotropic nef divisors, which holds true for all hyper-Kähler manifolds of known deformation types, we show that there are only finitely many such projective families up to isomorphism. These results are optimal since we can construct infinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic (not necessarily projective) families of smooth hyper-Kähler varieties over some pointed curve $(B, 0)$ such that they are all isomorphic over the punctured curve $B\backslash \{0\}$ and have isomorphic fibers over the base point $0$."

Jerison [JK82] added a Smirnov-type condition to the definition of this class.
  In this note, we show that this Smirnov-type condition is equivalent to an $H^1$-integrability condition. As a consequence, one of the conditions in the definition of $AE$ can be dropped. We use this simplification to apply C. Kenig's theory to prove results about weighted Hardy spaces. These are useful to study the Neumann problem in $Ω$ with boundary data in weighted spaces."

Because no separation of variables into a basis of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues exists for the time harmonic problem, we introduce a related approximate operator for the Dirichlet Laplacian in the exterior of a torus. The approximate operator coincides with the Schrödinger operator with a Pöschl-Teller potential and agrees with the Dirichlet Laplacian to leading order. The operator here which we develop is related to the so-called Mehler-Fock kernel. Using the known solution to the eigenvector and eigenvalue problem of Pöschl-Teller, a high-frequency analysis of the approximate operator for the wave equation can be made accurately. The operator for this problem gives a close approximation to the $L^1\rightarrow L^{\infty}$ dispersive estimate at a suitable small distance from the torus for the corresponding exterior wave operator with Dirichlet Laplacian."

Since then, several works investigated the properties of the random interlacements intersected with large sets of~$\mathbb{Z}^d$.
  In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the capacity of $\mathscr{I}(u) \cap D_N$, where $D_N$ is the blow up of a compact set $D$, with typical size $N$. We determine the correct window $(u_N)_{N\geq 1}$ of the intensity parameter for which the capacity $\mathrm{cap}(\mathscr{I}(u_N)\cap D_N)$ starts to become negligible compared to $\mathrm{cap}(D_N)$; this roughly means that a random walk starting from far away starts to see through $\mathscr{I}(u_N)\cap D_N$.
  In the same spirit, we investigate the capacity of the simple random walk conditioned to stay in a large Euclidean ball up to time $t_N$, and find similar asymptotics by taking $t_N = u_N N^d$."

The study of these values is a classic problem in number theory and ramification theory. However, the classic results focus on tame, and in particular defectless, extensions. In this paper we focus on the study of defect extensions. We want to compare the number of such values to invariants of $θ$. The main invariant we have in mind is the depth of $θ$. We present various examples that show that, in the defect case, none of the equivalent of the classic results are true. We also discuss the relation between the number of such values and the number of ramification ideals of the extension $(K(θ)/K,v)$. In order to do so, we present some results about ramification ideals that have interest on their own."

The starting point is a hereditary order which can be interpreted as a smoothing of the finite-dimensional algebra obtained from the restriction to a ramified point. We construct a triangulated subcategory inside the derived category of this finite-dimensional algebra which provides a deformation absorption of singularities. This allows us to obtain a semiorthogonal decomposition of the bounded derived category of the hereditary order, which is in addition linear over the base."

The MAR model, by maintaining a matrix structure and requiring significantly fewer parameters than vector autoregressive (VAR) models, offers a parsimonious, yet effective, alternative for high-dimensional time series. Empirical results demonstrate that MAR models estimated via the proposed methods achieve a comparable fit to VAR models across metrics such as MAE and RMSE.

For the Riemannian version, by allowing small perturbations of the magnetic potential, we use the Runge Approximation Theorem to show that the metric can be uniquely determined. There is no gauge equivalence in this case. For the Lorentzian version, we use microlocal analysis to construct the trajectory of null-geodesics via generic perturbations of the electromagnetic potential, hence the conformal class of the metric can be constructed. Moreover, we also show, in the Lorentzian case, the same result can be obtained using generic perturbations of the metric itself."

2505.15168,Equilibrium models to analyse the impact of different coordination schemes between TSO and DSOs on market power in sequentially-cleared energy and ancillary services markets under load and renewable generation uncertainty,['math.OC'],"['Giovanni Micheli', 'Maria Teresa Vespucci', 'Gianluigi Migliavacca', 'Dario Siface']","The current massive installation of distributed resources in electricity distribution systems is transforming these systems into active dispatching subjects. At the same time, the need to compensate for the intermittent generation of an increasing amount of renewable sources creates the need to acquire more ancillary services. Flexible resources in the distribution system could provide these services not only within the perimeter of the distribution network to which they are connected but also for the benefit of the transmission system. However, this requires Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to coordinate their dispatching actions effectively. One critical aspect of this coordination is establishing a market architecture that limits market power. This paper presents an innovative game-theoretic approach to compare different TSO-DSO coordination models for acquiring ancillary services from distribution resources. Several schemes are considered: some with coordinated market management by TSOs and DSOs, others with sequential or independent local markets. For each scheme, the dispatching problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic sequential game, where the first stage is the day-ahead market and the second stage is the balancing market. Nash equilibrium solutions are obtained by iteratively solving the profit maximization problem of each market player. Numerical tests on a CIGRE benchmark network show that coordination schemes enabling distribution resources to provide ancillary services to the transmission system can significantly increase system costs when congestion occurs in the transmission network."

Long-term uncertainties, such as investment and maintenance costs of different technologies, are combined with short-term uncertainties, including solar radiation, electricity prices, and uncontrolled load variations. We formulate the problem as a multistage multi-horizon stochastic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, minimizing the total cost of a domestic building complex's energy system. The model integrates long-term investment decisions, such as the capacity of photovoltaic panels and battery energy storage systems, with short-term operational decisions, including energy dispatch, grid exchanges, and load supply. To ensure robust operation under extreme scenarios, first- and second-order stochastic dominance risk-averse measures are considered preserving the time consistency of the solution. Given the computational complexity of solving the stochastic MILP for large instances, a rolling horizon-based matheuristic algorithm is developed. Additionally, various lower-bound strategies are explored, including wait-and-see schemes, expected value approximations, multistage grouping and clustering schemes. Extensive computational experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on a case study based on a building complex in South Germany, tackling models with over 20 million constraints, 5 million binary variables, and 6 million continuous variables."

The first-stage decisions concern investments in new plants, new connections in the electricity and gas sectors, and the decommissioning of existing thermal power plants; the second-stage variables represent operational decisions, with uncertainty about future fuel and CO2 prices represented by scenarios. The main features of the model are: (i) the bidirectional conversion between electricity and gas enabled by Power-to-Gas and thermal power plants, (ii) a detailed representation of short-term operation, crucial for addressing challenges associated with integrating large shares of renewables in the energy mix, and (iii) an integrated planning framework to evaluate the operation of flexibility resources, their ability to manage non-programmable generation, and their economic viability. Given the computational complexity of the proposed model, in this paper we also implement a solution algorithm based on Benders decomposition to compute near-optimal solutions. A case study on the decarbonisation of the Italian integrated energy system demonstrates the effectiveness of the model. The numerical results show: (i) the importance of including a detailed system representation for obtaining reliable results, and (ii) the need to consider price uncertainty to design adequate systems and reduce overall costs."

We then construct a complete set of orthogonal idempotents in the category of $\mathbb{C}^\times$-fibered $p$-biset functors, leading to a categorical decomposition of this category into subcategories indexed by isomorphism classes of atoric $p$-groups. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of vertices for indecomposable functors and establish that the Ext-groups between simple functors with distinct vertices vanish. As an application, we describe a set containing composition factors of the monomial Burnside functor, thereby providing new insights into its structure. Additionally, we develop a technique for analyzing fibered biset functors via their underlying biset structures."

A bone $B_i$ is the tree obtained by attaching two pendent edges to each of the end vertices of a path $P_{i}$. The local independence number of $G$, denoted by $α_l(G)$, is defines as the maximum integer $t$ such that $G$ contains an induced star $K_{1,t}$. Motivated by the seminal works of Scott and Seymour~(2016), Chudnovsky et al. (2017, 2020) on finding special types of holes in graphs with large chromatic number and bounded clique number, we establish an analog result by finding special types of bones in graphs with large deficiency and bounded local independence number. Fujita et al. (2006) proved that $\kd(G)\le n-2$ if $G$ is a connected graph with $α_l(G)<n$ and containing no bones.

An algorithm that constructs large matchings and establishes an upper bound on the deficiency is also provided."

Precisely, we prove that every semistable Higgs bundle is strongly semistable for curves of genus $g\leq 1$, and over any curves of genus $g\ge2$ construct explicit examples of semistable Higgs bundles of arbitrary big rank (the first example is $p=2,r=3$) which are not strongly semistable. These results are complementary to the strongly semistability theorem of Lan-Sheng-Yang-Zuo and Langer for semistable Higgs bundles of small rank."
2505.15131,On Discounted Infinite-Time Mean Field Games,"['math.OC', 'math.PR']","['Zeyu Yang', 'Yongsheng Song']","In this paper, we study the infinite-time mean field games with discounting, establishing an equilibrium where individual optimal strategies collectively regenerate the mean-field distribution. To solve this problem, we partition all agents into a representative player and the social equilibrium. When the optimal strategy of the representative player shares the same feedback form with the strategy of the social equilibrium, we say the system achieves a Nash equilibrium.
  We construct a Nash equilibrium using the stochastic maximum principle and infinite-time forward-backward stochastic differential equations(FBSDEs). By employing the elliptic master equations, a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs , we provide a representation for the Nash equilibrium. We prove the Yamada-Watanabe theorem and show the weak uniqueness for infinite-time FBSDEs. And we prove that the solutions to a system of infinite-time FBSDEs can be employed to construct viscosity solutions for a class of distribution-dependent elliptic PDEs."

A similar result holds for volume preserving maps and also in Stein manifolds with the density property. This generalizes several results in the literature and provides a considerably simpler proof."

We establish global well-posedness in the energy space for subcritical, mass-critical, and energy-critical regimes, using Strichartz estimates, Hardy inequalities, and Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type estimates. For sufficiently large damping, we highlight how the interplay between damping, singular potentials, and inhomogeneity influences the dynamics. Our results extend existing studies and offer new insights into the long-time behavior of solutions in this more general setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the combined effects of inverse-square potential, inhomogeneous (or even homogeneous) nonlinearity, and damping in the context of the NLS equation."

We provide a rigorous convergence analysis establishing a global convergence rate of O(1/k) under mild conditions, requiring only convexity and local Lipschitz differentiability of the objective function. Our method enables adaptive parameter selection for the inertial term without manual tuning. Furthermore, we derive the particular form of the inertial term that transforms AIM into a new Quasi-Newton method. Notably, under specific circumstances, AIM coincides with the regularized Newton method, achieving an accelerated rate of O(1/k^2) without Hessian inversions. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that AIM exhibits superior performance across diverse optimization problems, highlighting its practical effectiveness."

Two mixed variables (the stress tensor and the velocity of the acoustic wave) are included while the symmetry of the stress tensor is imposed weakly by considering the antisymmetric part of the strain tensor (the spin or vorticity tensor) as an additional unknown. Convergence of the method is demonstrated and theoretical rates are obtained; numerical results suggesting optimal order of convergence and superconvergence of the traces are presented.

First, for $2<p<4$, we prove the existence of normalized solutions to (NLDE) using a perturbation argument. Then, for $p \geq 4$, we establish the assumption under which normalized solutions to (NLDE) exist. Finally, we extend these results to the case $a<0$ and, for all $p>2$, prove the existence of normalized solutions to (NLDE) when $λ= -mc^2$ is an eigenvalue of the operator $\mathcal{D}$. In the Appendix, we study the influence of the parameters $m, c > 0$ on the existence of normalized solutions to (NLDE). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the normalized solutions to (NLDE) on metric graphs."
2505.15099,A Stiff Order Condition Theory for Runge-Kutta Methods Applied to Semilinear ODEs,['math.NA'],"['Steven B. Roberts', 'David Shirokoff', 'Abhijit Biswas', 'Benjamin Seibold']","Classical convergence theory of Runge-Kutta methods assumes that the time step is small relative to the Lipschitz constant of the ordinary differential equation (ODE). For stiff problems, that assumption is often violated, and a problematic degradation in accuracy, known as order reduction, can arise. Methods with high stage order, e.g., Gauss-Legendre and Radau, are known to avoid order reduction, but they must be fully implicit. For the broad class of semilinear ODEs, which consist of a stiff linear term and non-stiff nonlinear term, we show that weaker conditions suffice. Our new semilinear order conditions are formulated in terms of orthogonality relations and can be enumerated by rooted trees. Finally, we prove global error bounds that hold uniformly with respect to stiffness of the linear term."

For the non-negative parameter regime ($α\ge 0$), we present a direct proof based on trace Sobolev inequalities and eigenfunction estimates. The case of negative parameters ($α<0$) requires novel analytical techniques to handle $L^\infty$ estimates of Robin eigenfunctions, addressing challenges not present in the non-negative case. Our result extends the the classical Dirichlet and Neumann cases to the less-studied negative parameter regime."

We first establish the global existence of strong solutions to the one-dimensional isothermal Navier-Stokes system for smooth initial data without any smallness conditions, assuming that the initial density has strictly positive lower bound. The existence result allows for possibly degenerate viscosity coefficients and admits different asymptotic states at the far fields. We then prove a contraction property for the strong solutions perturbed from viscous shocks, yielding uniform estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficients. This covers any large perturbations, and consequently, we establish the inviscid limits and their stability estimate. In other words, we demonstrate the stability of Riemann shocks to the one-dimensional isothermal Euler system in the class of vanishing viscosity limits of the associated Navier-Stokes system."

In this paper, we consider simulated tempering combined with an arbitrary local Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and present a new decomposition theorem that provides a lower bound on the restricted spectral gap of the algorithm for sampling from mixture distributions. By working with the restricted spectral gap, the applicability of our results is extended to broader settings such as when the usual spectral gap is difficult to bound or becomes degenerate. We demonstrate the application of our theoretical results by analyzing simulated tempering combined with random walk Metropolis--Hastings for sampling from mixtures of Gaussian distributions. Our complexity bound scales polynomially with the separation between modes, logarithmically with $1/\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the target accuracy in total variation distance, and exponentially with the dimension $d$."
2505.15056,An ideal-sparse generalized moment problem reformulation for completely positive tensor decomposition exploiting maximal cliques of multi-hypergraphs,['math.OC'],"['Pengfei Huang', 'Minru Bai']","In this paper, we consider the completely positive tensor decomposition problem with ideal-sparsity. First, we propose an algorithm to generate the maximal cliques of multi-hypergraphs associated with completely positive tensors. This also leads to a necessary condition for tensors to be completely positive. Then, the completely positive tensor decomposition problem is reformulated into an ideal-sparse generalized moment problem. It optimizes over several lower dimensional measure variables supported on the maximal cliques of a multi-hypergraph. The moment-based relaxations are applied to solve the reformulation. The convergence of this ideal-sparse moment hierarchies is studied. Numerical results show that the ideal-sparse problem is faster to compute than the original dense formulation of completely positive tensor decomposition problems. It also illustrates that the new reformulation utilizes sparsity structures that differs from the correlative and term sparsity for completely positive tensor decomposition problems."

Most of the literature focuses on learning only the objective function, as learning the constraint function (i.e., feasible regions) leads to nonconvex training programs. Motivated by this, we focus on learning feasible regions for known linear objectives and introduce two training losses along with a hypothesis class to parameterize the constraint function. Our hypothesis class surpasses the previous objective-only method by naturally capturing discontinuous behaviors in input-decision pairs. We introduce a customized block coordinate descent algorithm with a smoothing technique to solve the training problems, while for further restricted hypothesis classes, we reformulate the training optimization as a tractable convex program or mixed integer linear program. Synthetic experiments and two power system applications, including comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches, showcase and validate the proposed approach."

To address this class of problems, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework based on singular perturbation analysis, tailored to settings with constrained dynamics. Our approach relies on the theory of viscosity solutions for degenerate Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with Neumann-type boundary conditions. We also establish the convergence of the multiscale value functions in the infinite-horizon regime. Finally, we present two illustrative examples that highlight the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed framework."
2505.14973,Customized Interior-Point Methods Solver for Embedded Real-Time Convex Optimization,"['math.OC', 'eess.SY']","['Jae-Il Jang', 'Chang-Hun Lee']","This paper presents a customized convex optimization solver tailored for embedded real-time optimization, which frequently arise in modern guidance and control (G&C) applications. The solver employs a practically efficient predictor-corrector type primal-dual interior-point method (PDIPM) combined with a homogeneous embedding framework for infeasibility detection. Unlike conventional homogeneous self-dual embedding formulations, the adopted approach can directly handle quadratic cost functions without requiring problem reformulation. To support a systematic workflow, we also develop a code generation tool that analyzes the sparsity pattern of the provided problem family and generates customized solver code using a predefined code template. The generated solver code is written in C with no external dependencies other than the standard library math.h, and it supports complete static allocation of all data. Additionally, it provides parsing information to facilitate the use of the solver API by end users. Benchmark results and numerical experiments on an embedded platform demonstrate that the developed solver outperforms existing solvers in both efficiency and reliability."
2505.14966,On the optimal Sobolev threshold for evolution equations with rough nonlinearities,['math.AP'],"['Ben Pineau', 'Mitchell A. Taylor']","In this article we are concerned with evolution equations of the form \begin{equation*} \partial_tu-A(D)u=F(u,\overline{u},\nabla u, \nabla \overline{u}) \end{equation*} where $A(D)$ is a Fourier multiplier of either dispersive or parabolic type and the nonlinear term $F$ is of limited regularity. Our objective is to develop a robust set of principles which can be used in many cases to predict the \emph{highest} Sobolev exponent $s=s(q,d)$ for which the above evolution is well-posed in $W_x^{s,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ (necessarily restricting to $q=2$ for dispersive problems). We will confirm the validity of these principles for two of the most important model problems; namely, the nonlinear Schrödinger and heat equations. More precisely, we will prove that the nonlinear heat equation \begin{equation*} \partial_tu-Δu=\pm |u|^{p-1}u, \hspace{5mm} p>1, \end{equation*} is well-posed in $W_x^{s,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ when $\max\{0,s_c\}<s<2+p+\frac{1}{q}$ and is \emph{strongly ill-posed} when $s\geq \max\{s_c,2+p+\frac{1}{q}\}$ and $p-1\not\in 2\mathbb{N}$ in the sense of non-existence of solutions even for smooth, small and compactly supported data. When $q=2$, we establish the same ill-posedness result for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the corresponding well-posedness result when $p\geq \frac{3}{2}$. Identifying the optimal Sobolev threshold for even a single non-algebraic $p>1$ was a rather longstanding open problem in the literature. As an immediate corollary of the fact that our ill-posedness threshold is dimension independent, we may conclude by taking $d\gg p$ that there are nonlinear Schrödinger equations which are ill-posed in \emph{every} Sobolev space $H_x^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$."

We investigate the existence of such modules and prove that, over rings that are neither regular nor principal ideal rings, every positive syzygy module of the residue field is full-trace. Moreover, over Cohen-Macaulay rings, we study full-trace Ulrich modules--that is, maximally generated maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are full-trace. We establish the following characterization: a non-regular Cohen-Macaulay local ring has minimal multiplicity if and only if it admits a full-trace Ulrich module. Finally, for numerical semigroup rings with minimal multiplicity, we show that each full-trace Ulrich module decomposes as the direct sum of the maximal ideal and a module that is either zero or Ulrich."

2505.14957,Strong Formulations and Algorithms for Regularized A-optimal Design,['math.OC'],['Yongchun Li'],"We study the Regularized A-optimal Design (RAOD) problem, which selects a subset of $k$ experiments to minimize the inverse of the Fisher information matrix, regularized with a scaled identity matrix. RAOD has broad applications in Bayesian experimental design, sensor placement, and cold-start recommendation. We prove its NP-hardness via a reduction from the independent set problem. By leveraging convex envelope techniques, we propose a new convex integer programming formulation for RAOD, whose continuous relaxation dominates those of existing formulations. More importantly, we demonstrate that our continuous relaxation achieves bounded optimality gaps for all $k$, whereas previous relaxations may suffer from unbounded gaps. This new formulation enables the development of an exact cutting-plane algorithm with superior efficiency, especially in high-dimensional and small-$k$ scenarios. We also investigate scalable forward and backward greedy algorithms for solving RAOD, each with provable performance guarantees for different $k$ ranges. Finally, our numerical results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed exact and approximation algorithms. We further showcase the practical effectiveness of RAOD by applying it to a real-world user cold-start recommendation problem."
2505.14952,"Smooth atlas stratified spaces, K-Homology Orientations, and Gysin maps","['math.DG', 'math.AT', 'math.KT']","['Pierre Albin', 'Markus Banagl', 'Paolo Piazza']","We introduce smooth atlas stratified spaces. We show that this class is closed under cartesian products; consequently, it is possible to define fiber bundles of smooth atlas stratified spaces. We describe the resolution of such a space to a manifold with fibered corners and use this result in order to prove that the class of smooth atlas stratified spaces coincides with that of Thom-Mather stratified spaces.
  We then consider Witt pseudomanifolds (such as singular complex algebraic varieties) where it is well-known that a bordism invariant signature is available and equal to the Fredholm index of a realization of the signature operator. To each oriented fiber bundle of stratified spaces, with Witt fibers, we assign a class in bivariant KK-theory (with 2 inverted). Kasparov multiplication by this element defines a Gysin map in analytic K-homology and one of our main results is that this Gysin map preserves the analytic signature class of Witt spaces. We prove in fact a more general result: functoriality for fiber bundles in the sense that if one fiber bundle is the composition of two others then the KK-class of the former is the Kasparov product of the classes of the latter. We also discuss this result for other Dirac-type operators satisfying an analytic Witt condition, for example the spin-Dirac operator on a fibration of psc-Witt spin pseudomanifolds. We next define the analytic Gysin map associated to an oriented normally non-singular inclusion of Witt spaces and prove that it also preserves the signature class.
  Finally, we relate the analytic signature class of a Witt space with the topological Siegel-Sullivan orientation. Specifically we show that if one applies the inverse of the second Adams operation to the Sullivan orientation and complexifies then one obtains our analytic signature class under the natural identification between analytic and topological K-homology."

Here, $Ω$ is a John domain in a metric measure space satisfying a doubling condition and a $p$-Poincaré inequality, and $\nabla u$ is the Cheeger gradient. The regularity results obtained in this paper improve on earlier estimates proved by the authors in \cite{CGKS} for the study of the Neumann problem, and have applications to the regularity of solutions of nonlocal PDE in doubling metric spaces.

Oliynyk'],"We consider a linear Schrödinger operator $H = -Δ+ V$ with a strongly singular potential $V$ not bounded from below on a non-compact incomplete Riemannian manifold $M$. We assume that the negative part of potential $V_{-}$ is measurable, and it does not necessarily belong to either local Kato or Stummel classes, and we define new geometric conditions on the growth of $V_{-}$ in a special $\textit{range control neighborhood (RCN)}$ such that $H$ is semibounded from below on functions compactly supported in these neighborhoods. We define RCN by means of $\textit{an inner time metric}$ which estimates the minimal time for a classical particle to travel between any two points on $M$, and we assume that $M$ is complete w.r.t. this metric, i.e. the potential $V$ is classically complete on $M$. For the corresponding Cauchy problem of the wave equation $u_{tt} + Hu = 0$, we define locally a Lorentzian metric such that its light cone is formed along the minimizing curves with respect to the inner time metric, where both an energy inequality and uniqueness of solutions hold. Inversely, for well-known Lorentzian metrics of static black holes - Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, and de Sitter metrics - we study the wave equations for the corresponding Schrödinger operators, and we show that the event horizons of these black holes belong to the RCNs of infinity w.r.t. the inner time metrics, and that all solutions of the mixed problems stay in these neighborhoods indefinitely long."

In particular, it is proved that the $Σ^0_3$ relation of computable isomorphism of structures on $\N$ in a computable first-order language is $Π^0_2$-graphable, i.e., is the connectedness relation of a $Π^0_2$ graph. Graphings of Friedman-Stanley jumps are studied, including an arithmetical construction of a graphing of the Friedman-Stanley jump of $E$ from a graphing of $E$."
2505.14909,The Fast Newton Transform: Interpolation in Downward Closed Polynomial Spaces,['math.NA'],"['Phil-Alexander Hofmann', 'Damar Wicaksono', 'Michael Hecht']","We present the Fast Newton Transform (FNT), an algorithm for performing $m$-variate Newton interpolation in downward closed polynomial spaces with time complexity $\mathcal{O}(|A|m\overline{n})$. Here, $A$ is a downward closed set of cardinality $|A|$ equal to the dimension of the associated downward closed polynomial space $Π_A$, where $\overline{n}$ denotes the mean of the maximum polynomial degrees across the spatial dimensions $m$. For functions being analytic in an open Bernstein poly-ellipse, geometric approximation rates apply when interpolating in non-tensorial Leja-ordered Chebyshev-Lobatto or Leja grids. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, we utilize $\ell^p$-sets, with the $l^2$-Euclidean case turning out to be the pivotal choice, leading to $|A|/(n+1)^m \in \mathcal{O}(e^{-m})$. Expanding non-periodic functions, the FNT complements the approximation capabilities of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Choosing $\ell^2$-sets for $A$ renders the FNT time complexity to be less than the FFT time complexity $\mathcal{O}((n+1)^m m \log(n))$ in a range of $n$, behaving as $\mathcal{O}(e^m)$. Maintaining this advantage true for the differentials, the FNT sets a new standard in $m$-variate interpolation and approximation practice."
2505.14908,A Spectral Turán Problem for a Fixed Tree,['math.CO'],"['Dheer Noal Desai', 'Hemanshu Kaul', 'Bahareh Kudarzi']","We study the spectral Turán problem for trees. To avoid limiting our perspective to specific families of trees, we parametrize trees in terms of their unique bipartition. We say $T \in \mathcal{T}_{m,l+1}^δ$ if $T$ is a tree of order $m$, where the order of the smaller partite set $A$ of $T$ is $l+1$, and $δ$ is the minimum degree of the vertices in $A$. The motivation for this parametrization comes from the recent proof of the spectral Erdős-Sós conjecture. For a given fixed tree $T$, we describe $\mathrm{SPEX}(n,T)$ and consequently, bound $\mathrm{spex}(n,T)$ in terms of $m,l,δ$ for that tree. Our approach combines spectral arguments with new results and constructions on embedding a tree $T \in \mathcal{T}_{m,l+1}^δ$ into graphs of the form $\overline{K}_l \vee m S_δ$. We give bounds on $\mathrm{spex}(n,T)$ within an error of $Θ(n^{-1/2})$ and $Θ(n^{-1})$ that are based on our embedding results for the given $T$."

In this note we use this fact to compute the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of the normal bundle of a general such curve $C$ in $\mathbb{P}^{g-1}$. We also compute the Harder-Narasimhan filtration of the Normal bundle of a general canonical curve of genus $6$.

Braid varieties are interesting affine algebraic varieties indexed by positive braid words. It was proved recently that braid varieties are cluster varieties.

In particular, we show that their character series are a sum of super Schur functions $s_λ(\mathbf{q}/\mathbf{u})$ times irreducible characters of $G$ with universal coefficients, which do not depend on $k,j$. In the case where $G$ is the symmetric group with diagonal action, this proves the ""Diagonal Supersymmetry"" conjecture of Bergeron (2020)."
2505.14883,L-resolvents of symmetric linear relations in Pontryagin spaces,"['math.FA', 'math.SP']",['Volodymyr Derkach'],"Let A be a closed symmetric operator with the deficiency index (p,p), $p<\infty$, acting in a Hilbert space H and let L be a subspace of H. The set of L-resolvents of a densely defined symmetric operator in a Hilbert space with a proper gauge L was described by Krein and Saakyan. The Krein--Saakyan theory of L-resolvent matrix was extended by Shmul'yan and Tsekanovskii to the case of improper gauge L and by Langer and Textorius to the case of symmetric linear relations in Hilbert spaces. In the present paper we find connections between the theory of boundary triples and the Krein--Saakyan theory of L-resolvent matrices for symmetric linear relations with improper gauges in Pontryagin spaces. We extend the known formula for the L-resolvent matrix in terms of boundary operators to this class of relations. The results are applied to the minimal linear relation generated by a canonical system."

We first present an algorithm for the value evaluation of finite-memory feedback policies. We provide error bounds derived from filter stability and projection errors. We then study the learning of finite-memory based near-optimal Q values. Convergence in this case requires further assumptions on the exploration policy when using general basis functions. We then show that these assumptions can be relaxed for specific models such as those with perfectly linear cost and dynamics, or when using discretization based basis functions."

2505.14865,Regular polygons,['math.MG'],['J. Mainik'],"The construction of regular polygons with a compass and straightedge is a well-known task and this problem has interested mathematicians for a long time. In particular, for a long time they could not answer the question of whether is it possible to construct a regular 17-gon with a compass and straightedge. C. F. Gauss solved this problem in 1796. He proved later that it is possible to construct with a compass and straightedge the regular polygons with $n=2^m n_1\cdots n_l$ sides, where $n_1,\cdots, n_l$ are different prime numbers of the form $\; n_k=2^{2^{ν_k}}+1$. P. Wantzel proved in 1837 that only these regular polygons can be constructed. Essential is here the construction of the regular polygons with $n_k=2^{2^{ν_k}}+1$ sides. The currently known prime numbers of the form $n=2^{2^ν}+1$ are $3, 5, 17, 257$ and $65537$. In the paper we present a new approach for solving this task. Among other things we analyze in detail the case of $n=65537$. J. G. Hermes announced in 1894 that he had a full description of the construction of the 65537-gon. This was the result of 10 years of work, but his text was too extensive and was never published. We show exactly and without gaps how the regular 65537-gon can be constructed."

Krylov'],"In recent years we witness growing interest in using Real Analysis methods and results in the theory of nondivergence form partial differential equations (PDEs) and the goal of this article is to give a brief and concise introduction into the applications of several results in Real Analysis to the theory of elliptic and parabolic equations in Sobolev and Morrey-Sobolev spaces. In particular, we concentrate on such results as Hardy-Littlewood maximal function theorem, Fefferman-Stein theorem, theory of Muckenhoupt weights, and Rubio de Francia extrapolation theorem and their role in Sobolev or Morrey-Sobolev space theory of parabolic equations with mixed norms.
  In our exposition we do not try to give the strongest known results for particular equations in particular spaces. We only show how the Real Analysis results, we present with all proofs, can be used in model cases such as the Laplace and the heat equations with singular first order terms. The only exception is the last section where we present new results."
2505.14860,Optimization and the Topology of Spaces of Parseval Frames,"['math.FA', 'math.OC', 'math.SG']","['Anthony Caine', 'Tom Needham', 'Clayton Shonkwiler']","A Parseval frame is a spanning set for a Hilbert space which satisfies the Parseval identity: a vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the frame whose coefficients are inner products with the frame vectors. There is considerable interest within the signal processing community in the structural properties of the space of finite-dimensional Parseval frames whose vectors all have the same norm, or which satisfy more general prescribed norm constraints. In this paper, we introduce a function on the space of arbitrary spanning sets that jointly measures the failure of a spanning set to satisfy both the Parseval identity and given norm constraints. We show that, despite its nonconvexity, this function has no spurious local minimizers, thereby extending the Benedetto--Fickus theorem to this non-compact setting. In particular, this shows that gradient descent converges to an equal norm Parseval frame when initialized within a dense open set in the associated matrix space. We then apply this result to study the topology of frame spaces. Using our Benedetto--Fickus-type result, we realize spaces of Parseval frames with prescribed norms as deformation retracts of simpler spaces, leading to explicit conditions which guarantee the vanishing of their homotopy groups. These conditions yield new path-connectedness results for spaces of real Parseval frames, generalizing the Frame Homotopy Theorem, which has seen significant interest in recent years."
2505.14856,On quantitative linear gravitational relaxation,"['math.AP', 'math-ph']","['Mahir Hadzic', 'Matthew Schrecker']","We prove quantitative decay rates for the linearised Vlasov-Poisson system around compactly supported equilibria. More precisely, we prove decay of the gravitational potential induced by the radial dynamics of this system in the presence of a point mass source. Our result can be interpreted as the gravitational version of linear Landau damping in the radial setting and hence the first linear asymptotic stability result around such equilibria. We face fundamental obstacles to decay caused by the presence of stable trapping in the problem. To overcome these issues we introduce several new ideas. We use different tools, including the Birkhoff-Poincaré normal form, action-angle type variables, and delicate resolvent bounds to prove a suitable version of the limiting absorption principle and obtain the decay-in-time."

The decomposition through eigenfunctions, integral representation using orthogonal projectors, and functional calculus are established. The results generalize Mercer theorem for positive definite kernels. The proofs rely on the gluing of projector-valued measures, presented in separate lemmas.

We use these defects as a model for the quantum decorated character stacks of arXiv:2102.12283, thus extending them to 3-manifolds with surface defects. As a special case we obtain knot invariants closely related to the ``quantum $A$-polynomial"", and we give a concrete method for computation resembling the approach of Dimofte and collaborators based on ideal triangulations and gluing equations."

King', 'Kylie Schnoor']","In this paper, we explore a correspondence between frames with rational eigensteps and semistandard Young tableaux (SSYT), via the relation assigning a Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern to a frame via the frame's eigensteps. We will identify how certain key structures in SSYTs correlate with particular frame properties. For example, the weight of an SSYT yields the sequence of norms of any compatible frame. Additionally, this correspondence leads to a novel way to construct the eigensteps of a frame coming solely from tableaux. This is an alternative to the Top Kill algorithm which may be viewed as a combinatorial reinterpretation of the algorithm. We further employ other combinatorial techniques such as the boxcomp method to generate a ``complement"" SSYT. On the frame side, this corresponds to a tight frame's Naimark complement as well as to a generalization of the Naimark complement for non-tight frames. Further research points to an analysis of equiangular tight frames and their corresponding tableaux, as well as using more combinatorial operations to further analyze frames."

We identify examples of partial cubes whose Varchenko determinants lack a clean factorization, as well as those that exhibit such a structure.

A key contribution of this work is the development of new techniques for deriving a priori estimates in this generalized setting, which reduce the original finite graph to a graph with only two vertices. This reduction enables us to explicitly compute the Brouwer degree and to establish the existence of solutions when the degree is nonzero. Furthermore, using the method of sub- and supersolutions, we also prove the existence of solutions in cases where the Brouwer degree vanishes."

We aim to illustrate the applicability of Carleman estimates to establish exact controllability of such equations and derive Lipschitz stability estimates for inverse problems of source terms and coefficients with general dynamic boundary conditions. We highlight the challenges associated with dynamic boundary conditions compared to classical static ones. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open problems and future research directions."
2505.14790,Generalised Burnside and Dixon algorithms for irreducible projective representations,"['math.RT', 'cs.MS', 'cs.SC']",['Attila Szabó'],"Based on the recently proposed character theory of projective representations of finite groups proposed, we generalise several algorithms for computing character tables and matrices of irreducible linear representations to projective representations. In particular, we present an algorithm based on that of Burnside to compute the characters of all irreducible projective representations of a finite group with a given Schur multiplier, and transpose it to exact integer arithmetic following Dixon's character table algorithm. We also describe an algorithm based on that of Dixon to split a projective representation into irreducible subspaces in floating-point arithmetic, and discuss how it can be used to compute matrices for all projective irreps with a given multiplier. Our algorithms bypass the construction of the representation group of the Schur multiplier, which makes them especially attractive for floating-point computations, where exact values of the multiplier are not necessarily available."
2505.14762,Multiple radial SLE($κ$) and quantum Calogero-Sutherland system,"['math.PR', 'math-ph']",['Jiaxin Zhang'],"We develop a theory for the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(κ)$ systems with parameter $κ> 0$ -- a family of random multi-curve systems in a simply connected domain $Ω$, with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial Ω$ and a marked interior point $q$.
  As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that such systems are characterized by equivalence classes of partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, one can always choose a conformally covariant representative.
  When $Ω$ is taken to be the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ and the marked interior point $q$ is set at the origin, we demonstrate that the partition function satisfies a system of second-order PDEs, known as the null vector equations, with a null vector constant $h$ and a rotation equation involving a constant $ω$.
  Motivated by the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct four families of solutions to the null vector equations, which are naturally classified according to topological link patterns.
  For $κ> 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(κ)$ systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero--Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the states built upon the fermionic states."

First of all, by applying the Poisson equation method, we prove that the slow component converges to the solution of the averaging equation in the $L^p$ ($p\geq 2$) space with the optimal convergence order $\frac12$. Then we establish a central limit theorem for these systems and derive the weak convergence rate using the Poisson equation technique and the regularity properties of the associated Cauchy problem."

Our proof introduces a link-type semi-invariant that remains unchanged under all moves except the fifth, highlighting its necessity in generating the full move set. Second, we extend the algebraic toolkit for immersed surface-links. After revisiting the banded-unlink description of immersed surfaces and the twelve local moves that relate their diagrams, we develop a biquandle-based coloring theory. By assigning elements of a biquandle to diagram arcs according to local rules, we obtain a counting invariant of immersed surfaces up to isotopy. Third, we show that there are infinitely many pairs of ribbon $2$-knots with isomorphic groups but different knot quandles."

The construction, following previous work for curves on projective spaces, essentially proceeds by blowing up Ciocan-Fontanine--Kim's space of quasimaps at loci where sections of line bundles are linearly dependent. We conjecture that tautological intersection numbers on these moduli spaces give enumerative counts of curves of fixed complex structure on $X$ subject to general incidence conditions, in contrast with traditional compactifications of the moduli spaces of maps. A result of Farkas guarantees that these spaces are pure of expected dimension. The conjecture is proven in dimension 2, where the main input is a Brill-Noether theorem for general curves on toric surfaces."

For $k\geq 2$ the proof relies on an $\mathbb{R}^k$-generalization of a Lipschitz refinement of the Bebutov--Kakutani theorem proven by Gutman, Jin and Tsukamoto.

  heterostructures that feature magnetic skyrmions -- tiny whirls of
  spins with non-trivial topology -- in each magnetic layer. Such
  magnetic heterostructures have been recently pursued as possible
  hosts of room temperature stable magnetic skyrmions suitable for the
  next generation of low power information technologies and
  unconventional computing. The presence of stacked skyrmions in the
  adjacent layers gives rise to a strongly coupled nonlinear system,
  whereby the induced magnetic field plays a crucial stabilizing
  role. Starting with the micromagnetic modeling framework, we derive
  a general reduced energy functional for a fixed number of ultrathin
  ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular magnetocrystalline
  anisotropy. We next investigate this energy functional in the regime
  in which the energy is dominated by the intralayer exchange
  interaction and formally obtain a finite-dimensional description
  governed by the energy of a system of one skyrmion per layer as a
  function of the position, radius and the rotation angle of each of
  theses skyrmions. For the latter, we prove that energy minimizers
  exist for all fixed skyrmion locations. We then focus on the
  simplest case of stray field-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and
  completely characterize the energy minimizers. We show that the
  global energy minimizers exist and consist of two stray
  field-stabilized Néel skyrmions with antiparallel in-plane
  magnetization components. We also calculate the energy of two
  skyrmions of equal radius as a function of their separation
  distance."

We propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate in terms of a first-order stationary metric and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks."

In contrast to many previous works, the domain is not assumed to be simply-connected and the fluxes are not assumed to be small. In this very general setting, we prove the existence of a solution with a uniformly bounded Dirichlet integral in every compact subset. This is a generalization of the classical Ladyzhenskaya-Solonnikov result obtained under the additional assumption of zero boundary conditions. For small data of the problem we also prove the unique solvability and attainability of Couette-Poiseuille flows at infinity. The main novelty of our approach is the proof of the corresponding Leray-Hopf-type inequality by Leray's reductio ad absurdum argument (since the standard Hopf cutoff extension procedure does not work for general boundary data). For this contradiction approach, we use some fine properties of weak solutions to the Euler system based on Morse-Sard-type theorems in Sobolev spaces obtained by Bourgain, Korobkov & Kristensen."

2505.14624,Parabolic quantum affine algebras,"['math.QA', 'math.RT']","['Kudret Bostanci', 'Deniz Kus']","Maximal parabolic subalgebras of untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebras were studied in the context of Borel-de Siebenthal theory in [13], where they were realized as certain equivariant map algebras with a non-free abelian group action. In this paper, we show that this perspective naturally extends to non-maximal parabolic subalgebras and introduce their quantum analogues - called parabolic quantum affine algebras - in analogy with ordinary quantum affine algebras and their classical counterpart, the loop algebra. While the definition in the Drinfeld-Jimbo presentation is straightforward, the realization in Drinfeld's second presentation requires quantum root vectors associated not only to simple roots but also to certain non-simple roots. A distinguished positive root $γ_0$ plays a central role in all constructions. Along the way, we construct a PBW-type basis, establish a second triangular decomposition, and determine the action of the braid group on the Cartan part of the algebra via Lusztig's automorphisms. Finally, we classify the finite-dimensional irreducible representations under a technical condition on $γ_0$, referred to as repetition-free, in terms of Drinfeld polynomials with some additional data. The key difference from the ordinary quantum affine case is that the degrees of the polynomials are only bounded by a certain highest weight, rather than being uniquely determined by it. In the maximal parabolic case, the classification can alternatively be phrased in terms of Drinfeld polynomials satisfying certain divisibility conditions."

In particular, we show that typically the number of subgraphs becomes exponential when $p$ passes $1/n$, reaches maximum possible base of exponent (asymptotically) when $p\gg 1/n$, and reaches the asymptotic value $2^n$ when $p$ passes $2\ln n/n$. For $p\gg \ln n/n$, we get the first order term and asymptotics of the second order term of $μ(G(n,p))$. We also prove that random regular graphs $G_{n,d}$ typically have $μ(G_{n,d})\geq 2^{c_d n}$ for all $d\geq 3$ and some positive constant $c_d$ such that $c_d\to 1$ as $d\to\infty$."

Quasi-modular forms are special types of multiple $q$-zeta values. In this paper, we generalize this result of Bloch and Okounkov and prove that certain other traces are related to multiple $q$-zeta values. A simple case of our main results asserts that if $x = e^z$ and $y = e^w$, then $$ \frac{(xq)_\infty (yq)_\infty}{(q)_\infty (xyq)_\infty}, $$ which appears in [CW, Theorem 5] as a trace (the deformed Bloch-Okounkov $1$-point function), is a formal power series in $z$ and $w$ whose coefficient for $z^mw^n$ is a multiple $q$-zeta value (in the sense of [BK3, Oko]) of weight $(m+n)$."
2505.14602,The Lamplighter Group is Not Semistable at Infinity,['math.GR'],['Michael Mihalik'],"The question of whether or not all finitely presented groups are semistable at infinity has been studied for over 40 years. In 1986, we defined what it means for a finitely generated group to be semistable at infinity - in analogy with the definition for finitely presented groups. At that time we suggest that the Lamplighter group may not be semistable at infinity, but until now there was no confirmed example of a finitely generated group that is not semistable at infinity. We prove the Lamplighter group is not semistable at infinity. Finitely generated non-semistable groups may be important in finding non-semistable finitely presented groups via ascending HNN extensions. There is an ascending HNN extension E of the Lamplighter group (called the Extended Lamplighter group) that is finitely presented. It would seem that E is a candidate to be a finitely presented non-semistable at infinity group, but a result of N. Silkin, shows that E is in fact simply connected at infinity."

  Second, we show that the separatrices of node and focus basins (sinks and sources) exhibit a finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in [The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows, K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions.
  Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices."
2505.14586,Remarks on the quadratic Hessian equation,['math.AP'],['Connor Mooney'],"We prove that viscosity solutions to the quadratic Hessian equation $$σ_2(D^2u) = 1$$ cannot touch a harmonic function on a minimal surface from below. This can be viewed as a form of strict $2$-convexity. We also prove an a priori interior $C^2$ estimate in terms of the $W^{2,\,p}$ norm, for any $p > 2$. Finally, we discuss how these results rule out certain strategies for constructing counterexamples to regularity."

We describe the group of automorphisms of A that are diagonalizable with respect to B. This group arises as the inverse limit of a functor (a diagram) from the category associated with the graph E to the category of groups. In certain cases, this group can be realized as a dyadic solenoid. Additionally, we investigate the automorphisms that permute (and possibly scale) the elements of B. In particular, for algebras satisfying the 2LI condition, we provide a complete description of their automorphism group."
2505.14559,Categorial grammars with unique category assignment,['math.LO'],"['Maxim Vishnikin', 'Alexander Okhotin']","A categorial grammar assigns one of several syntactic categories to each symbol of the alphabet, and the category of a string is then deduced from the categories assigned to its symbols using two simple reduction rules. This paper investigates a special class of categorial grammars, in which only one category is assigned to each symbol, thus eliminating ambiguity on the lexical level (in linguistic terms, a unique part of speech is assigned to each word). While unrestricted categorial grammars are equivalent to the context-free grammars, the proposed subclass initially appears weak, as it cannot define even some regular languages. It is proved in the paper that it is actually powerful enough to define a homomorphic encoding of every context-free language, in the sense that for every context-free language $L$ over an alphabet $Σ$ there is a language $L'$ over some alphabet $Ω$ defined by categorial grammar with unique category assignment and a homomorphism $h \colon Σ\to Ω^+$, such that a string $w$ is in $L$ if and only if $h(w)$ is in $L'$. In particular, in Greibach's hardest context-free language theorem, it is sufficient to use a hardest language defined by a categorial grammar with unique category assignment."
2505.14550,Harmonic problems arising from continuous time random walks limit processes,['math.PR'],"['Ivan Biočić', 'Bruno Toaldo']","In this paper, we develop a universal method that identifies the (non-local) governing evolution equations for Continuous Time Random Walks' (CTRWs) limit processes. Given one of these processes, our method provides the form of a non-local operator, acting on space and time variables jointly, such that the (generalized) harmonic problem associated with it represents an evolution governing equation for this process. Then, the well-posedness of this problem must be established case by case. In this paper, we establish well-posedness when the process is a Feller process (on a general Polish space $E$) time-changed with the overshooting of a subordinator. Also, we will show how our method applies to several cases when the equation and its well-posedness are already known, hence unifying several different approaches in the literature."

We construct a complex controlling the deformation of the monoidal structure on $\mathcal{C}$ together with the deformation of the underlying dg-category itself. We show that in the case of a semisimple category $\mathcal{C}$ it reduces to the Davydov-Yetter complex. Furthermore, we study this complex in several special cases, in particular, in the case of the category of $A$-modules over a commutative algebra $A$ we obtain a complex computing operadic $E_2$-cohomology of $A$. And in the case of the category of representations of an associative bialgebra we recover the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex. In the latter case our construction can be considered as a generalization of the Gerstenhaber-Schack complex to quasi-bialgebras."

By the completeness theorem, it follows that under this assumption there is a model $M$ of $\text{PV}_1$ that contains a nonstandard number $m$ which has no prime factorization."

For the global $\ell^1 \to \ell^\infty$ decay estimate, we show that $t^{-1/3}$ decay holds under a nondegeneracy condition on the discriminant. Alternatively, for any even period $q\geq2$, if the continuous spectrum consists of exactly $q$ disjoint intervals (bands), we obtain a $t^{-1/(q+1)}$ decay rate without any further assumptions."

2505.14492,Enhancing Multi-Energy Modeling: The Role of Mixed-Integer Optimization Decisions,['math.OC'],"['Stephanie Riedmüller', 'Annika Buchholz', 'Janina Zittel']","The goal to decarbonize the energy sector has led to increased research in modeling and optimizing multi-energy systems. One of the most promising techniques for modeling (multi-)energy optimization problems is mixed-integer programming (MIP), valued for its ability to represent the complexities of integrated energy systems. While the literature often focuses on deriving mathematical formulations and parameter settings, less attention is given to critical post-formulation decisions. Modeling multi-energy systems as a MIP demands decisions across multiple degrees of freedom. Key steps include reducing a real-world multi-energy network into an abstract topology, defining variables, formulating the relevant (in-)equalities to represent technical requirements, setting objectives, and integrating these elements into a MIP. However, with these elements fixed, the specific transformation of the abstract topology into a graph structure and the construction of the MIP remain non-uniquely. These choices can significantly impact user-friendliness, problem size, and computational efficiency, thus affecting the feasibility and efficiency of modeling efforts. We identify and analyze the additional degrees of freedom and describe two distinct approaches to address them. The approaches are compared regarding mathematical equivalence, suitability for solution algorithms, and clarity of the underlying topology. A case study on a realistic subarea of Berlin's district heating network involving tri-objective optimization for a unit commitment problem demonstrates the practical significance of these decisions. By highlighting these critical yet often overlooked aspects, our work equips energy system modelers with insights to improve computational efficiency, scalability, and interpretability in their optimization efforts."

We also give projective models for singular Jacobian Kummer varieties of arbitrary dimension. Along the way, we also construct a first non-natural involution on the Hilbert square of a Jacobian surface. In the appendix, we study singularities of secants of arbitrary varieties at identifiable points, following Choi, Lacini, Park and Sheridan."

This enables us to describe the entire structure of an abstract Witt ring with $2^n$ square classes in terms of a unique $n\times n$ matrix. Via computational search, we find all these matrices for $n$ up to $7$ with the exception of a few cases of $n=7$ associated with Witt rings of level at least $4$.

2505.14458,Adaptive Estimation of the Transition Density of Controlled Markov Chains,['math.ST'],"['Imon Banerjee', 'Vinayak Rao', 'Harsha Honnappa']","Estimating the transition dynamics of controlled Markov chains is crucial in fields such as time series analysis, reinforcement learning, and system exploration. Traditional non-parametric density estimation methods often assume independent samples and require oracle knowledge of smoothness parameters like the Hölder continuity coefficient. These assumptions are unrealistic in controlled Markovian settings, especially when the controls are non-Markovian, since such parameters need to hold uniformly over all control values. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive estimator for the transition densities of controlled Markov chains that does not rely on prior knowledge of smoothness parameters or assumptions about the control sequence distribution. Our method builds upon recent advances in adaptive density estimation by selecting an estimator that minimizes a loss function {and} fitting the observed data well, using a constrained minimax criterion over a dense class of estimators. We validate the performance of our estimator through oracle risk bounds, employing both randomized and deterministic versions of the Hellinger distance as loss functions. This approach provides a robust and flexible framework for estimating transition densities in controlled Markovian systems without imposing strong assumptions."

Kanat Camlibel', 'Raffaella Carloni', 'Henk J. van Waarde']","In this study, we propose new global stabilization approaches for a class of polynomial systems in both model-based and data-driven settings. The existing model-based approach guarantees global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system only when the Lyapunov function is radially unbounded, which limits its applicability. To overcome this limitation, we develop a new global stabilization approach that allows a broader class of Lyapunov function candidates. Furthermore, we extend this approach to the data-driven setting, considering Lyapunov function candidates with the same functional structure. Using data corrupted by bounded noise, we derive conditions for constructing globally stabilizing controllers for unknown polynomial systems. Beyond handling noise, the proposed data-driven approach can be readily adapted to incorporate further prior knowledge of system parameters to reduce conservatism. In both approaches, sum-of-squares relaxation is used to ensure computational tractability of the involved conditions."

2505.14430,Prox-PINNs: A Deep Learning Algorithmic Framework for Elliptic Variational Inequalities,['math.OC'],"['Yu Gao', 'Yongcun Song', 'Zhiyu Tan', 'Hangrui Yue', 'Shangzhi Zeng']","Elliptic variational inequalities (EVIs) present significant challenges in numerical computation due to their inherent non-smoothness, nonlinearity, and inequality formulations. Traditional mesh-based methods often struggle with complex geometries and high computational costs, while existing deep learning approaches lack generality for diverse EVIs. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces Prox-PINNs, a novel deep learning algorithmic framework that integrates proximal operators with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve a broad class of EVIs. The Prox-PINNs reformulate EVIs as nonlinear equations using proximal operators and then approximate the solutions via neural networks that enforce boundary conditions as hard constraints. Then the neural networks are trained by minimizing physics-informed residuals. The Prox-PINNs framework advances the state-of-the-art by unifying the treatment of diverse EVIs within a mesh-free and scalable computational architecture. The framework is demonstrated on several prototypical applications, including obstacle problems, elasto-plastic torsion, Bingham visco-plastic flows, and simplified friction problems. Numerical experiments validate the method's accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and flexibility across benchmark examples."

One says that a dynamical system $(X,f)$ is surjunctive if every injective endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is surjective. An endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is called pre-injective if its restriction to each $f$-homoclinicity class of $X$ is injective. One says that a dynamical system has the Moore property if every surjective endomorphism of the system is pre-injective and that it has the Myhill property if every pre-injective endomorphism is surjective. One says that a dynamical system satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem if it has both the Moore and the Myhill properties. We prove that every irreducible Smale space satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem and that every non-wandering Smale space is surjunctive and has the Moore property."

However, its computational complexity necessitates effi-cient solution methods. In this work we propose a framework to accelerate the solving process of the UCP, and the data collecting process for two dis-tinct graph neural network (GNN) policy. We at first train a Neural Initial Commitment Prediction policy to obtain an initial commitment for UCP. Sec-ond, a heuristic process is introduced to restore the feasibility of the initial commitment. Third, get the neighborhood based on the initial prediction then neighborhood search to improve the commitment. At last, we train a Neural neighborhood Prediction policy to predict the neighborhood of the incum-bent commitment at each iteration, continuously optimizing the commitment until the stopping condition is met. This approach produces high-quality ini-tial commitments that can be iteratively refined to meet higher accuracy re-quirements. The experimental results show that the GNN policies trained on the 80-unit system outperform commercial solvers on a 1080-unit system, and LNS performs better than commercial solver on more complex instanc-es."

In accordance with the work of Chu, if an infinite sum of this form admits a closed form, then this provides a formula of Ramanujan type. Chu has introduced remarkable results on formulas of Ramanujan type, through the use of accelerations based on $Ω$-sums related to classical hypergeometric identities. Building on our past work on an acceleration method due to Wilf relying on inhomogeneous difference equations derived from Zeilberger's algorithm, we extend this method through what we refer to as an iterative approach that is inspired by Chu's accelerations derived using iteration patterns for well-poised $Ω$-sums and that we apply to introduce and prove many accelerated formulas of Ramanujan type for universal constants, along with many further accelerations related to the discoveries of Ramanujan, Guillera, and Chu."

This line of research falls under the umbrella of Erdős-Ko-Rado (EKR) problems, but poses some extra difficulty on the algebraic level compared to aforementioned classical results. From the building theory point of view, it can be seen as a variation of the center conjecture for spherical buildings due to Tits, where we replace the convexity assumption by a maximality condition.
  In previous work, general upper bounds on the size of families of non-opposite flags were obtained by applying eigenvalue and representation-theoretic techniques to the Iwahori-Hecke algebras of non-exceptional buildings. More recently, the classification of families reaching this upper bound in type $A_n$, for $n$ odd, was accomplished by Heering, Lansdown, and Metsch. For buildings of type $B$, the corresponding Iwahori-Hecke algebra is more complicated and depends non-trivially on the type and rank of the underlying polar space. Nevertheless, we are able to find a uniform method based on antidesigns and obtain classification results for chambers (i.e.\ maximal flags) in all cases, except type $^2A_{4n-3}$."

The framework is that of a smooth metric measure space $(\mathscr M,g,dμ)$ with invariant weighted measure $dμ=e^{-φ} dv_g$ and diffusion operator $Δ_φ=e^φ{\rm div} (e^{-φ} \nabla)$ -- the $φ$-Laplacian. The nonlinear slow diffusion equation, then, for $x \in {\mathscr M}$ and $t>0$, and fixed exponent $p>1$, takes the form \begin{equation*} \partial_t u (x,t) - Δ_φu^p (x,t) = \mathscr N (t,x,u(x,t)). \end{equation*} We assume that the metric tensor $g$ and potential $φ$ are space-time dependent; hence the same is true of the usual metric and potential dependent differential operators and curvature tensors. The estimates are established under natural lower bounds on the Bakry-Émery $m$-Ricci curvature tensor and the time derivative of metric tensor. The curious interplay between geometry, nonlinearity and evolution and their influence on the estimates is at the centre of this investigation. The results here considerably extend and improve earlier results on slow diffusion equations. Several implication, special cases and corollaries are presented and discussed."

The key point is defining the root functor of a dendroidal set $X$, a functor from the dendroidal nerve of a discrete operad $\mathbfΩ/X$ into $X$, which we show to be an operadic weak equivalence after localizing $\mathbfΩ/X$. This extends an analogous result for $\infty$-categories due to Joyal: when $X$ is a simplicial set, $\mathbfΩ/X$ is its category of elements, and the root functor is the last vertex map. As an application, we deduce that the $\infty$-category of algebras over an $\infty$-operad is equivalent to that of locally constant algebras over its discrete resolution."

Within the framework of radially symmetric solutions, we prove that if initial mass is less than $64π^2$, then solution is globally bounded; for any $m$ exceeding $64π^2$, there exist nonnegative initial data with prescribed mass $m$ such that the corresponding classical solutions exhibit a formation of Dirac-delta type singularity in finite time, termed a chemotactic collapse."

This technique can also be extended to analyze certain continuous function-valued segment processes associated with the numerical methods, facilitating the numerical approximation of invariant measures of SDDEs. To illustrate the application of these results, we specifically investigate the backward and truncated Euler-Maruyama methods. Several numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results."

The idempotent graph $I(R)$ is the graph whose vertex set consists of the non-trivial idempotent elements of $R$, where two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $xy = yx = 0$. The clean graph $Cl(R)$ is a graph whose vertices are of the form $(e, u)$, where $e$ is an idempotent element and $u$ is a unit of $R$. Two distinct vertices $(e,u)$ and $(f, v)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = fe = 0$ or $uv = vu = 1$. The graph $Cl_2(R)$ is the subgraph of $Cl(R)$ induced by the set $\{(e, u) : e \text{ is a nonzero idempotent element of } R\}$. In this study, we examine the structure of clean graphs over $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ derived from their $Cl_2$ graphs and investigate their relationship with the structure of their idempotent graphs."
2505.14247,Subshifts on groups and computable analysis,"['math.DS', 'cs.IT', 'math.GR', 'math.LO', 'math.MG']",['Nicanor Carrasco-Vargas'],"The study of subshifts on groups different from $\mathbb{Z}$, such as $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, has been a subject of intense research in recent years. These investigations have unveiled aremarkable connection between dynamics and recursion theory. Different questions about the dynamics of these systems have been answered in recursion-theoretical terms. In this work we further explore this connection. We use the framework of computable analysis to explore the class of effective dynamical systems on metric spaces, and relate these systems to subshifts of finite type (SFTs) on groups. We prove that every effective dynamical system on a general metric space is the topological factor of an effective dynamical system with topological dimension zero. We combine this result with existing simulation results to obtain new examples of systems that are factors of SFTsWe also study a conjugacy invariant for subshifts on groups called Medvedev degree. This invariant is a complexity measure of algorithmic nature. We develop the basic theory of these degrees for subshifts on arbitrary finitely generated groups. Using these tools we are able to classify the values that this invariant attains for SFTs and other classes of subshifts on several groups. Furthermore, we establish a connection between these degrees and the distribution of isolated points in the space of all subshifts. Motivated by the study of Medvedev degrees of subshifts, we also consider translation-like actions of groups on graphs. We prove that every connected, locally finite, and infinite graph admits a translation by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be chosen transitive exactly when the graph has one or two ends. This generalizes a result of Seward about translation-like actions of $\mathbb{Z}$ on finitely generated groups."

Consequently, both $(X, S)$ and $(X, T)$ share the same increasing sequence of pro-nilfactors. For minimal $\mathbb{R}$-flows, we introduce the concept of higher-order regionally proximal relations and nilfactors, and establish that nilfactors are characteristic factors for minimal $\mathbb{R}$-flows, up to almost one to one extensions."

We show that if a point configuration $Q$ has the property that all finite chirotopes realizable by adding (generic) points to $P$ are also realizable by adding points to $Q$, then $P$ and $Q$ are equal up to a direct affine transform. We also show that for any point configuration $P$ and any $\varepsilon>0$, there is a finite, (generic) extension $\widehat P$ of $P$ with the following property: if another realization $Q$ of the chirotope of $P$ can be extended so as to realize the chirotope of $\widehat P$, then there exists a direct affine transform that maps each point of $Q$ within distance $\varepsilon$ of the corresponding point of $P$."

  where $N \geqslant 6$, $2^*=2 N /(N-2)$ is the critical Sobolev exponent, $ρ>0$ is a given small constant and $λ_ρ>0$ acts as an Euler-Lagrange multiplier. For any $k\in \mathbb{R}^+$, we construct a $k$-spike solutions in some suitable bounded domain $Ω$. Our results extend those in \cite{BHG3,DGY,SZ}, where the authors obtained one or two positive solutions corresponding to the (local) minimizer or mountain pass type critical point for the energy functional of above equation. Furthermore, using blow-up analysis and local Pohozaev identities arguments, we prove that the $k$-spike solutions are locally unique. Compared to the standard Brézis-Nirenberg problem without the mass constraint, an additional difficulty arises in estimating the error caused by the differences in the Euler-Lagrange multipliers corresponding to different solutions. We overcome this difficulty by introducing novel observations and estimates related to the kernel of the linearized operators."

We introduce a way of expanding complex numbers in base $α$ with digits in $\D$ that we call $α$-expansions, which generalize rational base number systems introduced by Akiyama, Frougny and Sakarovitch, and are related to rational self-affine tiles introduced by Steiner and Thuswaldner. We define an algorithm to obtain the expansions for certain Gaussian integers and show results on the language. We then extend the expansions to all $x \in \C$ (or $x \in \R$ when $α= \ab \in \Q$, the rational case will be our starting point) and show that they are unique almost everywhere. We relate them to tilings of the complex plane. We characterize $α$-expansions in terms of $p$-adic completions of $\Q(i)$ with respect to Gaussian primes."
2505.14138,Sample Complexity of Correlation Detection in the Gaussian Wigner Model,['math.ST'],"['Dong Huang', 'Pengkun Yang']","Correlation analysis is a fundamental step in uncovering meaningful insights from complex datasets. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting correlations between two random graphs following the Gaussian Wigner model with unlabeled vertices. Specifically, the task is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem: under the null hypothesis, the two graphs are independent, while under the alternative hypothesis, they are edge-correlated through a latent vertex permutation, yet maintain the same marginal distributions as under the null. We focus on the scenario where two induced subgraphs, each with a fixed number of vertices, are sampled. We determine the optimal rate for the sample size required for correlation detection, derived through an analysis of the conditional second moment. Additionally, we propose an efficient approximate algorithm that significantly reduces running time."

We introduce and study (in the framework of lattice-ordered spaces) the notions of total order-boundedness and uniform total order-boundedness. Either one generalizes the concept of ordinary precompactness known from metric space theory. These new notions are then used to define and characterize ""compact extensions"" of general measure-preserving systems (with no restrictions on the underlying probability spaces nor on the acting groups). In particular, it is (re)proved that compact extensions and extensions with discrete spectrum are one and the same thing. Finally, we show that under natural hypotheses a subset of a Kaplansky-Banach module is totally order bounded if and only if it is cyclically compact (in the sense of Kusraev)."

We introduce a suitable normalization of this flow so that nearly $G_2$-structures are stable under rescaling. However, we show that many nearly $G_2$-structures are unstable for this flow: specifically, all those naturally arising from 3-Sasakian geometry. In particular, we demonstrate that the standard nearly $G_2$-structure on the round 7-sphere is an unstable critical point with high index."

We generalize his result to more general algebraic (co)homology theories having the Mackey property and admitting localization long exact sequences. In general, the pieces are indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Our construction is based on some result about a decomposition of the rational Burnside ring of a finite group, which stands behind the classical splitting theorems for equivariant spectra in stable equivariant homotopy theory.
  Applying this result to the case of Borne's modular K-theory we exhibit a case where the splitting is indexed by not necessarily abelian subgroups."

This upper bound is obtained by bounding from above the density of the tetrahedra which can appear in the additively-weighted Delaunay decomposition of the sphere centers of such packings. The proof relies on challenging computer calculations in interval arithmetic and may be of interest by their own.

First, we establish the existence of solutions in the Musielak-Orlicz space.

These quasi-interpolants will be formed with special linear combinations of shifts of the new radial functions and we will provide explicit expressions for their coefficients. In establishing these new radial basis functions we will also use other, new classes of shifted thin-plate splines and multiquadrics of  [11], [12].

2505.14060,Variably Scaled Kernels for the regularized solution of the parametric Fourier imaging problem,['math.NA'],"['Anna Volpara', 'Alessandro Lupoli', 'Emma Perracchione']","We address the problem of approximating parametric Fourier imaging problems via interpolation/ extrapolation algorithms that impose smoothing constraints across contiguous values of the parameter. Previous works already proved that interpolating via Variably Scaled Kernels (VSKs) the scattered observations in the Fourier domain and then defining the sought approximation via the projected Landweber iterative scheme, turns out to be effective. This study provides new theoretical insights, including error bounds in the image space and properties of the projected Landweber iterative scheme, both influenced by the choice of the scaling function, which characterizes the VSK basis. Such bounds then suggest a smarter solution for the definition of the scaling functions. Indeed, by means of VSKs, the information coded in an image reconstructed for a given parameter is transferred during the reconstruction process to a contiguous parameter value. Benchmark test cases in the field of astronomical imaging, numerically show that the proposed scheme is able to regularize along the parameter direction, thus proving reliable and interpretable results."

Among the various types of copulas, Ratio-Type Copulas have gained significant attention due to their flexibility in modeling joint distributions. This paper focuses on Separate Ratio-Type Copulas, where the dependence function is a separate product of univariate functions. We revisit a theorem characterizing the validity of these copulas under certain assumptions, generalize it to broader settings, and examine the conditions for reversing the theorem in the case of concave generating functions. To address its limitations, we propose new assumptions that ensure the validity of separate copulas under specific conditions. These results refine the theoretical framework for separate copulas, extending their applicability to pure mathematics and applied fields such as finance, risk management, and machine learning."

  We use the language of abstract cone operators which are introduced and studied in a general functional analytic setting and which may be of independent interest.
  Applying our discussion to spherical suspensions of odd-dimensional closed manifolds, we generalize a Lipschitz rigidity result of the first three named authors from even to odd dimensions. Under stronger conditions, this has already been shown by Lee-Tam using geometric flows and by Baer using an upper estimate for the smallest Dirac eigenvalue."
2505.14051,Information bounds for inference in stochastic evolution equations observed under noise,['math.ST'],"['Gregor Pasemann', 'Markus Reiß']","We consider statistics for stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert space with emphasis on stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We observe a solution process under additional measurement errors and want to estimate a real or functional parameter in the drift. Main targets of estimation are the diffusivity, transport or source coefficient in a parabolic SPDE. By bounding the Hellinger distance between observation laws under different parameters we derive lower bounds on the estimation error, which reveal the underlying information structure. The estimation rates depend on the measurement noise level, the observation time, the covariance of the dynamic noise, the dimension and the order, at which the parametrised coefficient appears in the differential operator. A general estimation procedure attains these rates in many parametric cases and proves their minimax optimality. For nonparametric estimation problems, where the parameter is an unknown function, the lower bounds exhibit an even more complex information structure. The proofs are to a large extent based on functional calculus, perturbation theory and monotonicity of the semigroup generators."

However, its convergence theory is still incompletely understood.
  In this paper, we prove explicit quantitative local convergence theorems for CP-AltLS applied to orthogonally decomposable and incoherently decomposable tensors. Specifically, we show that CP-AltLS converges polynomially with order $N-1$ for $N$th-order orthogonally decomposable tensors and linearly for incoherently decomposable tensors, with convergence being measured in terms of the angles between the factors of the exact tensor and those of the approximate tensor. Unlike existing results, our analysis is both quantitative and constructive, applying to standard CP-AltLS and accommodating factor matrices with small but nonzero mutual coherence, while remaining applicable to tensors of arbitrary rank.
  We also confirm these rates of convergence numerically and investigate accelerating the convergence of CP-AltLS using an SVD-based coherence reduction scheme."

For linear PDEs, we extend the neural tangent kernel (NTK) framework for PINNs to establish global convergence guarantees for a broad class of linear operators. For nonlinear PDEs, we prove convergence to critical points via the Łojasiewicz inequality under the random feature model, eliminating the need for strong over-parameterization and encompassing both gradient flow and implicit gradient descent dynamics. Our results further reveal that the random feature model exhibits an implicit regularization effect, preventing parameter divergence to infinity. Theoretical findings are corroborated by numerical experiments, providing new insights into the training dynamics and robustness of neural network PDE solvers."

We first give counter examples showing that Gonzales' assumptions are not sufficient for a positive answer. Then we prove that it is enough to further assume that the reduced spaces of dimension four are symplectic rational surfaces and the interior fixed surfaces are restricted to at most one level. The additional assumptions allow us to use results proven by $J$-holomorphic methods. Gonzales' answer was applied by Cho in proving that if the underlying symplectic manifold is positive monotone then the space is isomorphic to a Fano manifold with a holomorphic $S^1$-action. We show that our variation is enough for Cho's application."
2505.13991,The $abc$ conjecture is true almost always,"['math.NT', 'math.AG', 'math.CO']",['Jared Duker Lichtman'],"Let ${\rm rad}(n)$ denote the product of distinct prime factors of an integer $n\geq 1$. The celebrated $abc$ conjecture asks whether every solution to the equation $a+b=c$ in triples of coprime integers $(a,b,c)$ must satisfy ${\rm rad}(abc) > K_\varepsilon\, c^{1-\varepsilon}$, for some constant $K_\varepsilon>0$. In this expository note, we present a classical estimate of de Bruijn that implies almost all such triples satisfy the $abc$ conjecture, in a precise quantitative sense. Namely, there are at most $O(N^{2/3})$ many triples of coprime integers in a cube $(a,b,c)\in\{1,\ldots,N\}^3$ satisfying $a+b=c$ and ${\rm rad}(abc) < c^{1-\varepsilon}$. The proof is elementary and essentially self-contained. Beyond revisiting a classical argument for its own sake, this exposition is aimed to contextualize a new result of Browning, Lichtman, and Teräväinen, who prove a refined estimate $O(N^{33/50})$, giving the first power-savings since 1962."

Using transportation networks as a motivating example, we introduce a novel concept that leverages domain knowledge about urban road topology -- where natural partitions often take the form of concentric rings and radial wedges. Our method reshapes the graph into a linear or circular structure to simplify the partitioning task so that we can apply sequential transformers and enables efficient learning via Proximal Policy Optimization. The resulting partitions are not only aligned with expected spatial layouts but also achieve lower normalized cuts compared to existing methods. While we focus on traffic data, our approach is broadly applicable and offers a mechanism for embedding structural priors into RL for graph partitioning."
2505.13984,On the existence of noncommutative Levi-Civita connections in derivation based calculi,"['math.QA', 'math-ph']","['Joakim Arnlind', 'Victor Hildebrandsson']","We study the existence of Levi-Civita connections, i.e torsion free connections compatible with a hermitian form, in the setting of derivation based noncommutative differential calculi over $\ast$-algebras. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Levi-Civita connections in terms of the image of an operator derived from the hermitian form. Moreover, we identify a necessary symmetry condition on the hermitian form that extends the classical notion of metric symmetry in Riemannian geometry. The theory is illustrated with explicit computations for free modules of rank three, including noncommutative 3-tori. We note that our approach is algebraic and does not rely on analytic tools such as $C^\ast$-algebra norms."

This paper focuses on symbolic computation methods for determining the $L_{\infty} $-norm of finite-dimensional linear systems, highlighting their advantages in achieving exact solutions where numerical methods often encounter limitations. Key techniques such as Sturm-Habicht sequences, Rational Univariate Representations (RUR), and Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) are surveyed, with an emphasis on their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and specific applicability to $ L_{\infty} $-norm computation. A comparative analysis is conducted between symbolic and conventional numerical approaches, underscoring scenarios in which symbolic computation provides superior accuracy, particularly in parametric cases. Benchmark evaluations reveal the strengths and limitations of both approaches, offering insights into the trade-offs involved. Finally, the discussion addresses the challenges of symbolic computation and explores future opportunities for its integration into control theory, particularly for robust and stable system analysis."

  the four triangles subdivided from the quadrilateral by
  its two diagonal lines. The first family of $C^1$-$P_k$ finite elements is the full $C^1$-$P_k$
  space on the macro-mesh. Thus the element can be applied to interface problems. The second family of $C^1$-$P_k$ finite elements condenses
  all internal degrees of freedom by moving them to the four edges. Thus the second element method has much less unknowns but is
  more accurate than the first one. We prove the uni-solvency and the optimal order convergence. Numerical tests and comparisons with the $C^1$-$P_k$ Argyris are provided."

C. Yao']","In this article, we derive an iterative scheme through a quasi-Newton technique to capture robust weakly efficient points of uncertain multiobjective optimization problems under the upper set less relation. It is assumed that the set of uncertainty scenarios of the problems being analyzed is of finite cardinality. We also assume that corresponding to each given uncertain scenario from the uncertainty set, the objective function of the problem is twice continuously differentiable. In the proposed iterative scheme, at any iterate, by applying the \emph{partition set} concept from set-valued optimization, we formulate an iterate-wise class of vector optimization problems to determine a descent direction. To evaluate this descent direction at the current iterate, we employ one iteration of the quasi-Newton scheme for vector optimization on the formulated class of vector optimization problems. As this class of vector optimization problems differs iterate-wise, the proposed quasi-Newton scheme is not a straight extension of the quasi-Newton method for vector optimization problems. Under commonly used assumptions, any limit point of a sequence generated by the proposed quasi-Newton technique is found to be a robust weakly efficient point of the problem. We analyze the well-definedness and global convergence of the proposed iterative scheme based on a regularity assumption on stationary points. Under the uniform continuity of the Hessian approximation function, we demonstrate a local superlinear convergence of the method. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Our results confirm the competition between shear heating and inelastic cooling that governs the large time behavior of temperature. Specifically, temperature increases to infinity if shear heating dominates, decreases to zero if inelastic cooling prevails, and converges to a positive constant if the two effects are balanced. In the balanced scenario, the corresponding self-similar profile aligns with the steady solution."

We also develop a semidefinite programming framework for selecting matrix parameters and demonstrate its use for designing matrix parameters which provide beneficial diagonal scaling, allow parallelization, and adhere to a given communication structure. We show that taking advantage of the linear selection operators in this way accelerates convergence in numerical experiments, and show that even when the selection operators are the identity, we can accelerate convergence by using the matrix parameters to provide appropriately chosen diagonal scaling. We conclude by demonstrating the applicability of this algorithm to multi-stage stochastic programming, outlining a decentralized approach to the relaxed stochastic weapon target assignment problem which splits over the source nodes and has low data transfer and memory requirements."

The redundancy of a probabilistic frame is defined as the dimension of the kernel of the associated synthesis operator, which turns out to be the semi-Fredholm index of the synthesis operator. For a given non-redundant probabilistic frame, we claim that the canonical dual probabilistic frame is the only dual frame of pushforward type. Furthermore, we show that probabilistic frames with finite redundancy are atomic. In the second part, we introduce approximately dual probabilistic frames and characterize all the approximate duals of pushforward type. We also study the approximately dual frames of perturbed probabilistic frames, and show that if a probability measure is close to a probabilistic dual pair in some sense, then this probability measure is an approximately dual probabilistic frame. In particular, this yields discrete approximate duals of any probabilistic frame."

We observe that a space-like or time-like surface in $N$ such that the twistor lifts are nondegenerate is given by relations among functions in the above expressions related to the second fundamental form. In the case where $N$ is a Lorentzian $4$-dimensional space form, we define the complex twistor lifts of a space-like or time-like surface in $N$ and we have analogous discussions and results in terms of the induced connection of the complexification of the two-fold exterior power of the pull-back bundle.

A fractional matching of a graph $G$ is a function $f:E(G) \rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $\sum_{e\in E_G(v)} f(e)\leq 1$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. The fractional matching number $μ_f(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum value of $ \sum_{e\in E(G)} f(e)$ over all fractional matchings.

Our analysis strengthens existing guarantees by improving the convergence rates and relaxing the theoretical assumptions previously required for dimension-independent convergence."

The uniqueness result is shown to be optimal in dimensions $d\geq 3$ by constructing different martingale solutions in the case of supercritical Lorentz drifts. As a consequence, the well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations and nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with critical singular kernels is derived. In particular, this yields the uniqueness of the 2D vorticity Navier-Stokes equations even in certain supercritical-scaling spaces. Furthermore, we prove that the path laws of solutions to McKean-Vlasov equations with critical singular kernels form a nonlinear Markov process in the sense of McKean."

The multicoloured conjecture states, roughly, that a colouring $c$ of the points of $\mathsf{PG}(n-1,q)$ containing no copy of a fixed colouring $c_0$ of $\mathsf{PG}(k-1,q)$ for small $k$ must contain a subspace of dimension polynomial in $n$ that avoids some colour.
  If $(k,q) = (2,2)$, then $c_0$ is a colouring of a three-element 'triangle', and there are three essentially different cases, all of which we resolve. We derive both the cases where $c_0$ assigns the same colour to two different elements from a recent breakthrough result in additive combinatorics due to Kelley and Meka. We handle the case that $c_0$ is a 'rainbow' colouring by proving that rainbow-triangle-free colourings of projective geometries are exactly those that admit a certain decomposition into two-coloured pieces. This is closely analogous to a theorem of Gallai on rainbow-triangle-free coloured complete graphs. We also show that existing structure theorems resolve certain two-coloured cases where $(k,q) = (2,3)$, and $(k,q) = (3,2)$."

We also show that the normalization of the closure of each symplectic leaf is isomorphic to a Calogero--Moser variety for an associated (explicit) subquotient of the symplectic reflection group. This confirms a conjecture of Bonnafé for these groups. We use the fact that the Calogero--Moser varieties associated to wreath products can be identified with certain Nakajima quiver varieties. In particular, our result identifying the normalization of the closure of each symplectic leaf with another quiver variety holds for arbitrary quiver varieties."

We demonstrate how our Julia-based implementation efficiently uses GPU parallelism through optimization of simple, but key, operations, including linear maps, adjoints, and gradient evaluations. Extensive numerical experiments across three SDP problem classes, i.e., maximum stable set, matrix completion, and phase retrieval show significant performance improvements over both CPU implementations and existing GPU-based solvers. For the largest instances, cuHALLaR achieves speedups of 30-140x on matrix completion problems, up to 135x on maximum stable set problems for Hamming graphs with 8.4 million vertices, and 15-47x on phase retrieval problems with dimensions up to 3.2 million. Our approach efficiently handles massive problems with dimensions up to (n,m) equal to (8 million, 300 million) with high precision, solving matrix completion instances with over 8 million rows and columns in just 142 seconds.

In this note, we propose an extension of this method, which is particularly suitable for proving decay for a general class of wave equations featuring a scale-critical time-dependent potential and/or first-order terms of small amplitude. Our approach consists of absorbing error terms in the $r^p$-weighted energy using a novel Grönwall argument, which allows a larger range of $p$ than the standard method. A spherically symmetric version of our strategy first appeared in [VdM22] in the context of a weakly charged scalar field on a black hole whose equations also involve a scale-critical potential."

The double-point diagram is a collection of curves and diffeomorphisms of curves, in the domain S^2, that describe the crossing data with respect to a projection, analogous to a chord diagram for a projection of a classical knot S^1 -> S^3. Our formula turns the computation of the invariant into a planar geometry problem. More generally, we describe a numerical invariant of families of knots S^j -> S^n, for all n >= j+2 and j >= 1. In the co-dimension two case n=j+2 the invariant is an isotopy invariant, and either takes values in Z or Z_2 depending on a parity issue."

Vinberg and Schwarzman showed that in the orthogonal case, if $n>10$, then it is never free. In this paper, we investigate the remaining unitary case and prove that, up to scaling, there are only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices of signature $(1, n)$ with $n > 2$ over imaginary quadratic fields with odd discriminant that admit a free algebra of modular forms. In particular, when $n>99$ (except over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, where we require $n > 154$), the graded algebra $M_*(Γ)$ is never free for any arithmetic subgroup $Γ<\operatorname{U}(1,n)$, thereby partially confirming a conjecture by Wang and Williams. As a byproduct, we also establish a finiteness result for reflective modular forms. In the course of this proof, we derive a formula for the covolume of an arithmetic subgroup of a special unitary group, presented as the stabiliser of a Hermitian lattice, which generalises Prasad's volume formula for principal arithmetic subgroups in the case of special unitary groups."
2505.13689,Piecewise linear circle maps and conjugation to rigid rational rotations,['math.DS'],"['Paul Glendinning', 'Siyuan Ma', 'James Montaldi']","Criteria for piecewise linear circle homeomorphisms to be conjugate to a rigid rotation, $x\to x+ω~({\rm mod}~1)$, with rational rotation number $ω$ are given. The consequences of the existence of such maps in families of maps is considered and the results are illustrated using two examples: Herman's classic family of piecewise linear maps with two linear components, and a map derived from geometric optics which has four components. These results show how results for piecewise smooth circle homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers have natural correspondences with the case of rational rotation numbers for piecewise linear maps. In natural families of maps the existence of a parameter value at which the map is conjugate to a rigid rotation implies linear scaling of the rotation number in a neighbourhood of the critical parameter value and no mode-locked intervals, in contrast to the behaviour of generic families of circle maps."

As in the commutative case, the resulting noncommutative effective field theories are in one-to-one correspondence with local interaction functionals. We explain how in this setting, the large $N$ correspondence discovered by 't Hooft appears as a relation between noncommutative and commutative effective field theories. As an example, we apply this framework to study a noncommutative analogue of Chern-Simons theory."
2505.13676,The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for Lorentzian Calderón problems with data on disjoint sets,['math.AP'],"['Yuchao Yi', 'Yang Zhang']","We consider the restricted Dirichlet-to-Neumann map $Λ^{U,V}_{g,A,q}$ for the wave equation with magnetic potential $A$ and scalar potential $q$, on an admissible Lorentzian manifold $(M, g)$ of dimension $n \geq 3$ with boundary. Here $U$ and $V$ are disjoint open subsets of $\partial M$, where we impose the Dirichlet data on $U$ and measure the Neumann-type data on $V$. We use the gliding rays and microlocal analysis to show that, without any a priori information, one can reconstruct the conformal class of the boundary metric $g|_{T\partial M \times T\partial M}$ and the magnetic potential $A|_{T\partial M}$ at recoverable boundary points from $Λ^{U,V}_{g,A,q}$. In particular, the conformal factor and the jet of the metric at those points are determined up to gauge transformations. Moreover, if the metric and the time orientation are known on $U$ (or $V$), then the metric on a larger portion of $V$ (or $U$) can be reconstructed, up to gauge."

Tailoring the vanilla dual gradient ascent algorithm to the Sobolev geometry, we derive a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent (SGA) algorithm to compute the barycenter for input distributions supported on a regular grid. Despite the algorithmic simplicity, we provide a global convergence analysis that achieves the same rate as the classical subgradient descent methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions in the Euclidean space. A central feature of our SGA algorithm is that the computationally expensive $c$-concavity projection operator enforced on the Kantorovich dual potentials is unnecessary to guarantee convergence, leading to significant algorithmic and theoretical simplifications over all existing primal and dual methods for computing the exact barycenter. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior empirical performance of SGA over the existing optimal transport barycenter solvers."

An ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ is called a $z^{\circ}$-ideal if $P_a\subseteq I$ for all $a\in I$. In this paper, we first investigate the class of $z^{\circ}$-ideals in non-commutative rings. We provide characterizations of $z^{\circ}$-ideals in 2-by-2 generalized triangular matrix rings, full and upper triangular matrix rings, and semiprime rings. Next, we explore new properties of the lattice $rAnn(id(R))$, the set of right annihilator ideals of $R$. We prove that $rAnn(id(R))$ forms a frame when $R$ is semiprime and a coherent frame when $R$ is a reduced ring. Furthermore, we characterize the smallest (resp., largest) right annihilator ideal contained in an ideal $I$ of an $SA$-ring $R$."

2505.13570,Minimax Rates of Estimation for Optimal Transport Map between Infinite-Dimensional Spaces,"['math.ST', 'stat.ML']","['Donlapark Ponnoprat', 'Masaaki Imaizumi']","We investigate the estimation of an optimal transport map between probability measures on an infinite-dimensional space and reveal its minimax optimal rate. Optimal transport theory defines distances within a space of probability measures, utilizing an optimal transport map as its key component. Estimating the optimal transport map from samples finds several applications, such as simulating dynamics between probability measures and functional data analysis. However, some transport maps on infinite-dimensional spaces require exponential-order data for estimation, which undermines their applicability. In this paper, we investigate the estimation of an optimal transport map between infinite-dimensional spaces, focusing on optimal transport maps characterized by the notion of $γ$-smoothness. Consequently, we show that the order of the minimax risk is polynomial rate in the sample size even in the infinite-dimensional setup. We also develop an estimator whose estimation error matches the minimax optimal rate. With these results, we obtain a class of reasonably estimable optimal transport maps on infinite-dimensional spaces and a method for their estimation. Our experiments validate the theory and practical utility of our approach with application to functional data analysis."

We characterize membership in Schatten-von Neumann ideals and compute Fredholm indices in key cases. Finally, we initiate the inverse problem of symbol recovery by spectral data, proving uniqueness and stability under mild assumptions. Several illustrative examples on \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\) and tori are worked out in detail."

The study was considered of the quasi-experimental type of descriptive cut, where a diagnostic instrument and another of satisfaction were used.

2505.13412,Counts and end-curves in two-parameter persistence,"['math.RT', 'cs.CG', 'math.AC', 'math.AT']","['Thomas Brüstle', 'Steve Oudot', 'Luis Scoccola', 'Hugh Thomas']","Given a finite dimensional, bigraded module over the polynomial ring in two variables, we define its two-parameter count, a natural number, and its end-curves, a set of plane curves. These are two-dimensional analogues of the notions of bar-count and endpoints of singly-graded modules over the polynomial ring in one variable, from persistence theory. We show that our count is the unique one satisfying certain natural conditions; as a consequence, several inclusion-exclusion formulas in two-parameter persistence yield the same positive number, which equals our count, and which in turn equals the number of end-curves, giving geometric meaning to this count. We show that the end-curves determine the classical Betti tables by showing that they interpolate between generators, relations, and syzygies. Using the band representations of a certain string algebra, we show that the set of end-curves admits a canonical partition, where each part forms a closed curve on the plane; we call this the boundary of the module. As an invariant, the boundary is neither weaker nor stronger than the rank invariant, but, in contrast to the rank invariant, it is a complete invariant on the set of spread-decomposable representations. Our results connect several lines of work in multiparameter persistence, and their extension to modules over the real-exponent polynomial ring in two variables relates to two-dimensional Morse theory."

Vastly simplified, our ears seem to prefer intervals whose frequency ratios have small numerator and denominator, such as 2:1 (octave), 3:2 (perfect fifth), 4:3 (perfect fourth), and so on. While there also have been numerous studies on the mathematics of musical chords, very few of them consider a model that measures consonance/dissonance of a given chord in analogy with this simple-fractions perspective. Our aim is to develop a measure for the consonance of a chord with crucial symmetry features, including invariance under chord translation, inversion, and interval sets. We apply our model to chords in various musical scales and compare it to existing models and empirical studies."

This paper explores certain algorithmic aspects of stochastic localization as a computational tool. First, we unify various existing stochastic localization schemes and discuss their localization rates and regularization. We then introduce a joint stochastic localization framework for constructing couplings between probability distributions. As an initial application, we extend the optimal couplings between normal distributions under the 2-Wasserstein distance to log-concave distributions and derive a normal approximation result. As a further application, we introduce a family of distributional distances based on the couplings induced by joint stochastic localization. Under a specific choice of the localization process, the induced distance is topologically equivalent to the 2-Wasserstein distance for probability measures supported on a common compact set. Moreover, weighted versions of this distance are related to several statistical divergences commonly used in practice. The proposed distances also motivate new methods for distribution estimation that are of independent interest."
2505.13396,On expectations and variances in the hard-core model on bounded degree graphs,"['math.CO', 'cs.DM']","['Ewan Davies', 'Juspreet Singh Sandhu', 'Brian Tan']","We extend the study of the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model in two novel directions. One direction gives a tight lower bound in terms of individual vertex degrees, extending work of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner and Zhao which bounds the partition function. The other bounds the variance of the size of an independent set drawn from the model, which is strictly stronger than bounding the occupancy fraction.
  In the setting of triangle-free graphs, we make progress on a recent conjecture of Buys, van den Heuvel and Kang on extensions of Shearer's classic bounds on the independence number to the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model. Sufficiently strong lower bounds on both the expectation and the variance in triangle-free graphs have the potential to improve the known bounds on the off-diagonal Ramsey number $R(3,t)$, and to shed light on the algorithmic barrier one observes for independent sets in sparse random graphs."

This transition is encoded by the behavior of the the free energy of the model, defined by $$\mathfrak f(β):=\lim_{N\to \infty} (1/n)\log W^β_n$$ where $W^β_n$ is the normalized partition function for the directed polymer of length $n$. More precisely weak disorder corresponds to $\mathfrak f(β)=0$ and strong disorder to $\mathfrak f(β)<0$. Monotonicity and continuity of $\mathfrak f$ implies that there exists $β_c\in [0,\infty]$ such that weak disorder is equivalent to $β\in [0,β_c]$. Furthermore $β_c>0$ if and only if $d\ge 3$. We prove that this transition is infinitely smooth in the sense that $\mathfrak f$ grows slower than any power function at the vicinity of $β_c$, that is $$ \lim_{β\downarrow β_c }\frac{\log |\mathfrak f(β)|}{\log (β-β_c)}=\infty.$$"

A systematic inquiry is presented, commencing with an overview of numerical entropy conservation and formulation of entropy-conserving and kinetic energy-preserving fluxes, followed by the study of their properties and efficacy. A novelty introduced is to associate numerical entropy conservation to the discretization of the energy conservation equation. Furthermore, an entropy-stable shock-capturing diffusion method and a hybrid approach utilizing the entropy distance to manage smooth regions effectively are also introduced. The addition of artificial viscosity in appropriate regions ensures entropy generation sufficient to prevent numerical instabilities. Various test cases, showcasing the efficacy and stability of the proposed methodology, are presented."

Furthermore, we develop methods to give a characterization of groups of $\mathrm{I}_Γ$-type in terms of skew braces when $Γ$ is an Artin-Tits group of spherical type and classify all groups of $\mathrm{I}_Γ$-type where $Γ$ is an irreducible spherical Artin-Tits group, therefore providing an answer to another question of Dehornoy et al. concerning $\mathrm{I}_{B_n}$ structures where $B_n$ is the braid group on $n$ strands with its canonical Garside structure."

Using tools from the calculus of variations our main result provides breathers as ground states of an indefinite functional under suitable conditions on $V, Γ$ beyond the limitations of pure $x$-periodicity. Such an approach requires a detailed analysis of the wave operator acting on time-periodic functions. Hence a generalization of the Floquet-Bloch theory for periodic Sturm-Liouville operators is needed which applies to perturbed periodic operators. For this purpose we develop a suitable functional calculus for the weighted operator $-\frac{1}{V(x)}\frac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{d}x^2}$ with an explicit control of its spectral measure. Based on this we prove embedding theorems from the form domain of the wave operator into $L^q$-spaces, which is key to controlling nonlinearities. We complement our existence theory with explicit examples of coefficient functions $V$ and temporal periods $T$ which support breathers."

Among our main considerations are the cases in which $A$ is the matrix ring over a division ring, a generalized quaternion algebra, or a semisimple finite-dimensional algebra.

In each case, the entropy in the direction of $v$ is $\mathsf E_n(v)= ρ_{\operatorname{SL}_n}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(n-i)\,v_i,$ the value of the half-sum of positive roots of $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$ evaluated at $v$. More precisely, the number of objects lying in a thin tube around the ray $\mathbb R_+v$ and of norm at most $T$ grows on the order of $ \exp\!\bigl(ρ_{\operatorname{SL}_n}(v)\,T\bigr)$ as $T\to \infty$.
  Because each eigenvalue data determines an $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$-conjugacy class, this implies a lower bound of order $\exp\!\bigl(ρ_{\operatorname{SL}_n}(v)T\bigr)$ for the number of $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$-conjugacy classes with a prescribed eigenvalue data; we also obtain an upper bound of order $\exp\!\bigl(2ρ_{\operatorname{SL}_n}(v)T\bigr)$.
  A parallel argument for the symplectic lattice $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$, taken in the symmetric direction $v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n,-v_n,\dots ,-v_1),\quad v_1>\cdots>v_n>0,$ shows that $\mathsf E_{2n}^{\operatorname{Sp}}(v)=ρ_{\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^n(n+1-i)v_i,$ the half-sum of positive roots of $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb R)$."

This bracket satisfies a graded Jacobi identity as well as two different versions of the Leibniz rule, one of them being a weak Leibniz rule, extending the well-known notions in contact geometry. In addition, we develop the multisymplectization of multicontact structures to relate these brackets to the ones present in multisymplectic geometry and obtain the field equations in an abstract context. The Jacobi bracket also permits to study the evolution of observables and study the dissipation phenomena, which we also address. Finally, we apply the results to classical dissipative field theories."

This theoretical finding demonstrates the existence of a special class of structure-adaptive optimization algorithms which are tailored for symmetry-structured inverse problems such as CT/MRI/PET, compressed sensing, and image processing applications such as inpainting/deconvolution, etc."
2505.13221,Heyde characterization theorem for some classes of locally compact Abelian groups,['math.PR'],['Gennadiy Feldman'],"Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be linear forms of real-valued independent random variables. By Heyde's theorem, if the conditional distribution of $L_2$ given $L_1$ is symmetric, then the random variables are Gaussian. A number of papers are devoted to generalisation of Heyde's theorem to the case, where independent random variables take values in a locally compact Abelian group $X$. The article continues these studies. We consider the case, where $X$ is either a totally disconnected group or is of the form $\mathbb{R}^n\times G$, where $G$ is a totally disconnected group consisting of compact elements. The proof is based on the study of solutions of the Heyde functional equation on the character group of the original group. In so doing, we use methods of abstract harmonic analysis."
2505.13206,Rapidly Varying Completely Random Measures for Modeling Extremely Sparse Networks,"['math.ST', 'stat.ML']","['Valentin Kilian', 'Benjamin Guedj', 'François Caron']","Completely random measures (CRMs) are fundamental to Bayesian nonparametric models, with applications in clustering, feature allocation, and network analysis. A key quantity of interest is the Laplace exponent, whose asymptotic behavior determines how the random structures scale. When the Laplace exponent grows nearly linearly - known as rapid variation - the induced models exhibit approximately linear growth in the number of clusters, features, or edges with sample size or network nodes. This regime is especially relevant for modeling sparse networks, yet existing CRM constructions lack tractability under rapid variation. We address this by introducing a new class of CRMs with index of variation $α\in(0,1]$, defined as mixtures of stable or generalized gamma processes. These models offer interpretable parameters, include well-known CRMs as limiting cases, and retain analytical tractability through a tractable Laplace exponent and simple size-biased representation. We analyze the asymptotic properties of this CRM class and apply it to the Caron-Fox framework for sparse graphs. The resulting models produce networks with near-linear edge growth, aligning with empirical evidence from large-scale networks. Additionally, we present efficient algorithms for simulation and posterior inference, demonstrating practical advantages through experiments on real-world sparse network datasets."

2505.13193,Singularity of the spectrum of typical minimal smooth area-preserving flows in any genus,"['math.DS', 'math-ph']","['Krzysztof Frączek', 'Adam Kanigowski', 'Corinna Ulcigrai']","We consider smooth flows preserving a smooth invariant measure, or, equivalently, locally Hamiltonian flows on compact orientable surfaces and show that almost every such locally Hamiltonian flow with only simple saddles has singular spectrum. Furthermore, we prove that almost every pair of such flows is spectrally disjoint. More in general, singularity of the spectrum and pairwise disjointness holds for special flows over a full measure set of interval exchange transformations under a roof with symmetric logarithmic singularities. The spectral result is proved using a criterion for singularity based on tightness of Birkhoff sums with exponential tails decay and the cancellations proved by the last author to prove absence of mixing in this class of flows, by showing that the latter can be combined with rigidity. Disjointness of pairs then follows by producing mixing times (for the second flow), using a new mechanism for shearing based on resonant rigidity times."

Particularly, we define the forward noising process using Dirichlet forms associated to the Cameron-Martin space of Gaussian measures and Wiener chaoses; whereas by relying on an abstract time-reversal formula, we show that the score function is a Malliavin derivative and it corresponds to a conditional expectation. This allows us to generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the Fisher information of the data distribution. Lastly, we specify our discussion for spherical random fields, considering as source of noise a Whittle-Matérn random spherical field."

This model describes the energy-driven motion of a surface cluster whose distributional solution was studied by Garcke and Sturzenhecker. We approximate the weak formulation of this sharp interface model by an unfitted finite element method that uses parametric elements for the representation of the moving interfaces. We establish existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution and prove unconditional stability of the proposed scheme. Moreover, a modification of the original scheme leads to a structure-preserving variant, in that it conserves the discrete analogue of a quantity that is preserved by the classical solution. Some numerical results demonstrate the applicability of our introduced schemes."

After proving a stability estimate of this algorithm, we perform numerical simulations to verify the proposed method's effectiveness."

The original conjecture in the complex algebraic setting was recently disproved by Beheshti et al. However, we show that the statement holds when the complex structure is replaced by a generic almost complex structure. The proof relies on showing that the fixed-domain Gromov-Witten pseudocycle can be constructed without the use of inhomogeneous or domain-dependent perturbations, which answers positively a question posed by Ruan and Tian."

2505.13106,How to optimise tournament draws: The case of the FIFA World Cup,"['math.OC', 'physics.soc-ph', 'stat.AP']",['László Csató'],The organisers of major sports competitions use different policies with respect to constraints in the group draw. Our paper aims to rationalise these choices by analysing the trade-off between attractiveness (the number of games played by teams from the same geographic zone) and fairness (the departure of the draw mechanism from a uniform distribution). A parametric optimisation model is formulated and applied to the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup draws. A flaw of the draw procedure is identified: the pre-assignment of the host to a group unnecessarily increases the distortions. All Pareto efficient sets of draw constraints are determined via simulations. The proposed framework can be used to find the optimal draw rules and justify the non-uniformity of the draw procedure for the stakeholders.
2505.13105,Mode-Prefix-Based Control of Switched Linear Systems with Applications to Fault Tolerance,['math.OC'],"['Ram Padmanabhan', 'Antoine Aspeel', 'Necmiye Ozay', 'Melkior Ornik']","In this paper, we consider the problem of designing prefix-based optimal controllers for switched linear systems over finite horizons. This problem arises in fault-tolerant control, when system faults result in abrupt changes in dynamics. We consider a class of mode-prefix-based linear controllers that depend only on the history of the switching signal. The proposed optimal control problems seek to minimize both expected performance and worst-case performance over switching signals. We show that this problem can be reduced to a convex optimization problem. To this end, we synthesize one controller for each switching signal under a prefix constraint that ensures consistency between controllers. Then, system level synthesis is used to obtain a convex program in terms of the system-level parameters. In particular, it is shown that the prefix constraints are linear in terms of the system-level parameters. Finally, we apply this framework for optimal control of a fighter jet model suffering from system faults, illustrating how fault tolerance is ensured."

In this article, we are interested in using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) to solve the Stefan problem using a regularized total enthalpy model. The liquid fraction is treated as a nonlinear source/sink term, that involves the time derivative of the solution. The resulting non-linear system is solved using a Newton algorithm. By conserving the locality of the problem, this method is highly scalable, while keeping a high accuracy. The newly developed scheme is analyzed theoretically through a Chapman-Enskog expansion and illustrated numerically with 1D and 2D benchmarks."

Wotte', 'Arne Sachtler', 'Alin Albu-Schäffer', 'Stefano Stramigioli', 'Cosimo Della Santina']","Multi-body mechanical systems have rich internal dynamics, which can be exploited to formulate efficient control targets. For periodic regulation tasks in robotics applications, this motivated the extension of the theory on nonlinear normal modes to Riemannian manifolds, and led to the definition of Eigenmanifolds. This definition is geometric, which is advantageous for generality within robotics but also obscures the connection of Eigenmanifolds to a large body of results from the literature on nonlinear dynamics. We bridge this gap, showing that Eigenmanifolds are instances of Lyapunov subcenter manifolds (LSMs), and that their stronger geometric properties with respect to LSMs follow from a time-symmetry of conservative mechanical systems. This directly leads to local existence and uniqueness results for Eigenmanifolds. Furthermore, we show that an additional spatial symmetry provides Eigenmanifolds with yet stronger properties of Rosenberg manifolds, which can be favorable for control applications, and we present a sufficient condition for their existence and uniqueness. These theoretical results are numerically confirmed on two mechanical systems with a non-constant inertia tensor: a double pendulum and a 5-link pendulum."

In practice, these objects are studied by taking a finite sample and introducing periodic boundary conditions, however this introduces and removes many subtle homological features. Here, build on the work of Onus and Robins (2022) and Onus and Skraba (2023) to investigate whether one can recover the (persistent) homology of a periodic cell complex $K$ from a finite quotient space $G$ of equivalence classes under translations. In particular, we search for a computationally friendly method to identify all ''toroidal cycles'' of $G$ which do not lift to cycles in $K$. We show that all toroidal and non-toroidal cycles of $G$ of arbitrary homology degree can be completely classified for $K$ of arbitrary periodicity using the recently developed machinery of bisheaves and persistent local systems. In doing so, we also introduce a framework for a computationally viable persistence theory of periodic spaces.

Our approach is based on an iterative scheme that builds on the solution to the capillary Minkowski problem (i.e., the case $p = 1$) and leverages the monotonicity of a class of functionals under a family of capillary curvature image operators. These operators are constructed so that their fixed points, whenever they exist, correspond precisely to solutions of the capillary $L_p$-Minkowski problem."

A graph $G$ is called an $[s,t]$-graph if any induced subgraph of $G$ of order $s$ has size at least $t.$ We prove that every $k$-connected $[k+1,2]$-graph is hamiltonian-connected except $kK_1\vee G_{k},$ where $k\ge 2$ and $G_{k}$ is an arbitrary graph of order $k.$ This generalizes the Chvátal-Erdős theorem."

We establish their equivalence up to multiplicative constants and provide examples clarifying when the change of constants is necessary. We also give exact results on preservation of the quantitative Schur property by finite or infinite direct sums. We further prove a sufficient condition for the $1$-Schur property which simplifies and generalizes previous results.
  We study in more detail relationship of the quantitative Schur property to quantitative weak sequential completeness and to equivalence of measures of weak non-compactness. We also illustrate the difference of real and complex settings. To this end we prove and use the optimal version of complex quantiative Rosenthal $\ell_1$-theorem. Finally, we give two examples of Lipschitz-free spaces over countable graphs which have quantitative Schur property, but not the $1$-Schur property."

First, by establishing the uniform moment boundedness and finite-time strong convergence of the BEM method, we prove that for sufficiently small step sizes, the numerical approximations strongly converge to the underlying solution in the infinite horizon with a rate of $1/2$, which coincides with the optimal finite-time strong convergence rate.
  Next, we establish the uniform boundedness and convergence in probability for the segment processes associated with the BEM method. This analysis further demonstrates that the probability measures of the numerical segment processes converge to the underlying invariant measure of the SDDEs. Finally, a numerical example and simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results."
2505.12877,Exceptional extensions of local fields and the Carlitz--Wan conjecture,['math.NT'],"['Zhiguo Ding', 'Wei Xiong', 'Qifan Zhang']","For any prime power $q$, a polynomial $f(X)\in\F_q[X]$ is ``exceptional'' if it induces bijections of $\F_{q^k}$ for infinitely many $k$; this condition is known to be equivalent to $f(X)$ inducing a bijection of $\F_{q^k}$ for at least one $k$ with $q^k\ge °(f)^4$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of an ``exceptional'' extension of local fields of any characteristic, and show that if $f(X)\in\F_q[X]$ is exceptional in the classical sense then the field extension $\F_q(X)/\F_q(f(X))$ yields an exceptional local field extension upon passing to the completion at a degree-$1$ place. We describe all exceptional local field extensions of degree coprime to the residue characteristic, determine the relationship between exceptionality of a local field extension and exceptionality of a subextension, and give various Galois-theoretic characterizations of exceptional local field extensions. As a consequence, we obtain three new proofs, using quite different tools, of a theorem of Guralnick and Müller about ramification indices in exceptional maps between curves over $\F_q$. This theorem generalizes a result of Lenstra which subsumes earlier conjectures of Carlitz and Wan."

Dallard et al. showed that bounded tree-independence number is sufficient for $(tw,ω)$-boundedness, and conjectured that the converse holds. While this conjecture has been recently disproved, it is still interesting to determine classes where the conjecture holds; for example, the conjecture is still open for graph classes excluding an induced star, as well as for finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs. In this paper, we identify further families of graph classes where $(tw,ω)$-boundedness is equivalent to bounded tree-independence number. We settle a number of cases of finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, obtain several equivalent characterizations of $(tw, ω)$-boundedness in subclasses of the class of complements of line graphs, and give a short proof of a recent result of Ahn, Gollin, Huynh, and Kwon [SODA 2025] establishing bounded tree-independence number for graphs excluding a fixed induced star and a fixed number of independent cycles."

In this paper, we investigate conditions under which there exists an element $a \in D$ such that the subfield $F(a)$ generated by $a$ is a maximal subfield of $D$. Specifically, we prove that there always exists an element $a$ in the set \[ \{f(a_1,\dots,a_m)\mid a_1,\dots, a_m\in D \} \cup \{w(a_1,\dots,a_m)\mid a_1,\dots, a_m\in D \backslash \{0\} \} \] such that $F(a)$ is a maximal subfield of $D$.

We combine the operator theory and the inward/outward energy theory to deduce a modified wave operator for repulsive potentials decaying like $|x|^{-β}$ with $β>1/3$. In particular the regular wave operator without modification exists if $β>1$. This implies that the asymptotic behaviour of finite-energy solutions to the wave equation $u_{tt} - Δu + |x|^{-β} u =0$ is similar to that of the solutions to the classic wave equation if $β\in (1,2)$."
2505.12829,Algebro-combinatorial generalizations of the Victoir method for constructing weighted designs,['math.CO'],"['Hiroshi Nozaki', 'Masanori Sawa']","A weighted $t$-design in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a finite weighted set that exactly integrates all polynomials of degree at most $t$ with respect to a given probability measure. A fundamental problem is to construct weighted $t$-designs with as few points as possible. Victoir (2004) proposed a method to reduce the size of weighted $t$-designs while preserving the $t$-design property by using combinatorial objects such as combinatorial designs or orthogonal arrays with two levels. In this paper, we give an algebro-combinatorial generalization of both Victoir's method and its variant by the present authors (2014) in the framework of Euclidean polynomial spaces, enabling us to reduce the size of weighted designs obtained from the classical product rule. Our generalization allows the use of orthogonal arrays with arbitrary levels, whereas Victoir only treated the case of two levels. As an application, we present a construction of equi-weighted $5$-designs with $O(d^4)$ points for product measures such as Gaussian measure $π^{-d/2} e^{-\sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2} dx_1 \cdots dx_d$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ or equilibrium measure $π^{-d} \prod_{i=1}^d (1-x_i^2)^{-1/2} dx_1 \cdots dx_d$ on $(-1,1)^d$, where $d$ is any integer at least 5. The construction is explicit and does not rely on numerical approximations. Moreover, we establish an existence theorem of Gaussian $t$-designs with $N$ points for any $t \geq 2$, where $N< q^{t}d^{t-1}=O(d^{t-1})$ for fixed sufficiently large prime power $q$. As a corollary of this result, we give an improvement of a famous theorem by Milman (1988) on isometric embeddings of the classical finite-dimensional Banach spaces."

Clearly, $λ=0$ for bipartite graphs; ergo, we define $λ$-matchable pairs analogously, and we let $ρ(G)$ denote the number of such pairs.
  We improve the constant lower bounds on both $λ$ and $ρ$ established recently by Chen, Lu and Zhang [Discrete Math., 2025] using matching-theoretic parameters arising from the seminal work of Lovász [J.

These have recently drawn renewed attention. In particular, Amdeberhan, Andrews, and Tauraso extended the first family above by defining $$ U_t(a,q):=\sum_{1\leq n_1<n_2<\cdots<n_t}\prod_{k=1}^t\frac{q^{n_k}}{1+aq^{n_k}+q^{2n_k}} $$ for $a=0, \pm1, \pm2$ and investigated various properties, including some congruences satisfied by the coefficients of the power series representations for $U_t(a,q)$. These arithmetic aspects were subsequently expanded upon by the authors of the present work. Our goal here is to generalize the second family of generating functions, where the sums run over odd integers, and then apply similar techniques to show new infinite families of Ramanujan--like congruences for the associated power series coefficients."

Concurrent systems represent state models where the state is distributed and where state changes are local. Starting from a spectral property on the combinatorics of concurrent systems, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a Markov measure on the space of infinite trajectories relatively to any weight distributions. In turn, we obtain a combinatorial result by proving that the kernel of the associated Möbius matrix has dimension 1; the Möbius matrix extends in this context the Möbius polynomial of a trace monoid. We study ergodic properties of irreducible concurrent systems and we prove a Strong law of large numbers. It allows us to introduce the speedup as a measurement of the average amount of concurrency within infinite trajectories. Examples are studied."

In particular, we study stochastic control problems in the ``decision-hazard-decision'' form where at each stage, the system state is controlled both by predictable as well as adapted controls. Such an information structure may result in a lower dimensional system state than what is required in more traditional ``decision-hazard'' or ``hazard-decision'' formulations. The dimension is critical for the complexity of numerical dynamic programming algorithms and, in particular, for cutting plane schemes such as the stochastic dual dynamic programming algorithm. Our main result characterizes optimal solutions and optimum values in terms of solutions to generalized Bellman equations. Existence of solutions to the Bellman equations is established under general conditions that do not require compactness. We allow for general randomness but show that, in the Markovian case, the dimensionality of the Bellman equations reduces with respect to randomness just like in more traditional control formulations."

2505.12779,Determining $t$-motives and dual $t$-motives in Anderson's theory,"['math.NT', 'math.RA']",['Andreas Maurischat'],"Anderson t-modules are analogs of abelian varieties in positive characteristic. Associated to such a t-module, there are its t-motive and its dual t-motive. When dealing with these objects, several questions occur which one would like to solve algorithmically. For example, for a given t-module one would like to decide whether its t-motive is indeed finitely generated free, and determine a basis. Reversely, for a given object in the category of t-motives one would like to decide whether it is the t-motive associated to a t-module, and determine that t-module.
  In this article, we positively answer such questions by providing the corresponding algorithms.
  As it turned out, the main part of all these algorithms stem from a single algorithm in non-commutative algebra, and hence the first part of this article doesn't deal with Anderson's objects at all, but are results on finitely generated modules over skew polynomial rings."
2505.12777,Wonderful embedding for group schemes in the Bruhat--Tits theory,['math.AG'],['Shang Li'],"For a reductive group $G$ over a discretely valued Henselian field $k$, using valuations of root datum and concave functions, the Bruhat--Tits theory defines an important class of open bounded subgroups of $G(k)$ which are essential objects in representation theory and arithmetic geometry. Moreover, these subgroups are uniquely determined by smooth affine group schemes whose generic fibers are $G$ over the ring of integers of $k$. To study these group schemes, when $G$ is adjoint and quasi-split, we systematically construct wonderful embedding for these group schemes which are uniquely determined by a big cell structure. The way that we construct our wonderful embedding is different from classical methods in the sense that we avoid embedding a group scheme into an ambient space and taking closure. We use an intrinsic and functorial method which is a variant of Artin--Weil method of birational group laws. Beyond the quasi-split case, our wonderful embedding is constructed by étale descent. Moreover our wonderful embedding behaves in a similar way to the classical wonderful compactification of $G$. Our results can serve as a bridge between the theory of wonderful compactifications and the Bruhat--Tits theory."

We transform the problem into Wang tiling enumeration within an $(m+1) \times (n+1)$ rectangle and compute the results for all cases where $m + n \leq 79$ using tensor network contraction algorithm, and provided an approximation for larger $m, n$.
  Using the same algorithm, we also enumerated independent sets with vertex number restrictions. Based on the results, we analyzed the vertex number that maximize the enumeration for each pair $(m, n)$. Additionally, we compute the corresponding weighted enumeration, where each independent set is weighted by the number of its vertices (i.e., the total sum of vertices over all independent sets). The approximations for larger $m, n$ are given as well.
  Our results have added thousands of new items to the OEIS sequences A089980 and A193580. In addition, the combinatorial problems above are closely related to the hard-core model in physics. We estimate some important constants based on the existing results, and the relative error between our estimation of the entropy constant and the existing results is less than $10^{-9}$."

Intuitively, this compactification provides information at infinity. The diagonal action also extends the conjugation action on semisimple groups, which has received considerable attention. In this work, we will first describe the classification of certain diagonal orbits in the wonderful compactification of a semisimple adjoint group $ G $. We will then study the compactification of the maximal torus through representations of the simply connected cover $ \tilde{G} $, which, in a sense, parameterizes these diagonal orbits. Finally, we will focus on constructing the family of closures of the Steinberg fiber. We will examine the limit of this family and show that it is a union of He-Lusztig's $ G $-stable pieces."

A key property of many tensor decompositions, such as the canonical polyadic decomposition, is identifiability: the factors are unique, up to trivial scaling and permutation ambiguities. This allows one to recover the groundtruth sources that generated the data. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a central and widely used tensor decomposition model. However, it is in general not identifiable. In this paper, we study the identifiability of the nonnegative TD (nTD). By adapting and extending identifiability results of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), we provide uniqueness results for nTD. Our results require the nonnegative matrix factors to have some degree of sparsity (namely, satisfy the separability condition, or the sufficiently scattered condition), while the core tensor only needs to have some slices (or linear combinations of them) or unfoldings with full column rank (but does not need to be nonnegative). Under such conditions, we derive several procedures, using either unfoldings or slices of the input tensor, to obtain identifiable nTDs by minimizing the volume of unfoldings or slices of the core tensor."

To examine whether a specified parametric model is correct or not, we also construct the quasi-likelihood ratio test statistics and investigate the asymptotic properties.

Moving away from traditional graph-based and algebraic methods, a simple and fast algorithm is proposed to list complementary set partitions based on two-block partitions, making the computation more accessible and implementable also in non-symbolic programming languages like R. Computational comparisons in Maple demonstrate the efficiency of the proposal. Additionally the notion of generalized cumulant is extended using multiset subdivisions and multi-index partitions to include scenarios with repeated variables and to address more sophisticated dependence structures. A formula is provided that expresses generalized multivariate cumulants as linear combinations of multivariate cumulants, weighted by coefficients that admit a natural combinatorial interpretation. Finally, the introduction of dummy variables and specialized multi-index partitions enables an efficient procedure for estimating generalized multivariate cumulants with a substantial reduction in data power sums involved."

2505.12687,A partial result towards the Chowla--Milnor conjecture,['math.NT'],"['Li Lai', 'Jia Li']","The Chowla--Milnor conjecture predicts the linear independence of certain Hurwitz zeta values. In this paper, we prove that for any fixed integer $k \geqslant 2$, the dimension of the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear span of $ζ(k,a/q)-(-1)^{k}ζ(k,1-a/q)$ ($1 \leqslant a < q/2$, $\gcd(a,q)=1$) is at least $(c_k -o(1)) \cdot \log q$ as the positive integer $q \to +\infty$ for some constant $c_k>0$ depending only on $k$. It is well known that $ζ(k,a/q)+(-1)^{k}ζ(k,1-a/q) \in \overline{\mathbb{Q}}π^k$, but much less is known previously for $ζ(k,a/q)-(-1)^{k}ζ(k,1-a/q)$. Our proof is similar to those of Ball--Rivoal (2001) and Zudilin (2002) concerning the linear independence of Riemann zeta values. However, we use a new type of rational functions to construct linear forms."

This provides a simpler and more direct proof of the Gaussian estimates when the coefficients have Dini mean oscillation in $x$, avoiding the use of normalized adjoint solutions required in previous works."

The evolution of the discrete states probability distribution governed by MH can be interpreted as a gradient descent direction of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, via a mobility function and a score function. Specifically, this gradient is defined on a probability simplex equipped with a discrete Wasserstein-2 metric with a mobility function. This motivates us to study a momentum-based acceleration framework using damped Hamiltonian flows on the simplex set, whose stationary distribution matches the discrete target distribution. Furthermore, we design an interacting particle system to approximate the proposed accelerated sampling dynamics. The extension of the algorithm with a general choice of potentials and mobilities is also discussed. In particular, we choose the accelerated gradient flow of the relative Fisher information, demonstrating the advantages of the algorithm in estimating discrete score functions without requiring the normalizing constant and keeping positive probabilities. Numerical examples, including sampling on a Gaussian mixture supported on lattices or a distribution on a hypercube, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed discrete-state sampling algorithm."

We establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution by the Galerkin method in evolving Bochner spaces and a monotonicity argument. The main difficulty is in characterizing the weak limit of the nonlinear gradient term, where we need to deal with a term which comes from the boundary condition and cannot be absorbed into a monotone operator. To overcome this difficulty, we prove a uniform-in-time Friedrichs type inequality on a moving domain with time-dependent basis functions and make use of it to get the strong convergence of approximate solutions. We also show that the time derivative exists in the $L^2$ sense when given data have a better regularity."

For a proper three-parameter unfolding that splits the tangency, varies the argument of the stable multipliers, and controls the modulus $|λγ|$, we show that a Hopf bifurcation occurs on this curve and that a homoclinic point to the bifurcating periodic orbit is present.

We show that by randomizing the integration time in HF-opt, the resulting randomized Hamiltonian flow (RHF) achieves accelerated convergence rates in continuous time, similar to the rates for the accelerated gradient flow. We study a discrete-time implementation of RHF as the randomized Hamiltonian gradient descent (RHGD) algorithm. We prove that RHGD achieves the same accelerated convergence rates as Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (AGD) for minimizing smooth strongly and weakly convex functions.

We consider smooth Hamiltonians with an at most quadratic growth, and also a class of nonsmooth Hamiltonians, encompassing potentials that are Fourier transforms of complex (finite) Borel measures. Roughly speaking, if the initial datum belongs to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, for $p$ in a suitable range of exponents, the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ (for each fixed $t$, with the exception of certain particular values) can be meaningfully restricted to compact curved submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The underlying property responsible for this phenomenon is the boundedness of the propagator $L^p\to(\mathcal{F}L^p)_{\rm loc}$, with $1\leq p\leq2$, which is derived from almost diagonalization and dispersive estimates in function spaces defined in terms of wave packet decompositions in phase space."

In this work, we resolves a long-standing problem -- how to establish the stability of multi-product expansion (MPE) splitting methods with negative weights. The difficulty occurs because negative weights in high-order MPE method cause the sum of the absolute values of weights larger than one, making standard stability proofs fail. In particular, we take the semilinear parabolic equation as a typical model and establish the stability of arbitrarily high-order MPE splitting methods with positive time steps but possibly negative weights. Rigorous convergence analysis is subsequently obtained from the stability result. Extensive numerical experiments validate the stability and accuracy of various high-order MPE splitting methods, highlighting their efficiency and robustness."

We also prove that under the slow volume regular condition, the conjunction of the Poincaré inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the resistance estimate. As a direct corollary, on a large family of fractals and metric measure spaces, including the Sierpiński gasket and the Sierpiński carpet, we obtain the singularity of the $p$-energy measure with respect to the underlying measure for all $p$ strictly great than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension."

We prove that the unique optimal control can be represented as a feedback control via a Riccati operator which solves a suitable version of the Riccati equation. Both the feedback operator and the Riccati equation acts on such time dependent space. The derivation of these main results requires a very precise analysis of the properties of the derivatives of the value function and we find an explicit form for the derivative of the Riccati operator."

The discrete optimization in our method is based on low-rank tensor techniques, which, thanks to their low-parameter representation, enable efficient optimization of high-dimensional problems. For the second part, i.e., local search, any effective gradient-based method can be used, whether existing (such as quasi-Newton methods) or any other developed in the future. Our approach addresses the limitations of gradient-based methods, such as getting stuck in local optima; the limitations of discrete methods, which cannot be directly applied to continuous functions; and limitations of gradient-free methods that require large computational budgets. Note that we are not limited to a single type of low-rank tensor decomposition for discrete optimization, but for illustrative purposes, we consider a specific efficient low-rank tensor train decomposition. For 20 challenging 100-dimensional functions, we demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform results obtained with gradient-based methods like Conjugate Gradient, BFGS, SLSQP, and other methods, improving them by orders of magnitude with the same computing budget."
2505.12378,Efficient Optimization with Orthogonality Constraint: a Randomized Riemannian Submanifold Method,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']","['Andi Han', 'Pierre-Louis Poirion', 'Akiko Takeda']","Optimization with orthogonality constraints frequently arises in various fields such as machine learning. Riemannian optimization offers a powerful framework for solving these problems by equipping the constraint set with a Riemannian manifold structure and performing optimization intrinsically on the manifold. This approach typically involves computing a search direction in the tangent space and updating variables via a retraction operation. However, as the size of the variables increases, the computational cost of the retraction can become prohibitively high, limiting the applicability of Riemannian optimization to large-scale problems. To address this challenge and enhance scalability, we propose a novel approach that restricts each update on a random submanifold, thereby significantly reducing the per-iteration complexity. We introduce two sampling strategies for selecting the random submanifolds and theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed methods. We provide convergence results for general nonconvex functions and functions that satisfy Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition as well as for stochastic optimization settings. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to quotient manifolds derived from the orthogonal manifold. Extensive experiments verify the benefits of the proposed method, across a wide variety of problems."

He proved that this map is an isomorphism and that it is covariant with respect to proper maps. Moreover G. Vezzosi and A. Vistoli proved a decomposition theorem for the equivariant K-theory of a noetherian scheme. In this paper we give a geometric definition of the Vezzosi-Vistoli decomposition, interpreting the pieces as corresponding to the components of the cyclotomic inertia. When the map from the cyclotomic inertia to the stack is finite, we can define a Riemann-Roch map in Toen's style. We prove that this map is an isomorphism and it is covariant with respect to proper relatively tame maps; moreover in some favourable circumstances we explicitly compute its inverse map, and show that we can recover Toen's one when the stack is tame Deligne-Mumford."

Vezzosi and A. Vistoli defined the geometric part of the rational equivariant K-theory $K(X,G)$ and conjectured that it is isomorphic to the rational K-theory of the quotient $X/G$. In this paper we refine the construction of geometric K-theory to the rational K-theory of a quotient stack $[X/G]$ over an arbitrary excellent base; we show that it is part of an intrinsic decomposition of the K-theory of the stack and prove many properties that make it amenable to computations."

2505.12352,Backward bifurcations and multistationarity,['math.DS'],"['Alexis Nangue', 'Alan D. Rendall']","The theory of backward bifurcations provides a criterion for the existence of positive steady states in epidemiological models with parameters where the basic reproductive ratio is less than one. It is often seen in simulations that this phenomenon is accompanied by multistationarity, i.e. the existence of more than one positive steady state, but the latter circumstance is not implied by the general theory. The central result of this paper is a theorem which gives a criterion for the existence of one stable and one unstable positive steady state for parameters where the basic reproductive ratio is less than one. It also gives a criterion for the existence of one stable and one unstable positive steady state in the case that the basic reproductive ratio is greater than one. These steady states arise in a bifurcation. It is shown that in one case, a model for the in-host dynamics of hepatitis C, this result can be used as a basis for showing the existence of parameters for which there are two positive steady states, one of which is stable. Thus, in particular, multistationarity is proved in that case. It is also shown to what extent this theorem can be applied to some other models which have been studied in the literature and what new results can be obtained. In that context the new approach is compared with those previously known."
2505.12351,Iwasawa theory for vertex-weighted graphs,"['math.CO', 'math.NT']","['Ryosuke Murooka', 'Sohei Tateno']","Chung-Langlands established a matrix-tree theorem for positive-real valued vertex-weighted graphs, and Wu-Feng-Sato developed a theory of Ihara zeta functions for those graphs. In this paper, generalizing and refining these previous works, we initiate the Iwasawa theory for vertex-weighted graphs, which is a generalization of the Iwasawa theory for graphs initiated by Gonet and Vallières independently. First, we generalize the matrix-tree theorem by Chung-Langlands to arbitrary field-valued vertex-weighted graphs. Second, we refine and prove the so-called decomposition formula for vertex-weighted graphs and edge-weighted graphs without any assumption. Applying these results, we prove the Iwasawa-type formula and Kida's formula for $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-towers of vertex-weighted graphs. Our refinement of the decomposition formulas allows us to estimate the root-wise growth of weighted complexities in $\mathbb{Z}_p^d$-towers. We also provide several numerical examples."

The objective is to minimize the expected cost until production stops when inventory reaches a specified level, subject to a boundary condition. Using probability space and Brownian motion, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived, and optimal feedback control is obtained. The solution demonstrates desirable monotonicity and convexity properties under specific assumptions. An illustrative example further confirms these results with explicit function properties and a practical application."

  where $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\{Y_{i,j}\}_{1\le i<j\le n}$ are independent sequences of i.i.d. random variables. Our approach relies on moment identities and cumulant bounds that are derived using partition diagram arguments. Normal approximation bounds in the Kolmogorov distance and moderate deviation results are then obtained by the cumulant method. Those results are applied to subgraph counting in the binomial random-connection model, which is a generalization of the Erdős-Rényi model."

A problem posed by Katona and Makar-Limanov is to determine whether the minimum and maximum sizes of the families $\mathcal{F}_a(h)$ (as $a$ ranges over $G$) become asymptotically equal as $n\rightarrow \infty$ when $h=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor$. We affirmatively answer this question and in fact show that the same asymptotic equality holds for every $4\leq h\leq \left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor+1$."
2505.12314,A smoothing moving balls approximation method for a class of conic-constrained difference-of-convex optimization problems,['math.OC'],"['Jiefeng Xu', 'Ting Kei Pong', 'Nung-sing Sze']","In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing a difference-of-convex objective over a nonlinear conic constraint, where the cone is closed, convex, pointed and has a nonempty interior. We assume that the support function of a compact base of the polar cone exhibits a majorizing smoothing approximation, a condition that is satisfied by widely studied cones such as $\mathbb{R}^m_-$ and ${\cal S}^m_-$. Leveraging this condition, we reformulate the conic constraint equivalently as a single constraint involving the aforementioned support function, and adapt the moving balls approximation (MBA) method for its solution. In essence, in each iteration of our algorithm, we approximate the support function by a smooth approximation function and apply one MBA step. The subproblems that arise in our algorithm always involve only one single inequality constraint, and can thus be solved efficiently via one-dimensional root-finding procedures. We design explicit rules to evolve the smooth approximation functions from iteration to iteration and establish the corresponding iteration complexity for obtaining an $ε$-Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. In addition, in the convex setting, we establish convergence of the sequence generated, and study its local convergence rate under a standard Hölderian growth condition. Finally, we illustrate numerically the effects of different rules of evolving the smooth approximation functions on the rate of convergence."

Both asymptotic stability and finite-time stability for the ladder system is rigorously established by applying Lyapunov stability theory and finite-time stability criteria. We also derive an upper bound of the time required for convergence to an eigenstate of the intrinsic Hamiltonian. Numerical simulations on a rubidium ladder three-level atomic system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

2505.12289,BOLT: Block-Orthonormal Lanczos for Trace estimation of matrix functions,"['math.NA', 'cs.DS', 'cs.LG']","['Kingsley Yeon', 'Promit Ghosal', 'Mihai Anitescu']","Efficient matrix trace estimation is essential for scalable computation of log-determinants, matrix norms, and distributional divergences. In many large-scale applications, the matrices involved are too large to store or access in full, making even a single matrix-vector (mat-vec) product infeasible. Instead, one often has access only to small subblocks of the matrix or localized matrix-vector products on restricted index sets. Hutch++ achieves optimal convergence rate but relies on randomized SVD and assumes full mat-vec access, making it difficult to apply in these constrained settings. We propose the Block-Orthonormal Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (BOLT), which matches Hutch++ accuracy with a simpler implementation based on orthonormal block probes and Lanczos iterations. BOLT builds on the Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (SLQ) framework, which combines random probing with Krylov subspace methods to efficiently approximate traces of matrix functions, and performs better than Hutch++ in near flat-spectrum regimes. To address memory limitations and partial access constraints, we introduce Subblock SLQ, a variant of BOLT that operates only on small principal submatrices. As a result, this framework yields a proxy KL divergence estimator and an efficient method for computing the Wasserstein-2 distance between Gaussians - both compatible with low-memory and partial-access regimes. We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate strong empirical performance across a range of high-dimensional settings."
2505.12282,Kernel Interpolation on Sparse Grids,['math.NA'],"['Michael Griebel', 'Helmut Harbrecht', 'Michael Multerer']","We consider scattered data approximation on product regions of equal and different dimensionality. On each of these regions, we assume quasi-uniform but unstructured data sites and construct optimal sparse grids for scattered data interpolation on the product region. For this, we derive new improved error estimates for the respective kernel interpolation error by invoking duality arguments. An efficient algorithm to solve the underlying linear system of equations is proposed. The algorithm is based on the sparse grid combination technique, where a sparse direct solver is used for the elementary anisotropic tensor product kernel interpolation problems. The application of the sparse direct solver is facilitated by applying a samplet matrix compression to each univariate kernel matrix, resulting in an essentially sparse representation of the latter. In this way, we obtain a method that is able to deal with large problems up to billions of interpolation points, especially in case of reproducing kernels of nonlocal nature. Numerical results are presented to qualify and quantify the approach."

Given the probability of the intersection of each collection of up to $k+1$ of these events, what can we say about the probability that at least $r$ of the events occur? This question dates back to Boole in the 19th century, and it is well known that the odd partial sums of the Inclusion- Exclusion formula provide upper bounds, while the even partial sums provide lower bounds. We give a combinatorial characterization of the error in these bounds and use it to derive a very simple proof of the strongest possible bounds of a certain form, as well as a couple of improved bounds. The new bounds use more information than the classical Bonferroni-type inequalities, and are often sharper."

Assume the initial helical vorticity is sharply concentrated in $N$ distinct $\ep$-neighborhoods, whose mutual distances vanish as $O(1/|\ln \ep|)$, and each vortex core possesses vorticity mass of order $1/|\ln \ep|^{1+b}$ for an arbitrary fixed $b\in\mathbb R$. We prove that as $\ep\to 0$, the motion of these helical vortices converges uniformly to a dynamical system derived herein over a time interval of order $1/|\ln\varepsilon|^{1-b}$. In the particular case $b=-1$, our results establish the evolution counterpart for interacting vortex helices constructed in [I. Guerra, M. Musso, Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré C Anal. Non Lináire, 2025]. Notably, for two interacting helical vortices with initial mutual distance $ ρ_0/|\ln \ep|$, by choosing $ρ_0$ sufficiently small, our analysis extends to timescales covering multiple periods. This result provides the first mathematical justification for the numerically observed phenomenon termed ``leapfrogging of Kelvin waves"" reported in [N. Hietala et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, 2016]."

2505.12227,An Explicit Description of Extreme Points of the Set of Couplings with Given Marginals: with Application to Minimum-Entropy Coupling Problems,['math.PR'],"['Ya-Jing Ma', 'Feng Wang', 'Xian-Yuan Wu', 'Kai-Yuan Cai']","Given probability distributions ${\bf p}=(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_m)$ and ${\bf q}=(q_1,q_2,\ldots, q_n)$ with $m,n\geq 2$, denote by ${\cal C}(\bf p,q)$ the set of all couplings of $\bf p,q$, a convex subset of $\R^{mn}$. Denote by ${\cal C}_e({\bf p},{\bf q})$ the finite set of all extreme points of ${\cal C}(\bf p,q)$. It is well known that, as a strictly concave function, the Shannan entropy $H$ on ${\cal C}(\bf p,q)$ takes its minimal value in ${\cal C}_e({\bf p},{\bf q})$. In this paper, first, the detailed structure of ${\cal C}_e({\bf p},{\bf q})$ is well specified and all extreme points are enumerated by a special algorithm. As an application, the exact solution of the minimum-entropy coupling problem is obtained. Second, it is proved that for any strict Schur-concave function $Ψ$ on ${\cal C}(\bf p,q)$, $Ψ$ also takes its minimal value on ${\cal C}_e({\bf p},{\bf q})$. As an application, the exact solution of the minimum-entropy coupling problem is obtained for $(Φ,\hbar)$-entropy, a large class of entropy including Shannon entropy, Rényi entropy and Tsallis entropy etc. Finally, all the above are generalized to multi-marginal case."
2505.12223,Enhanced Error-free Retrieval in Kuramoto-type Associative-memory Networks via Two-memory Configuration,['math.DS'],"['Zhuchun Li', 'Xiaoxue Zhao', 'Xiang Zhou']","We study the associative-memory network of Kuramoto-type oscillators that stores a set of memorized patterns (memories). In [Phys. Rev. Lett., 92 (2004), 108101], Nishikawa, Lai and Hoppensteadt showed that the capacity of this system for pattern retrieval with small errors can be made as high as that of the Hopfield network. Some stability analysis efforts focus on mutually orthogonal memories; however, the theoretical results do not ensure error-free retrieval in general situations. In this paper, we present a route for using the model in pattern retrieval problems with small or large errors. We employ the eigenspectrum analysis of Jacobians and potential analysis of the gradient flow to derive the stability/instability of binary patterns. For two memories, the eigenspectrum of Jacobian at each pattern can be specified, which enables us to give the critical value of the parameter to distinguish the memories from all other patterns in stability. This setting of two memories substantially reduces the number of stable patterns and enlarges their basins, allowing us to recover defective patterns. We extend this approach to general cases and present a deterministic method for ensuring error-free retrieval across a general set of standard patterns. Numerical simulations and comparative analyses illustrate the approach."

Leveraging the $L^1$-stability of monotone, longitude-independent profiles, we demonstrate that certain ill-prepared initial data within the vortex cap class exhibit an instability characterized by the growth of the interface perimeter. These configurations are nearly equivalent in area to a zonal vortex cap but are perturbed by a localized latitudinal bump. By comparing the longitudinal flows at points along the zonal interface and within the bump region, we track the induced stretching and capture the underlying instability mechanism."
2505.12195,Structural stability of supersonic spiral flows with large angular velocity for the Euler-Poisson system,['math.AP'],"['Chunpeng Wang', 'Zihao Zhang']","This paper concerns the structural stability of smooth cylindrically symmetric supersonic spiral flows with large angular velocity for the steady Euler-Poisson system in a concentric cylinder. We establish the existence and uniqueness of some smooth supersonic Euler-Poisson flows with nonzero angular velocity and vorticity including both cylindrical spiral flows and axisymmetric spiral flows. The deformation-curl-Poisson decomposition for the steady Euler-Poisson system is utilized to deal with the hyperbolic-elliptic mixed structure in the supersonic region. For smooth cylindrical supersonic spiral flows, the key point lies on the well-posedness of a boundary value problem for a linear second order hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system, which is achieved by finding an appropriate multiplier to obtain the important basic energy estimates. The nonlinear structural stability is established by designing a two-layer iteration and combining the estimates for the hyperbolic-elliptic system and the transport equations. For smooth axisymmetric supersonic spiral flows, we use the special structure of the steady Euler-Poisson system to derive a priori estimates of the linearized second order elliptic system, which enable us to establish the structural stability of the background supersonic flow within the class of axisymmetric flows."

The lifting operation, which naturally results in hypocoercive processes, can be formally interpreted as, though not restricted to, the reverse of the overdamped limit. We prove that the $L^2$ convergence rate of the lifted process is bounded above by the square root of the spectral gap of its overdamped dynamics, indicating that the lifting approach can at most achieve a transition from diffusive to ballistic mixing speeds. Further, using the variational hypocoercivity framework based on space-time Poincare inequalities, we derive a lower bound for the convergence rate of the lifted dynamics. These findings not only offer quantitative convergence guarantees for hypocoercive quantum Markov processes but also characterize the potential and limitations of accelerating the convergence through lifting. In addition, we develop an abstract lifting framework in the Hilbert space setting applicable to any symmetric contraction $C_0$-semigroup, thereby unifying the treatment of classical and quantum dynamics. As applications, we construct optimal lifts for various detailed balanced classical and quantum processes, including the symmetric random walk on a chain, the depolarizing semigroup, Schur multipliers, and quantum Markov semigroups on group von Neumann algebras."

We then apply the abstract result to establish the existence of martingale solutions of the fractional stochastic reaction-diffusion equation with polynomial drift driven by a superlinear noise.

We find a necessary and sufficient condition for systems of equiangular lines over finite fields to be equiangular tight frames (ETFs). As is the case over subfields of $\mathbb{C}$, it is necessary for the Welch bound to be saturated, but there is an additional condition required involving sums of triple products. We also prove that similar to the case over $\mathbb{C}$, collections of vectors are similar to a regular simplex essentially when the triple products of their scalar products satisfy a certain property. Finally, we investigate switching equivalence classes of frames and systems of lines focusing on systems of equiangular lines in finite orthogonal geometries with maximal incoherent sets, drawing connections to combinatorial design theory."

Our main result states that if $R$ is an $F$-finite $\QQ$-Gorenstein Cohen-Macaulay local ring of prime characteristics $p>0$, the Frobenius splitting numbers $a^Δ_e(R)$ remain unchanged under a suitable small perturbation. Moreover, we establish a desirable inequality of Frobenius splitting dimensions under general perturbations.

2505.12173,Dynamic homeostasis in relaxation and bursting oscillations,['math.DS'],"['Christopher J. Ryzowicz', 'Richard Bertram', 'Bhargav R. Karamched']","Homeostasis, broadly speaking, refers to the maintenance of a stable internal state when faced with external stimuli. Failure to manage these regulatory processes can lead to different diseases or death. Most physiologists and cell biologists around the world agree that homeostasis is a fundamental tenet of their disciplines. Nevertheless, a precise definition of homeostasis is hard to come by. Often times, homeostasis is simply defined as ``you know it when you see it''. Mathematical treatments of homeostasis involve studying equilibria of dynamical systems that are relatively invariant with respect to parameters. However, physiological processes are rarely static and often involve dynamic processes such as oscillations. In such dynamic environments, quantities such as average values may be relatively invariant with respect to parameters. This has been referred to as ``homeodynamics''. We present a general framework for homeodynamics involving systems with two or more time scales that elicits homeostasis in the temporal average of a species. The key point is that homeostasis manifests when measuring the slow variable responsible for driving oscillations and is not apparent in the fast variables. We demonstrate this in the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model for relaxation oscillations and then in two models for electrical bursting activity and calcium oscillations in pancreatic $β$-cells. One of these models has multiple slow variables, each driving the bursting oscillations in different parameter regimes, but homeodynamics is only present in the variable currently engaged in this role."

Comput. Phys. 400 (2020) 108877] is not only an efficient algorithm for simulation of classical $N$-particle systems and their mean-field limit, but also a new model for interacting particle system that could be more physical in some applications. In this work, we establish the propagation of chaos for the random batch particle system and at the same time obtain its sharp approximation error to the classical mean field limit of $N$-particle systems. The proof leverages the BBGKY hierarchy and achieves a sharp bound both in the particle number $N$ and the time step $τ$. In particular, by introducing a coupling of the division of the random batches to resolve the $N$-dependence, we derive an $\mathcal{O}(k^2/N^2 + kτ^2)$ bound on the $k$-particle relative entropy between the law of the system and the tensorized law of the mean-field limit. This result provides a useful understanding of the convergence properties of the random batch system in the mean field regime."

Using a semi-formal approach to generating functions, we extend both theorems beyond probability to a more general model $\mathrm{W_{\mathbb{C}}}$ with complex weights. We relate models $\mathrm{W_{co}}(d)$ to standard models $\mathrm{W_{Ma}}(d)$ based on Markov chains. The follow-up article will treat non-Archimedean models $\mathrm{W_{fo}}(k)$ in which weights are formal power series in $\mathbb{C}[[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_k]]$."
2505.12169,Symplectic classification for universal unfoldings of $A_n$ singularities in integrable systems,"['math.SG', 'math.DG']",['Elena A. Kudryavtseva'],"In the present paper, we obtain real-analytic symplectic normal forms for integrable Hamiltonian systems with $n$ degrees of freedom near singular points having the type ``universal unfolding of $A_n$ singularity'', $n\ge1$ (local singularities), as well as near compact orbits containing such singular points (semi-local singularities). We also obtain a classification, up to real-analytic symplectic equivalence, of real-analytic Lagrangian foliations in saturated neighborhoods of such singular orbits (semi-global classification). These singularities (local, semi-local and semi-global ones) are structurally stable. It turns out that all integrable systems are symplectically equivalent near their singular points of this type (thus, there are no local symplectic invariants). A complete semi-local (respectively, semi-global) symplectic invariant of the singularity is given by a tuple of $n-1$ (respectively $n-1+\ell$) real-analytic function germs in $n$ variables, where $\ell$ is the number of connected components of the complement of the singular orbit in the fiber. The case $n=1$ corresponds to non-degenerate singularities (of elliptic and hyperbolic types) of one-degree of freedom Hamiltonians; their symplectic classifications were known. The case $n=2$ corresponds to parabolic points, parabolic orbits and cuspidal tori, and the case $n\ge3$ -- to their higher-dimensional analogs."

In broader generality, we prove that adding modules supported on stability-zero vertices induces closed embeddings of quiver schemes, and show how in many cases the quiver scheme associated with the cornered algebra defines a limit to this system of embeddings. As an application, we show that there is an isomorphism between the underlying reduced schemes of certain equivariant Quot schemes and Nakajima quiver varieties."

We use this relation to prove new results about the generalised principle eigenvalues, as well as about uniqueness and non-uniqueness of stationary solutions of a generalised FKPP equation.

We explore the particular case where the configuration space of our mechanical system is a Lie group with certain symmetries. Here, the integrator simplifies based on the property that the tangent and cotangent bundles of Lie groups are trivializable.

Zhang']","We introduce the proximal optimal transport divergence, a novel discrepancy measure that interpolates between information divergences and optimal transport distances via an infimal convolution formulation. This divergence provides a principled foundation for optimal transport proximals and proximal optimization methods frequently used in generative modeling. We explore its mathematical properties, including smoothness, boundedness, and computational tractability, and establish connections to primal-dual formulations and adversarial learning. The proximal operator associated with the proximal optimal transport divergence can be interpreted as a transport map that pushes a reference distribution toward the optimal generative distribution, which approximates the target distribution that is only accessible through data samples. Building on the Benamou-Brenier dynamic formulation of classical optimal transport, we also establish a dynamic formulation for proximal OT divergences. The resulting dynamic formulation is a first order mean-field game whose optimality conditions are governed by a pair of nonlinear partial differential equations: a backward Hamilton-Jacobi equation and a forward continuity equation. Our framework generalizes existing approaches while offering new insights and computational tools for generative modeling, distributionally robust optimization, and gradient-based learning in probability spaces."

In this paper, we define a cobordism map on the instanton cube complex as a filtered chain map, and prove that it recovers the cobordism maps both in Khovanov homology and singular instanton theory.

Under certain conditions, one can even work with locally ordered manifolds. In this paper, we build the universal euclidean local order over every locally ordered space; in categorical terms, the subcategory of euclidean local orders is coreflective in the category of locally ordered spaces. Then we give conditions to ensure that it preserves the execution traces of the corresponding program. Our construction is based on a well-known correspondance between sheaves on a space and étale bundles over this space. This is a far reaching generalization of a result about realizations of graph products. We particularize the construction to locally ordered realization of precubical sets, and show that it admits a purely combinatorial description. With the same proof techniques, we show that, unlike for the topological realization, there is a unique precubical set whose locally ordered realization is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$."

In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3."

Leveraging the properties of matroids, we further delve into the characteristics of AC-groups. Additionally, we provide a formula to compute the clique number of the non-commuting graph of AC-groups, offering a new perspective on the structure of these groups"

We classify the invariant algebraic surfaces of degree $2$ of this differential system. After we describe the phase portraits in the Poincaré ball of this differential system having one of this invariant algebraic surfaces.
  The Poincaré ball is the closed unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose interior has been identified with $\mathbb{R}^3$, and his boundary, the $2$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, has been identified with the infinity of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Note that in the space $\mathbb{R}^3$ we can go to infinity in as many as directions as points has the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. A polynomial differential system as the Ehrhard-Müller system can be extended analytically to the Poincaré ball, in this way we can study its dynamics in a neigborhood of infinity. Providing these phase portraits in the Poincaré ball we are describing the dynamics of all orbits of the Ehrhard-Müller system having an invariant algebraic surface of degree $2$."

In this paper, we prove an Ore-type result on the existence of Hamiltonian Berge cycles in $[3]$-graph $\cH$, based on the degree sum of every pair of non-adjacent vertices in the $2$-shadow graph $\partial \cH$ of $\cH$. Namely, we prove that there exists a constant $d_0$ such that for all $n \geq 6$, if a $[3]$-graph $\cH$ on $n$ vertices satisfies that every pair $u,v \in V(\cH)$ of non-adjacent vertices has degree sum $d_{\partial \cH}(u) + d_{\partial \cH}(v) \geq n+d_0$, then $\cH$ contains a Hamiltonian Berge cycle. Moreover, we conjecture that $d_0=1$ suffices."

Our result extends prior work of David, Florea and Lalin, who obtained an asymptotic formula for the first moment. Our approach relies on analytic techniques (Perron's formula, approximate functional equation, etc), adapted to the function field context. A key step in the construction is to relate second moment to certain averages of Gauss sums, which are estimated in loc. cit. using results of Kubota and Hoffstein."

The indices $x,y$ range over the $d$-dimensional discrete torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ with $d\in \{1,2\}$ and $N=L^d$. The variance profile $S_{xy}=\mathbb E|h_{xy}|^2$ exhibits a banded structure: specifically, $S_{xy}=0$ whenever the distance $|x-y|$ exceeds a band width parameter $W\le L$. Let $W=L^α$ for some exponent $0<α\le 1$. We show that as $α$ increases from $\mathbf 1_{d=1}/2$ to $1-d/6$, the range of energies corresponding to delocalized eigenvectors gradually expands from the bulk toward the entire spectrum. More precisely, we prove that eigenvectors associated with energies $E$ satisfying $2 - |E| \gg N^{-c_{d,α}}$ are delocalized, where the exponent $c_{d,α}$ is given by $c_{d,α} = 2α- 1$ in dimension 1 and $c_{d,α} = α$ in dimension 2. Furthermore, when $α> 1-d/6$, all eigenvectors of $H$ become delocalized. We further establish quantum unique ergodicity for delocalized eigenvectors, as well as a rigidity estimate for the eigenvalues. Our findings extend previous results -- established in the bulk regime for one-dimensional (1D) (arXiv:2501.01718) and two-dimensional (2D) (arXiv:2503.07606) random band matrices -- to the entire spectrum, including the spectral edges.

The degrees of freedom of the proposed method are the same as those of traditional nonconforming FEMs, while the function space is modified to account for the jump conditions of the solution. The modified function space on an interface element is shown to exist uniquely, independent of the element's shape and the manner in which the interface intersects it. Optimal error estimates for the method, along with the usual bound on the condition number of the stiffness matrix, are proven, with the error constant independent of the interface's location relative to the mesh. To solve the resulting linear system, a preconditioner is proposed in which a Gauss-Seidel smoother with the interface correction is employed to ensure robustness against large jumps in the diffusion matrix. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the optimal convergence of the proposed method and the efficiency of the preconditioner."

Structure and Algorithms,"['math.CO', 'cs.DM', 'q-bio.PE']","['Takatora Suzuki', 'Momoko Hayamizu']","Reticulate evolution gives rise to complex phylogenetic networks, making their interpretation challenging. A typical approach is to extract trees within such networks. Since Francis and Steel's seminal paper, ""Which Phylogenetic Networks are Merely Trees with Additional Arcs?"" (2015), tree-based phylogenetic networks and their support trees (spanning trees with the same root and leaf set as a given network) have been extensively studied. However, not all phylogenetic networks are tree-based, and for the study of reticulate evolution, it is often more biologically relevant to identify support networks rather than trees. This study generalizes Hayamizu's structure theorem for rooted binary phylogenetic networks, which yielded optimal algorithms for various computational problems on support trees, to extend the theoretical framework for support trees to support networks. This allows us to obtain a direct-product characterization of each of three sets: all, minimal, and minimum support networks, for a given network. Each characterization yields optimal algorithms for counting and generating the support networks of each type. Applications include a linear-time algorithm for finding a support network with the fewest reticulations (i.e., the minimum tier). We also provide exact and heuristic algorithms for finding a support network with the minimum level, both running in exponential time but practical across a reasonably wide range of reticulation numbers."

The approach makes use of parametrized decoder functions, and provides a general, and principled way of understanding and analyzing stability and accuracy of nonlinear dynamical approximations. The parameters of these functions are evolved in time by means of projections on finite dimensional subspaces of an ambient Hilbert space related to the PDE evolution. For practical computations of these projections, one usually needs to sample. We propose a dynamical sampling strategy which comes with stability guarantees, while keeping a low numerical complexity.

With an additional structural assumption on the nonlinearity, we prove a continuous in time resolution result for radial solutions.
  The proof of the sequential resolution uses the channel of energy method, as in the scalar case treated by Duyckaerts, Kenig and Merle (Cambridge Journal of Mathematics 2013 and arXiv 1204.0031).

The approach requires that a function $W$ and an integer $λ$ can be found with the following two conditions: $q$ can be integrated with respect to $\operatorname{A}$ such that $\operatorname{A}^{λ+ k} W(x) = q(x)$, and $\operatorname{B}^{λ+ 1}$ annihilates $W$ such that $\operatorname{B}^{λ+ 1} W(x) = 0$.
  Applications include the Poisson equation $ΔQ(x) = q(x)$, the inhomogeneous polyharmonic equation $Δ^k Q(x) = q(x)$, the Helmholtz equation $(Δ+ ν) Q(x) = q(x)$ and the wave equation $\Box Q(x) = q(x)$.

The global convergence of the two proposed algorithms is established through the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz properties, ensuring convergence within a preconditioned framework for linear equations. Numerical experiments on two general non-convex problems: SCAD-penalized binary classification and graph-based Ginzburg-Landau image segmentation models, demonstrate the proposed method's high efficiency compared to existing DC algorithms both in convergence rate and solution accuracy."

It is observed that at a given iterate, the cubic regularized Newton direction is not necessarily a descent direction. In generating the sequence of iterates, no line search is utilized to find a suitable step length to move along the cubic regularized Newton direction. Yet, the proposed method exhibits a global convergence property with $O(k^{-2/3})$ rate of convergence. Further, the local q-quadratic convergence of the Newton method is also retained in the cubic regularization. A new stopping condition is used, which enforces the proposed method to enter in close neighborhood of non-weakly efficient points that are stationary. Thus, the studied technique ends up generating weakly efficient points, not just Pareto critical points. In addition, conditions on the choice of regularization parameter value under which the full cubic regularized Newton step becomes descent are derived. Performance profiles and comparison of the derived method with the existing methods on several test examples are also provided."

2505.11898,Nematic liquid crystals: Ericksen-Leslie theory with general stress tensors,['math.AP'],"['Matthias Hieber', 'Jinkai Li', 'Mathias Wilke']","The Ericksen-Leslie model for nematic liquid crystal flows in case of an isothermal and incompressible fluid with general Leslie stress and anisotropic elasticity, i.e. with general Ericksen stress tensor, is shown for the first time to be strongly well-posed. Of central importance is a fully nonlinear boundary condition for the director field, which, in this generality, is necessary to guarantee that the system fulfills physical principles. The system is shown to be locally, strongly well-posed in the $L_p$-setting. More precisely, the existence and uniqueness of a local, strong $L_p$-solution to the general system is proved and it is shown that the director $d$ satisfies $|d|_2\equiv 1$ provided this holds for its initial data $d_0$. In addition, the solution is shown to depend continuously on the data.
  The results are proven without any structural assumptions on the Leslie coefficients and in particular without assuming Parodi's relation."

Theoretically, we combine the fractional Duhamel's principle with the weak vanishing property to establish the uniqueness of this inverse problem. Numerically, we adopt an optimal control approach for determining the source term. A coupled forward-backward system of equations is derived using the first-order optimality condition. Finally, we construct a finite element conjugate gradient algorithm for the numerical inversion of the source term. Several experiments are presented to show the utility of the method."

We make a first step in this direction by establishing the unique identifiability of convex impenetrable obstacles from backscattering far field measurements. Specifically, we prove that both the boundary and the boundary conditions of the convex obstacle are uniquely determined by the far field pattern measured in backscattering directions for all frequencies. The key tool is Majda's asymptotic estimate of the far field patterns in the high-frequency regime. Furthermore, we introduce a fast and stable numerical algorithm for reconstructing the boundary and computing the boundary condition. A key feature of the algorithm is that the boundary condition can be computed even if the boundary is not known, and vice versa. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and robustness of the proposed algorithm."

Unlike known methods, this one does not involve any polyhedral decomposition or triangulation of the knot complement, and uses only a knot diagram satisfying a few mild restrictions. This gives a simple algorithm that can often be performed by hand, and in many cases, for an infinite family of knots at once. The algorithm yields an explicit description for the hyperbolic structures (complete or incomplete) that correspond to geometric representations of a hyperbolic knot. As an illustration, we give the formulas for the equations for the variety of closed alternating braids $(σ_1(σ_2)^{-1})^n$ that depend only on $n$."

By computing the critical groups of the associated energy functional for problem (1) at the origin and at infinity, respectively, we prove that problem (\ref{prob_0}) has three nontrivial solutions for the case $λ< λ_1$ and two nontrivial solutions for the case $λ\geqslantλ_1,$ where $λ_1$ is the first eigenvalue of the operator $-\mathcal{L}_K$. Finally, assuming that the nonlinearity $f$ is odd in the second variable, we prove the existence of an unbounded sequence of weak solutions of problem (1) for the case $λ\geqslantλ_1$.

2505.11762,A parameterized Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow approach for solving the Schrödinger equation,['math.NA'],"['Hao Wu', 'Shu Liu', 'Xiaojing Ye', 'Haomin Zhou']","In this paper, we propose a new method to compute the solution of time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE). Using push-forward maps and Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow, we reformulate the TDSE as a Hamiltonian system in terms of push-forward maps. The new formulation can be viewed as a generative model in the Wasserstein space, which is a manifold of probability density functions. Then we parameterize the push-forward maps by reduce-order models such as neural networks. This induces a new metric in the parameter space by pulling back the Wasserstein metric on density manifold, which further results in a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the parameters of the reduce-order model. Leveraging the computational techniques from deep learning, such as Neural ODE, we design an algorithm to solve the TDSE in the parameterized push-forward map space, which provides an alternative approach with the potential to scale up to high-dimensional problems. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm."

2505.11747,Structure of the Cayley-Dickson algebras,['math.RA'],['G. P. Wilmot'],"Viewing the Cayley-Dickson process as a graded construction provides a rigorous definition of associativity consisting of three types and the non-associative parts dividing into four types. These simplify the Moufang loop identities and Mal'cev's identity, which identifies the non-associative Lie algebra structure. This structure is distinct for the first four power-associative algebras and has the same pattern for at least the next three. The structure is identified with 3-cycles and modes that reduce sets of 84 zero divisors to just 7, in most cases, such as for the sedenions, and identifies the subalgebas of the power associative algebras that provide zero divisors thus defining the structure of Cayley-Dickson algebras. The zero divisor and octonion cardinality at all levels is derived. Split algebras are proved to be isomorphic for any power-associative algebra and share the same non-associative structure with different zero divisors. Due to the inclusion of new power-associative algebras into the hypercomplex algebras the terminology ultracomplex numbers is suggested."

We show that the internal logic of the topos of sets, when interpreted in the topos of quantum sets, provides the Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum propositional calculus of idempotents in a canonical internal commutative algebra of the topos of quantum sets. We extend this construction by allowing the quantum counterpart of Boolean algebras of classical truth values which we introduce and study in detail. We realize expected values of observables in quantum states in our topos of quantum sets as a tautological morphism from the canonical internal commutative algebra to a canonical internal object of affine functions on quantum states. We show also that in our topos of quantum sets one can speak about quantum quivers in the sense of Day-Street and Chikhladze. Finally, we provide a categorical derivation of the Leavitt path algebra of such a quantum quiver and relate it to the category of stable representations of the quiver. It is based on a categorification of the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra in the context of functor adjunctions replacing the customary use of Hilbert modules."
2505.11721,Variational principles for Hausdorff and packing dimensions of fractal percolation on self-affine sponges,"['math.PR', 'math.DS']","['Julien Barral', 'Guilhem Brunet']","We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Barański and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpiński sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions."
2505.11705,Consistency of Bayes factors for linear models,['math.ST'],"['Elías Moreno', 'J. J. Serrano-Pérez', 'F. Torres-Ruiz']","The quality of a Bayes factor crucially depends on the number of regressors, the sample size and the prior on the regression parameters, and hence it has to be established in a case-by-case basis. In this paper we analyze the consistency of a wide class of Bayes factors when the number of potential regressors grows as the sample size grows. We have found that when the number of regressors is finite some classes of priors yield inconsistency, and\ when the potential number of regressors grows at the same rate than the sample size different priors yield different degree of inconsistency. For moderate sample sizes, we evaluate the Bayes factors by comparing the posterior model probability. This gives valuable information to discriminate between the priors for the model parameters commonly used for variable selection."

More specifically, we consider either $1$- or $n$-shocks in characteristic fields which are either concave-convex or convex-concave in the sense of LeFloch. We show that the theory of $a$-contraction can be applied to obtain $L^2$-stability up to shift for these shocks in a class of weak solutions to the conservation law whose shocks obey the Lax entropy condition.

While the existing literature focuses on Gaussian inputs and benign disturbances, we significantly broaden the scope of admissible control inputs and allow correlated, nonzero-mean, adversarial disturbances. With our reformulation as a linear combination of basis functions, we prove that the $\ell_2$-norm estimator overcomes the challenges as long as the probability that the system is under adversarial attack at a given time is smaller than a certain threshold. We provide an estimation error bound that decays with the input memory length and prove its optimality by constructing a problem instance that suffers from the same bound under adversarial attacks. Our work provides a sharp input-output analysis for a generic nonlinear and partially observed system under significantly generalized assumptions compared to existing works."

AdaGD achieves the non-ergodic convergence rate $f(x_k) - f_\star = \mathcal{O}\left(1/k\right)$, like the original GD.

Russell']","Low-thrust, many-revolution spacecraft trajectories are increasingly required for mission design due to the efficiency and reliability of electric propulsion technology. Primer vector theory using averaged dynamics is well suited for such applications, but is difficult to implement in a way that maintains both optimality and computational efficiency. An improved model is presented that combines advances from several past works into a general and practical formulation for minimum-fuel, perturbed Keplerian dynamics. The model maintains computational efficiency of dynamics averaging with optimal handling of the eclipsing constraint and bang-bang control through the use of the Leibniz integral rule for multi-arc averaging. A subtle, but important singularity arising from the averaged eclipsing constraint is identified and fixed. A maximum number of six switching function roots per revolution is established within the averaged dynamics. This new theoretical insight provides a practical upper-bound on the number of thrusting arcs required for any low-thrust optimization problem. Variational equations are provided for fast and accurate calculation of the state transition matrix for use in targeting and optimization. The dynamics include generic two-body perturbations and an expanded state to allow for sensitivity calculations with respect to launch date and flight time. A 48-revolution GTO to GEO transfer is used to directly compare optimal averaged and unaveraged trajectories. The capabilities of averaged dynamics are then demonstrated with an optimal 486-revolution GTO to GEO minimum fuel transfer."

In particular, we derive its Craig-Sulem formulation firstly over the circle, then over the one-dimensional flat torus; the arising equations are similar to the pure capillary Water Waves for the ocean problem, apart from conformal factors and additional terms due to curvature terms. Then, we show its Hamiltonian structure and we derive constants of motions from symmetries, one of which is the invariance by the torus action. Thanks to this invariance, we show the existence of orbits of rotating wave solutions (which are the analogous of travelling waves of the ocean problem) by bifurcation from multiple eigenvalues in the spirit of Moser-Weinstein [44, 56] and Craig-Nicholls [22] variational approaches; in particular, we can parametrize such orbits by the angular momentum, and for each value of it they are unique. This will imply that each orbit is generated by symmetric rotating waves."
2505.11641,Challenges in Model Agnostic Controller Learning for Unstable Systems,['math.OC'],"['Mario Sznaier', 'Mustafa Bozdag']","Model agnostic controller learning, for instance by direct policy optimization, has been the object of renewed attention lately, since it avoids a computationally expensive system identification step. Indeed, direct policy search has been empirically shown to lead to optimal controllers in a number of cases of practical importance. However, to date, these empirical results have not been backed up with a comprehensive theoretical analysis for general problems. In this paper we use a simple example to show that direct policy optimization is not directly generalizable to other seemingly simple problems. In such cases, direct optimization of a performance index can lead to unstable pole/zero cancellations, resulting in the loss of internal stability and unbounded outputs in response to arbitrarily small perturbations. We conclude the paper by analyzing several alternatives to avoid this phenomenon, suggesting some new directions in direct control policy optimization."
2505.11638,Accelerating Natural Gradient Descent for PINNs with Randomized Nyström Preconditioning,"['math.NA', 'cs.LG']","['Ivan Bioli', 'Carlo Marcati', 'Giancarlo Sangalli']","Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) has emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for training neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs), such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of solving linear systems involving the Gramian matrix. While matrix-free NGD methods based on the conjugate gradient (CG) method avoid explicit matrix inversion, the ill-conditioning of the Gramian significantly slows the convergence of CG. In this work, we extend matrix-free NGD to broader classes of problems than previously considered and propose the use of Randomized Nyström preconditioning to accelerate convergence of the inner CG solver. The resulting algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing NGD-based methods and other state-of-the-art optimizers on a range of PDE problems discretized using neural networks."

We prove several generalizations of the avoidance principle that allow for intersections of hypersurfaces. First, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of two mean curvature flows is non-increasing over time, and we find precise information on how the dimension changes. We then show that the self-intersection of an immersed mean curvature flow has non-increasing dimension over time. Next, we extend the intersection dimension monotonicity to Brakke flows and level set flows which satisfy a localizability condition, and we provide examples showing that the monotonicity fails for general weak solutions. We find a localization result for level set flows with finitely many singularities, and as a consequence, we obtain a fattening criterion for these flows which depends on the behavior of intersections with smooth flows."

2505.11554,Multi-Objective Memory Bandwidth Regulation and Cache Partitioning for Multicore Real-Time Systems,"['math.OC', 'cs.AR', 'cs.DC', 'cs.OS']","['Binqi Sun', 'Zhihang Wei', 'Andrea Bastoni', 'Debayan Roy', 'Mirco Theile', 'Tomasz Kloda', 'Rodolfo Pellizzoni', 'Marco Caccamo']","Memory bandwidth regulation and cache partitioning are widely used techniques for achieving predictable timing in real-time computing systems. Combined with partitioned scheduling, these methods require careful co-allocation of tasks and resources to cores, as task execution times strongly depend on available allocated resources. To address this challenge, this paper presents a 0-1 linear program for task-resource co-allocation, along with a multi-objective heuristic designed to minimize resource usage while guaranteeing schedulability under a preemptive EDF scheduling policy. Our heuristic employs a multi-layer framework, where an outer layer explores resource allocations using Pareto-pruned search, and an inner layer optimizes task allocation by solving a knapsack problem using dynamic programming. To evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization algorithm, we profile real-world benchmarks on an embedded AMD UltraScale+ ZCU102 platform, with fine-grained resource partitioning enabled by the Jailhouse hypervisor, leveraging cache set partitioning and MemGuard for memory bandwidth regulation. Experiments based on the benchmarking results show that the proposed 0-1 linear program outperforms existing mixed-integer programs by finding more optimal solutions within the same time limit. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective multi-layer heuristic performs consistently better than the state-of-the-art multi-resource-task co-allocation algorithm in terms of schedulability, resource usage, number of non-dominated solutions, and computational efficiency."

The particularity of the controllability condition resides in the fact that it depends on the singular point which in turn depends on the control variable. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure that the functional determining the control is continuous over the entire domain of the parameter. Lower and upper solutions technique combined with a bisection algorithm is used to prove the controllability of the equation and to approximate the control. An example is given together with some numerical simulations. The results naturally extend to fractional differential equations."

It provides a flexible and efficient approach to modeling front propagation problems, optimal control problems, and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equations. The framework integrates numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs with operator splitting techniques and implements implicit methods for second-order derivative terms, ensuring convergence to viscosity solutions while achieving global rather than local optimization. Built with a high-performance C++ core, CASL-HJX efficiently handles mixed-order derivative systems with time-varying dynamics, making it suitable for real-world applications across multiple domains. We demonstrate the solver's versatility through tutorial examples covering various PDEs and through applications in neuroscience, where it enables the design of energy-efficient controllers for regulating neural populations to mitigate pathological synchrony. While our examples focus on these applications, the mathematical foundation of the solver makes it applicable to problems in finance, engineering, and machine learning. The modular architecture allows researchers to define computational domains, configure problems, and execute simulations with high numerical accuracy.

2505.11526,Code Retrieval for MILP Instance Generation,"['math.OC', 'cs.AI']","['Tianxing Yang', 'Huigen Ye', 'Hua Xu']","Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is widely used in fields such as scheduling, logistics, and planning. Enhancing the performance of MILP solvers, particularly learning-based solvers, requires substantial amounts of high-quality data. However, existing methods for MILP instance generation typically necessitate training a separate model for each problem class and are computationally intensive when generating new instances. To address these limitations, we reformulate the MILP Instance Generation task as MILP Code Generation task, enabling efficient, flexible, and interpretable instance generation through code. Since MILP instances generated from code can vary significantly in scale, we introduce MILP-EmbedSim, a new similarity metric that accurately measures the similarity between instances of varying sizes within the same problem class. Leveraging this metric, we propose MILP-Retrieval, a pipeline that retrieves generation code from library to produce MILP instances highly similar to target instance. MILP-Retrieval outperforms baselines in both MILP Code Generation and Instance Generation tasks, provides a novel perspective on MILP instance generation and opens new possibilities for learning-based solvers."

Motivated by the limitations of conventional methods in handling undersampled data and missing modalities, our approach unrolls a provably convergent optimization algorithm into a structured neural network architecture. Each phase of the network mimics a step of an adaptive forward-backward scheme with extrapolation, enabling the model to incorporate both data fidelity and nonconvex regularization in a principled manner. To enhance generalization across different acquisition settings, we integrate meta-learning, which enables the model to rapidly adapt to unseen sampling patterns and modality combinations using task-specific meta-knowledge. The proposed method is evaluated on the open source datasets, showing significant improvements in PSNR and SSIM over conventional supervised learning, especially under aggressive undersampling and domain shifts. Our results demonstrate the synergy of unrolled optimization, task-aware meta-learning, and modality fusion, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world clinical MRI reconstruction."
2505.11490,Duality for finitely valued algebras,['math.LO'],"['Marco Abbadini', 'Adam Přenosil']","The theory of natural dualities provides a well-developed framework for studying Stone-like dualities induced by an algebra $\mathbf{L}$ which acts as a dualizing object when equipped with suitable topological and relational structure. The development of this theory has, however, largely remained restricted to the case where $\mathbf{L}$ is finite. Motivated by the desire to provide a universal algebraic formulation of the existing duality of Cignoli and Marra or locally weakly finite MV-algebras and to extend it to a corresponding class of positive MV-algebras, in this paper we investigate Stone-like dualities where the algebra $\mathbf{L}$ is allowed to be infinite. This requires restricting our attention from the whole prevariety generated by $\mathbf{L}$ to the subclass of algebras representable as algebras of $\mathbf{L}$-valued functions of finite range, a distinction that does not arise in the case of finite $\mathbf{L}$. Provided some requirements on $\mathbf{L}$ are met, our main result establishes a categorical duality for this class of algebras, which covers the above cases of MV-algebras and positive MV-algebras."

A canonical example of such a bimodule is given by a residuated lattice acting on itself by division, in which case the Nagata product coincides with the so-called twist product of the residuated lattice. We show that, given some further structure, a pointed bimodule can be reconstructed from its restricted Nagata product. This yields an adjunction between the category of cyclic pointed residuated bimodules and a certain category of posemigroups with additional structure, which subsumes various known adjunctions involving the twist product construction."

In the uniform sampling case this generalizes the classic CLT of Goncharov for the number of cycles of a single random permutation. We also consider the case where tuples are weighted by a factor other than one, per joint orbit. We view this as an analogue of the Ewens measure, for tuples of commuting permutations, where our CLT generalizes the CLT by Hansen. Our proof uses saddle point analysis, in a context related to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotics and the theorem of Meinardus, but concerns a multiple pole situation. The proof is written in a self-contained manner, and hopefully in a manner accessible to a wider audience. We also indicate several open directions of further study related to probability, combinatorics, number theory, an elusive theory of random commuting matrices, and perhaps also geometric group theory."

Given a finite time $T>0$, under natural assumptions on the stochastic forcing and for sufficiently small initial data, we show that there exists a unique mild solution $(u^\varepsilon, θ^\varepsilon)$ up to a random stopping time $τ^\varepsilon \leq T$. Moreover, $\mathbb{P}(τ^\varepsilon = T) \geq 1 - C \varepsilon$, and the solution trajectories lie in the optimal regularity class $ (u^\varepsilon, θ^\varepsilon) \in \left( H^{1,p}_t(H_x^{-\tfrac{1}{2} - δ}) \cap L^p_t(H_x^{\tfrac{3}{2} - δ}) \right) \times C_t(H_x^{-\tfrac{1}{2} - δ}) $ for all sufficiently small $δ> 0$ and all $p > \tfrac{2}{1 - δ}$."

Beyond this classical setting, research has focused on two regimes: misspecified interpolation, where the kernel smoothness exceeds that of the target function, and superconvergence, where the target is smoother than the Hilbert space.
  This work addresses the latter, where smoother target functions yield improved convergence rates, and extends existing results by characterizing superconvergence for projections in general Hilbert spaces. We show that functions lying in ranges of certain operators, including adjoint of embeddings, exhibit accelerated convergence, which we extend across interpolation scales between these ranges and the full Hilbert space. In particular, we analyze Mercer operators and embeddings into $L_p$ spaces, linking the images of adjoint operators to Mercer power spaces. Applications to Sobolev spaces are discussed in detail, highlighting how superconvergence depends critically on boundary conditions. Our findings generalize and refine previous results, offering a broader framework for understanding and exploiting superconvergence. The results are supported by numerical experiments."

We analyze regularized stochastic gradient descent (reg-SGD), a variant of stochastic gradient descent that uses a Tikhonov regularization with time-dependent, vanishing regularization parameter. We prove strong convergence of reg-SGD to the minimum-norm solution of the original problem without additional boundedness assumptions. Moreover, we quantify the rate of convergence and optimize the interplay between step-sizes and regularization decay. Our analysis reveals how vanishing Tikhonov regularization controls the flow of SGD and yields stable learning dynamics, offering new insights into the design of iterative algorithms for convex problems, including those that arise in ill-posed inverse problems. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments on image reconstruction and ODE-based inverse problems."

Following the high regularity approach introduced by Grenier [44] for the Vlasov-Poisson system, we construct local-in-time solutions with analytic bounds uniform in the quasineutrality parameter $\varepsilon$. In contrast to the electrostatic case, the presence of a magnetic field and a solenoidal electric component leads to new oscillatory effects that require a refined decomposition of the electromagnetic fields and the introduction of dispersive correctors. We show that, after appropriate filtering, solutions converge strongly as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero to a limiting system describing kinetic electron magnetohydrodynamics (e-MHD). This is the first strong convergence result for the Vlasov-Maxwell system in the quasineutral limit under analytic regularity assumptions, providing a rigorous justification for the e-MHD reduction, widely used in modelling plasmas in tokamaks and stellarators."

When specialized to the case of multiple Wiener-Itô integrals, our results yield general multiplication formulae on the Poisson space under minimal conditions, naturally expressed in terms of partitions and diagrams.

Every graph has a numerical value of proper thinness and the graphs with proper thinness~1 are exactly the proper interval graphs. A graph is proper $k$-thin if its vertices can be ordered in such a way that there is a partition of the vertices into $k$ classes satisfying that for each triple of vertices $r < s < t$, such that there is an edge between $r$ and $t$, it is true that if $r$ and $s$ belong to the same class, then there is an edge between $s$ and $t$, and if $s$ and $t$ belong to the same class, then there is an edge between $r$ and $s$. The proper thinness is the smallest value of $k$ such that the graph is proper $k$-thin. In this work we focus on the calculation of proper thinness for trees. We characterize trees of proper thinness~2, both structurally and by their minimal forbidden induced subgraphs. The characterizations obtained lead to a polynomial-time recognition algorithm. We furthermore show why the structural results obtained for trees of proper thinness~2 cannot be straightforwardly generalized to trees of proper thinness~3."

It revisits introducing differential collision avoidance constraints for convex objects into an optimal control problem (OCP) using the separating hyperplane theorem. By framing this theorem as a classification problem, the hyperplanes are eliminated as optimisation variables from the OCP. This effectively transforms non-convex constraints into linear constraints. A bi-level algorithm computes the hyperplanes between the iterations of an optimisation solver and subsequently embeds them as parameters into the OCP. Experiments demonstrate the approach's favourable scalability towards cluttered environments and its applicability to various motion planning approaches.

We call this process \emph{the expansion strategy} and use it to establish novel results that enable us to prove stability. When the map $F_0$ is sufficiently smooth and has a hyperbolic fixed point, we show the fixed point is locally asymptotically stable if and only if $\|\nabla F_j\|_1<1$ for some finite number $j$. Our local stability results complement recent results obtained on Schur stability, and they can provide an alternative to the highly acclaimed Jury's algorithm. Also, we show the effectiveness of the expansion strategy in obtaining global stability results. Global stability results are obtained by integrating the expansion strategy with the embedding technique. Finally, we give illustrative examples to show the results' practical applicability across various discrete-time dynamical systems."

The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such the optimal long-term management of renewable natural resources and financial portfolio management. Each individual agent seeks to maximize the long-term average reward, which consists of a running reward and incomes from discrete impulses, where the unit intervention price depends on the market through a stationary supply rate. In a competitive market setting, we establish the existence of and explicitly characterize an equilibrium strategy within a large class of policies under mild conditions. Additionally, we formulate and solve the mean field control problem, in which agents cooperate with each other, aiming to realize a common maximal long-term average profit. To illustrate the theoretical results, we examine a stochastic logistic growth model and a population growth model in a stochastic environment with impulse control."

The new approach is based on a concept called GSLLN (Generalized Strong Law of Large Numbers), which extends the traditional SLLN. Using this concept, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence, which effectively decouple the properties of the function whose zero we are trying to find, from the properties of the measurement errors (noise sequence). The new approach provides an alternative to the two widely used approaches, namely the ODE approach and the martingale approach, and also permits a wider class of noise signals than either of the two known approaches. In particular, the ``noise'' or measurement error \textit{need not} have a finite second moment, and under suitable conditions, not even a finite mean. By adapting this method of proof, we also derive sufficient conditions for the convergence of zero-order SGD, wherein the stochastic gradient is computed using $2d$ function evaluations, but no gradient computations. The sufficient conditions derived here are the weakest to date, thus leading to a considerable expansion of the applicability of SA and SGD theory."

We study the long time behavior of this heat equation with independent multiplicative white noise and additive spacetime white noise, which is a singular SPDE in a singular environement and requires two different renormalization procedures. We prove that the solution is global in time with a strong a priori $L^p$ bound independent of the initial data in $C^{-\varepsilon}$ for large $p$. The quenched solution given the environment is shown to be an infinite dimensional Markov process which satisfies the strong Feller property. We prove exponential convergence to a unique invariant measure using a Doeblin criterion for the transition semigroup. In particular, our work is a generalization of a previous work by Tsatsoulis and Weber in a case which is not translation invariant hence the method makes no use of the reversibility of the dynamics or the explicit knowledge of the invariant measure and it is therefore in principle applicable to situations where these are not available such as the vector-valued case."

In this paper, we lay the foundations for a trace methods approach to equivariant algebraic $K$-theory. For $G$ a finite group, we construct a Dennis trace map from equivariant algebraic $K$-theory to a $G$-equivariant version of topological Hochschild homology; for $G$ the trivial group this recovers the ordinary Dennis trace map. We show that upon taking fixed points, this recovers the trace map of Adamyk--Gerhardt--Hess--Klang--Kong, and gives a trace map from the fixed points of coarse equivariant $A$-theory to the free loop space. We also establish important properties of equivariant topological Hochschild homology, such as Morita invariance, and explain why it can be considered as a multiplicative norm."

2505.11295,Prime Number Error Terms,['math.NT'],['Nathan Ng'],"In 1980 Montgomery made a conjecture about the true order of the error term in the prime number theorem. In 2012 the author made an analogous conjecture for the true order of the sum of the Möbius function, $M(x)$. This refined an earlier conjecture of Gonek from the 1990's. In this article we speculate on the true size of a large class of prime number error terms and present a general conjecture. This general conjecture includes both Montgomery's conjecture and the conjecture for $M(x)$ as special cases. Recently, Lamzouri (Springer volume: Essays in Analytic Number Theory, In Honor of Helmut Maier's 70th birthday) showed that an effective linear independence conjecture (ELI) for the zeros of the zeta function implies one of the inequalities in Montgomery's conjecture. In this article we adapt Lamzouri's method to show that a generalized effective linear independence (GELI) conjecture implies a lower bound for general prime number error terms. Furthermore, of independent interest, we prove an $L^2$ bound for almost periodic functions. This allows us to weaken significantly one of the conditions in Lamzouri's main result and also give an improvement of the main theorem in an article of Akbary-Ng-Shahabi (Q. J. Math. 65 (2014), no. 3)."

We show that the recently introduced generalized topological recursion on the $(r,s)$ spectral curves computes the descendant integrals of the $Θ^{r,s}$-classes. As a consequence, we deduce that the descendant potential of the $Θ^{r,s}$-classes is a tau function of the $r$-KdV hierarchy, generalizing the Brézin--Gross--Witten tau function (the special case $r=2$, $s=1$). We also explicitly compute the $\mathcal{W}$-constraints satisfied by the descendant potential, obtained as differential representations of the $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{gl}_r)$-algebra at self-dual level. This work extends previously known results on the Witten $r$-spin class, the $r$-spin $Θ$-classes (the case $s=r-1$), and the Norbury $Θ$-classes (the special case $r=2$, $s=1$)."

2505.11273,Bilevel Transmission Expansion Planning with Joint Chance-Constrained Dispatch,"['math.OC', 'eess.SY']","['Yuxin Xia', 'Yihong Zhou', 'Iacopo Savelli', 'Thomas Morstyn']","In transmission expansion planning (TEP), network planners make long-term investment decisions while anticipating market clearing outcomes that are increasingly affected by renewable generation uncertainty. Additionally, market participants' sensitivity to network charges and the requirement for cost recovery by the network planner introduce further complexity. Since the day-ahead market clears before uncertainty realizes, explicitly modelling these uncertainties at the lower-level market clearing becomes important in bilevel TEP problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel bilevel TEP framework with lower-level joint chance-constrained market clearing that manages line flow constraints under wind uncertainty and accounts for the effect of network tariffs on participants' actual marginal costs and utility. To solve this complex problem, we propose a Strengthened Linear Approximation (SLA) technique for handling Wasserstein distributionally robust joint chance constraints with right-hand-side uncertainties (RHS-WDRJCC). The proposed method offers more efficient approximations without additional conservativeness and avoids the numerical issues encountered in existing approaches by introducing valid inequalities. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the desired out-of-sample constraint satisfaction probability. Moreover, the numerical results highlight the significant computational advantage of SLA, achieving up to a 26x speedup compared to existing methods such as worst-case conditional value-at-risk, while maintaining high solution quality."

Dubbeldam', 'Vicente Lenz Burnier', 'Elena Pulvirenti', 'Martin Slowik']","We analyse the metastable behaviour of the disordered Curie-Weiss-Potts (DCWP) model subject to a Glauber dynamics. The model is a randomly disordered version of the mean-field $q$-spin Potts model (CWP), where the interaction coefficients between spins are general independent random variables. These random variables are chosen to have fixed mean (for simplicity taken to be $1$) and well defined cumulant generating function, with a fixed distribution not depending on the number of particles. The system evolves as a discrete-time Markov chain with single spin flip Metropolis dynamics at finite inverse temperature $β$. We provide a comparison of the metastable behaviour of the CWP and DCWP models, when $N \to \infty$. First, we establish the metastability of the CWP model and, using this result, prove metastability for the DCWP model (with high probability). We then determine the ratio between the metastable transition time for the DCWP model and the corresponding time for the CWP model. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic tail behavior and moments of this ratio. Our proof combines the potential-theoretic approach to metastability with concentration of measure techniques, the latter adapted to our specific context."

We apply our results to the problem of approximately finding a feasible point in a polytope intersection in high-dimensions, and demonstrate the practical efficiency of our algorithms through empirical results."
2505.11255,Parametric Model Order Reduction by Box Clustering with Applications in Mechatronic Systems,['math.NA'],"['Juan Angelo Vargas-Fajardo', 'Diana Manvelyan-Stroot', 'Catharina Czech', 'Pietro Botazzoli', 'Fabian Duddeck']","High temperatures and structural deformations can compromise the functionality and reliability of new components for mechatronic systems. Therefore, high-fidelity simulations (HFS) are employed during the design process, as they enable a detailed analysis of the thermal and structural behavior of the system. However, such simulations are both computationally expensive and tedious, particularly during iterative optimization procedures. Establishing a parametric reduced order model (pROM) can accelerate the design's optimization if the model can accurately predict the behavior over a wide range of material and geometric properties. However, many existing methods exhibit limitations when applied to wide design ranges.
  In this work, we introduce the parametric Box Reduction (pBR) method, a matrix interpolation technique that minimizes the non-physical influence of training points due to the large parameter ranges. For this purpose, we define a new interpolation function that computes a local weight for each design variable and integrates them into the global function. Furthermore, we develop an intuitive clustering technique to select the training points for the model, avoiding numerical artifacts from distant points. Additionally, these two strategies do not require normalizing the parameter space and handle every property equally. The effectiveness of the pBR method is validated through two physical applications: structural deformation of a cantilever Timoshenko beam and heat transfer of a power module of a power converter. The results demonstrate that the pBR approach can accurately capture the behavior of mechatronic components across large parameter ranges without sacrificing computational efficiency."

2505.11226,"Counting integral points in thin sets of type II: singularities, sieves, and stratification",['math.NT'],"['Dante Bonolis', 'Lillian B. Pierce', 'Katharine Woo']","Consider an absolutely irreducible polynomial $F(Y,X_1,\ldots,X_n) \in \mathbb{Z}[Y,X_1,\ldots,X_n]$ that is monic in $Y$ and is a polynomial in $Y^m$ for an integer $m \geq 1$. Let $N(F,B)$ count the number of $\mathbf{x} \in [-B,B]^n \cap \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $F(y,\mathbf{x})=0$ is solvable for $y \in\mathbb{Z}$. In nomenclature of Serre, bounding $N(F,B)$ corresponds to counting integral points in an affine thin set of type II. Previously, in this generality Serre proved $N(F,B) \ll_F B^{n-1/2}(\log B)^γ$ for some $γ<1$. When $m \geq 2$, this new work proves $N(F,B) \ll_{n,F,ε} B^{n-1+1/(n+1) + ε}$ under a nondegeneracy condition that encapsulates that $F(Y,\mathbf{X})$ is truly a polynomial in $n+1$ variables, even after performing any $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q})$ change of variables on $X_1,\ldots,X_n$. Under GRH, this result also holds when $m=1$. We show that generic polynomials satisfy the relevant nondegeneracy condition. Moreover, for a certain class of polynomials, we prove the stronger bound $N(F,B) \ll_{F} B^{n-1}(\log B)^{e(n)}$, comparable to a conjecture of Serre. A key strength of these results is that they require no nonsingularity property of $F(Y,\mathbf{X})$. The Katz-Laumon stratification for character sums, in a new uniform formulation appearing in a companion paper of Bonolis, Kowalski and Woo, is a key ingredient in the sieve method we develop to prove upper bounds that explicitly control any dependence on the size of the coefficients of $F$."

For the $\mathbb{K}[x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$-module $V_f$ of vector fields generating foliations that admit $C$ as an invariant set, we provide several conditions under which the module $V_f$ can be freely generated by a minimal generating set. In particular, when $n=2$ and $f$ is a weakly tame polynomial, we show that the $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$-module $V_f$ is freely generated by two polynomial vector fields, one of which is the Hamiltonian vector field induced by $f$, if and only if, $f$ belongs to the Jacobian ideal $\langle f_x, f_y\rangle$ in $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$.

Under the assumptions of strong convexity and gradient L-smoothness, we analyze convergence and extend the method to box-constrained optimization.

To this aim, we show that a method commonly used to study Rayleigh wave propagation is also applicable to the analysis of Love wave propagation. This approach is based on the explicit solution of an algebraic Riccati equation, which operates independently of the traditional Stroh formalism. The method provides a straightforward numerical algorithm to determine the wave amplitudes and speed{s}. Beyond its numerical simplicity, the method guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a subsonic wave speed, addressing a problem that remains unresolved in most Cosserat solids generalised {continua} theories. Although often overlooked, proving the existence of an admissible solution is, in fact, the key point that validates or invalidates the entire analytical approach used to derive the equation determining the wave speed. Interestingly, it is confirmed that the Love waves do not need the artificial introduction of a surface layer, as indicated in the literature."
2505.11093,Lasso and Partially-Rotated Designs,"['math.ST', 'cs.DS', 'stat.ML']",['Rares-Darius Buhai'],"We consider the sparse linear regression model $\mathbf{y} = X β+\mathbf{w}$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ is the design, $β\in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a $k$-sparse secret, and $\mathbf{w} \sim N(0, I_n)$ is the noise. Given input $X$ and $\mathbf{y}$, the goal is to estimate $β$. In this setting, the Lasso estimate achieves prediction error $O(k \log d / γn)$, where $γ$ is the restricted eigenvalue (RE) constant of $X$ with respect to $\mathrm{support}(β)$. In this paper, we introduce a new $\textit{semirandom}$ family of designs -- which we call $\textit{partially-rotated}$ designs -- for which the RE constant with respect to the secret is bounded away from zero even when a subset of the design columns are arbitrarily correlated among themselves.
  As an example of such a design, suppose we start with some arbitrary $X$, and then apply a random rotation to the columns of $X$ indexed by $\mathrm{support}(β)$. Let $λ_{\min}$ be the smallest eigenvalue of $\frac{1}{n} X_{\mathrm{support}(β)}^\top X_{\mathrm{support}(β)}$, where $X_{\mathrm{support}(β)}$ is the restriction of $X$ to the columns indexed by $\mathrm{support}(β)$. In this setting, our results imply that Lasso achieves prediction error $O(k \log d / λ_{\min} n)$ with high probability. This prediction error bound is independent of the arbitrary columns of $X$ not indexed by $\mathrm{support}(β)$, and is as good as if all of these columns were perfectly well-conditioned.
  Technically, our proof reduces to showing that matrices with a certain deterministic property -- which we call $\textit{restricted normalized orthogonality}$ (RNO) -- lead to RE constants that are independent of a subset of the matrix columns. This property is similar but incomparable with the restricted orthogonality condition of [CT05]."

These three models share some universal properties: occupation variables are unbounded, all these processes are of gradient type, their invariant measures are product with spatially homogeneous weights, and, notably, they are all attractive, meaning that the process preserves the partial order of measures along the dynamics. In view of hydrodynamics of large-scale interacting systems, dealing with processes taking values in unbounded configuration spaces is known to be a challenging problem. In the present paper, we show the hydrodynamic limit for all three models listed above in a comprehensive way, and show as a main result, that, under the diffusive time scaling, the hydrodynamic equation is given by the heat equation with model-dependent diffusion coefficient. Our novelty is showing the attractiveness for each model, which is crucial for the proof of hydrodynamics."

The minimum cardinality of such a set is known as the dom-forcing number of the graph G, denoted by Fd(G). A connected dom-forcing forcing set of a graph G, is a dom-forcing set of G that induces a sub graph of G which is connected. The connected dom-forcing number of G, Fcd(G), is the minimum size of a connected dom-forcing set. This study delves into the concept of the connected dom-forcing number Fcd(G), examining its properties and characteristics. Furthermore, it seeks to accurately determine Fcd(G) for several well-known graphs and their graph products."
2505.11028,Remarks on criticality theory for Schrödinger operators and its application to wave equations with potentials,['math.AP'],['Motohiro Sobajima'],"In this paper, we give an alternative perspective of the criticality theory for (nonnegative) Schrödinger operators. Schrödinger operator $S=-Δ+V$ is classified as subcritical/critical in terms of the existence/nonexistence of a positive Green function for the associated elliptic equation $Su=f$. Such a property strongly affects to the large-time behavior of solutions to the parabolic equation $\partial_tv+Sv=0$. In this paper, we propose a remarkable quantity in terms of the structure of Hilbert lattices, which keeps some important properties including the notion of criticality theory. As an application, we study the large-time behavior of solutions to the hyperbolic equation $\partial_t^2w+Sw=0$."

2505.10987,A Superlinearly Convergent Evolution Strategy,"['math.OC', 'cs.NE']",['Tobias Glasmachers'],"We present a hybrid algorithm between an evolution strategy and a quasi Newton method. The design is based on the Hessian Estimation Evolution Strategy, which iteratively estimates the inverse square root of the Hessian matrix of the problem. This is akin to a quasi-Newton method and corresponding derivative-free trust-region algorithms like NEWUOA. The proposed method therefore replaces the global recombination step commonly found in non-elitist evolution strategies with a quasi-Newton step. Numerical results show superlinear convergence, resulting in improved performance in particular on smooth convex problems."

Examples of such functions include Euler polynomials, alternating Hurwitz zeta functions and their associated Gamma functions. In this paper, we systematically investigate the fundamental properties of alternating invariant functions. We prove that the set of such functions is closed under translation, reflection, and differentiation. In addition, we define a convolution operation on alternating invariant functions and derive explicit convolution formulas for Euler polynomials and alternating Hurwitz zeta functions, respectively. Furthermore, using distributional relations, we construct new examples of alternating invariant functions, including suitable combinations of trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, among others."

These sets, possibly including singular spaces such as stratified spaces, exhibit different geometric properties depending on their regularity: sets that are not differentiable submanifolds may show sensitive dependence, for example, on parametrization, whereas for differentiable submanifolds invariance is preserved under reparametrization.
  This framework offers a broader perspective on geodesic preservation than the rigid notion of totally geodesic submanifolds, with examples arising naturally even in simple settings, such as linear spaces equipped with flat sprays."

We compute the gradient using algebraic Riccati equation and then couple it with a novel Armijo rule inspired step-size selection procedure. We perform numerical experiments of the proposed solution procedure on an exhaustive list of benchmark engineering systems to show its convergence properties. Finally we compare our proposed solution procedure with available semi-definite programming based gradient-descent algorithm to demonstrate its scalability.

This article introduces a new hyperbolic-type metric that provides an alternative approach to this limitation. The proposed metric coincides with the hyperbolic metric on balls and half-spaces, and, quite unexpectedly, agrees with the quasihyperbolic metric in unbounded domains. We compute the density of this metric in several classical domains and discuss aspects of its curvature. Furthermore, we establish characterizations of uniform domains and John disks in terms of the newly defined metric. In addition, we investigate several geometric properties of the metric, including the existence of geodesics and the minimal length of non-trivial closed curves in multiply connected domains."
2505.10956,The strong law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem for general Markov additive processes,['math.PR'],"['Andreas E. Kyprianou', 'Victor Rivero']","In this note we re-visit the fundamental question of the strong law of large numbers and central limit theorem for processes in continuous time with conditional stationary and independent increments. For convenience we refer to them as Markov additive processes, or MAPs for short. Historically used in the setting of queuing theory, MAPs have often been written about when the underlying modulating process is an ergodic Markov chain on a finite state space. Recent works have addressed the strong law of large numbers when the underlying modulating process is a general Markov processes. We add to the latter with a different approach based on an ergodic theorem for additive functionals and on the semi-martingale structure of the additive part. This approach also allows us to deal with the setting that the modulator of the MAP is either positive or null recurrent. The methodology additionally inspires a CLT-type result."
2505.10955,Tent transformed order $2$ nets and quasi-Monte Carlo rules with quadratic error decay,['math.NA'],"['Bernd Käßemodel', 'Nicolas Nagel', 'Tino Ullrich']","We investigate the use of order $2$ digital nets for quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature of nonperiodic functions with bounded mixed second derivative over the cube. By using the so-called tent transform and its mapping properties we inherit error bounds from the periodic setting. Our analysis is based on decay properties of the multivariate Faber-Schauder coefficients of functions with bounded mixed second weak derivatives. As already observed by Hinrichs, Markhasin, Oettershagen, T. Ullrich (Numerische Mathematik 2016), order $2$ nets work particularly well on tensorized (periodic) Faber splines. From this we obtain a quadratic decay rate for tent transformed order $2$ nets also in the nonperiodic setting. This improves the formerly best known bound for this class of point sets by a factor of $\log N$.
  We back up our findings with numerical experiments, even suggesting that the bounds for order $2$ nets can be improved even further. This particularly indicates that point sets of lower complexity (compared to previously considered constructions) may already give (near) optimal error decay rates for quadrature of functions with second order mixed smoothness."
2505.10935,Boundary Stabilization of Quasilinear Parabolic PDEs that Blow Up in Open Loop for Arbitrarily Small Initial Conditions,['math.AP'],"['M C Belhadjoudja', 'M Maghenem', 'E Witrant', 'M Krstic']","We propose a novel framework for stabilization, with an estimate of the region of attraction, of quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit finite-time blow-up phenomena when null boundary inputs are imposed. Using Neumann-type boundary controllers, which are cubic polynomials in boundary measurements, we ensure L2 exponential stability of the origin with an estimate of the region of attraction, boundedness and exponential decay towards zero of the state's max norm, well-posedness, as well as positivity of solutions starting from positive initial conditions. Unlike existing methods, our approach handles nonlinear state-dependent diffusion, convection, and reaction terms. In many cases, our estimate of the size of the region of attraction is shown to expand unboundedly as diffusion increases. Our controllers can be implemented as Neumann, Dirichlet, or mixed-type boundary conditions. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our approach in preventing finite-time blow up."
2505.10929,Minimal dispersion on the sphere,"['math.MG', 'math.NA']","['Alexander E.

We study the behavior of ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ as $n$ and $d$ grow to infinity. We develop connections to the problems of sphere covering and approximation of the Euclidean unit ball by inscribed polytopes. Existing and new results are presented in a unified way. Upper bounds on ${\rm disp}_{\mathcal{C}}(n,d)$ result from choosing the points independently and uniformly at random and possibly adding some well-separated points to close large gaps. Moreover, we study dispersion with respect to intersections of caps."

We consider a certain class of groups satisfying all of these properties and show that it is closed under the operation LH defined by Kropholler and the operation Φ defined by the second author. We thus generalize all previously known results regarding these properties over group algebras and place these results in an appropriate framework."

We show that for a broad class of odd initial data, the $H^s$-norm of solutions exhibits instantaneous blow-up for all $s > 7/2 $. Conversely, we establish that $H^3$-regularity is preserved for solutions that are odd with first-order cancellation, non-vanishing behavior away from the origin and Neumann boundary conditions on symmetric bounded domains. These theoretical results are further supported and illustrated by numerical simulations."
2505.10912,A sufficient condition for absence of mass quantization in a chemotaxis system with local sensing,['math.AP'],['Yuri Soga'],"We analyze blowup solutions in infinite time of the Neumann boundary value problem for the fully parabolic chemotaxis system with local sensing: \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  u_t = Δ(e^{-v}u)\qquad &\mathrm{in}\ Ω\times (0,\infty),
  v_t = Δv -v + u\qquad &\mathrm{in}\ Ω\times (0,\infty), \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $Ω$ is a ball in two-dimensional space and with nonnegative radially symmetric initial data. In the case of the Keller--Segel system which has a similar mathematical structure with our system, it was shown that the solutions blow up in finite time if and only if $L\log L$ for the first component $u$ diverges in finite time. On the other hand, focusing on the variational structure induced by a signal-dependent motility function $e^{-v}$, we show that an unboundedness of $\int_Ωe^v dx$ for the second component $v$ gives rise to blowup solutions in infinite time under the assumption of radial symmetry. Moreover we prove mass concentration phenomena at the origin. It is shown that the radially symmetric solutions of our system develop a singularity like a Dirac delta function in infinite time. Here we investigate the weight of this singularity. Consequently it is shown that mass quantization may not occur; that is, the weight of the singularity can exceed $8π$ under the assumption of a uniform-in-time lower bound for the Lyapunov functional. This type of behavior cannot be observed in the Keller--Segel system."
2505.10896,On Pseudospectral Concentration for Rank-1 Sampling,"['math.SP', 'math.NA', 'math.PR']","['Kuo Gai', 'Bin Shi']","Pseudospectral analysis serves as a powerful tool in matrix computation and the study of both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. Among various numerical strategies, random sampling, especially in the form of rank-$1$ perturbations, offers a practical and computationally efficient approach. Moreover, due to invariance under unitary similarity, any complex matrix can be reduced to its upper triangular form, thereby simplifying the analysis. In this study. we develop a quantitative concentration theory for the pseudospectra of complex matrices under rank-$1$ random sampling perturbations, establishing a rigorous probabilistic framework for spectral characterization. First, for normal matrices, we derive a regular concentration inequality and demonstrate that the separation radius scales with the dimension as $δ_d \sim 1/\sqrt{d}$. Next, for the equivalence class of nilpotent Jordan blocks, we exploit classical probabilistic tools, specifically, the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality and the Carbery-Wright anti-concentration inequality, to obtain singular concentration bounds, and demonstrate that the separation radius exhibits the same dimension-dependent scaling. This yields a singular pseudospectral concentration framework. Finally, observing that upper triangular Toeplitz matrices can be represented via the symbolic polynomials of nilpotent Jordan blocks, we employ partial fraction decomposition of rational functions to extend the singular framework to the equivalence class of upper triangular Toeplitz matrices."

  generalize various subclasses of starlike and convex functions, respectively. In this paper, sharp bounds are established for certain Toeplitz determinants constructed over the coefficients and logarithmic coefficients of inverse functions belonging to $\mathcal{S}^*(\varphi)$ and $\mathcal{C}(\varphi)$. Since these classes covers many well-known subclasses, the derived bounds are directly applicable to them as well."

While existing theory on distributed momentum Stochastic Gradient Descent (mSGD) mainly focuses on time-averaged convergence, the more practical last-iterate convergence remains underexplored. In this work, we analyze the last-iterate convergence behavior of distributed mSGD in non-convex settings under the classical Robbins-Monro step-size schedule. We prove both almost sure convergence and $L_2$ convergence of the last iterate, and derive convergence rates. We further show that momentum can accelerate early-stage convergence, and provide experiments to support our theory."
2505.10857,A high-order Newton multigrid method for steady-state shallow water equations,['math.NA'],"['Xiaowen Wang', 'Chunwu Wang', 'Guanghan Li', 'Zhicheng Hu']","A high-order Newton multigrid method is proposed for simulating steady-state shallow water flows in open channels with regular and irregular geometries. The method integrates two components: (1) a finite volume discretization with third-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction for the governing shallow water equations, (2) a Newton-multigrid method with an efficient approximation of the Jacobian matrix for the resulting discrete system. Generating the full Jacobian matrix in Newton iterations causes substantial computational costs. To address this problem, we observe that the majority of the non-zero elements in the matrix exhibit negligible magnitudes. By eliminating these elements, we approximate the Jacobian matrix with fewer stencils, thereby significantly reducing calculation time. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed simplification strategy improves computational efficiency while maintaining convergence rates comparable to those of the full Jacobian approach. Furthermore, the geometric multigrid method with a successive over-relaxation fast-sweeping smoother is employed for the linearized system to optimize performance. A variety of numerical experiments, including one-dimensional smooth subcritical flow, flows over a hump, and two-dimensional hydraulic jump over a wedge, are carried out to illustrate the third-order accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the proposed method."

Numerous authors have attempted to investigate such properties of subspaces. This article explores two important facets of approximation theory within Banach spaces and how these properties remain intact when considering the sum of two subsets. Recall the notion of $(GC)$ introduced by Veselý that encloses two aforementioned properties. When the sum of two subspaces is closed, we discuss various properties of the sum if one of the subspaces has these properties. Counterexamples are produced that establish nonaffirmativeness for the properties $(GC)$ and the central subspace. We answer a problem raised by the author in [{\em Best constrained approximation in Banach spaces}, Numer. Funct. Anal. Optim. {\bf 36}(2) (2015), 248--255].

2505.10830,A Discretization Approach for Bilevel Optimization with Low-Dimensional and Non-Convex Lower-Level,['math.OC'],"['Xiaotian Jiang', 'Ioannis Tsaknakis', 'Prashant Khanduri', 'Mingyi Hong']","Bilevel optimization (BLO) problem, where two optimization problems (referred to as upper- and lower-level problems) are coupled hierarchically, has wide applications in areas such as machine learning and operations research. Recently, many first-order algorithms have been developed for solving bilevel problems with strongly convex and/or unconstrained lower-level problems; this special structure of the lower-level problem is needed to ensure the tractability of gradient computation (among other reasons). In this work, we deal with a class of more challenging BLO problems where the lower-level problem is non-convex and constrained. We propose a novel approach that approximates the value function of the lower-level problem by first sampling a set of feasible solutions and then constructing an equivalent convex optimization problem. This convexified value function is then used to construct a penalty function for the original BLO problem. We analyze the properties of the original BLO problem and the newly constructed penalized problem by characterizing the relation between their KKT points, as well as the local and global minima of the two problems. We then develop a gradient descent-based algorithm to solve the reformulated problem, and establish its finite-time convergence guarantees. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to corroborate the theoretical performance of the proposed algorithm."

In this circumstance, we show that this problem distills to a convex optimal control problem, in which the optimization domain is the associated Youla parameter for the closed-loop system. This enables the globally-optimal controller to be solved as an infinite-dimensional but convex optimization. Near-optimal solutions may be found through the finite-dimensional convex truncation of this infinite-dimensional domain. The idea is demonstrated on a simple vibration suppression example."

2505.10801,Asymptotics of Constrained Quantization for Compactly Supported Measures,"['math.MG', 'math.CA', 'math.FA', 'math.OC', 'math.PR']",['Chenxing Qian'],"We investigated the asymptotics of high-rate constrained quantization errors for a compactly supported probability measure P on Euclidean spaces whose quantizers are confined to a closed set S. The key tool is the metric projection of K onto S that assigns each source point to its nearest neighbor in S, allowing the errors to be transferred to the projection, where K = supp P. For the upper estimate, we establish a projection pull-back inequality that bounds the errors by the classical covering radius of the projection. For the lower estimate, a weighted distance function enables us to perturb any quantizer element lying on the projection slightly into the complement in S without enlarging the error, provided the projection is nowhere dense (automatically true when S and K are disjoint). Under mild conditions on the pushforward measure of P by T, obtained via a measurable selector T, we derive a uniform lower bound. If this set is Ahlfors regular of dimension d, the error decays like the reciprocal of the d-th root of n and every constrained quantization dimension equals d. The two estimates coincide, giving the first complete dimension comparison formula for constrained quantization and closing the gap left by earlier self-similar examples by Pandey-Roychowdhury while extending classical unconstrained theory to closed constraints under mild geometric assumptions."

Each iteration of them is reduced to a convex optimization problem, which generally needs to be solved by iterative methods such as proximal gradient algorithm. However, these algorithms essentially belong to some iterative methods of fixed point problems of averaged mappings, and their convergence speed is generally slow. Furthermore, there is seldom research on the termination rule of these iterative algorithms solving the subproblem of DCA. To overcome these defects, we ffrstly show that the subproblem of the linearized proximal method (LPM) in each iteration is equal to the ffxed point problem of a contraction. Secondly, by using Picard iteration to approximately solve the subproblem of LPM in each iteration, we propose a contractive difference-ofconvex algorithm (cDCA) where an adaptive termination rule is presented. Both global subsequential convergence and global convergence of the whole sequence of cDCA are established. Finally, preliminary results from numerical experiments are promising."

2505.10783,A local framework for proving combinatorial matrix inversion theorems,['math.CO'],"['Aditya Khanna', 'Nicholas A.

The entries of such matrices often count signed, weighted combinatorial structures such as semistandard tableaux, rim-hook tableaux, or brick tabloids. Bijective proofs that two such matrices are inverses of each other may be difficult to find. This paper presents a general framework for proving such inversion results in the case where the combinatorial objects are built up recursively by successively adding some incremental structure such as a single horizontal strip or rim-hook. In this setting, we show that a sequence of matrix inversion results $A_nB_n=I$ can be reduced to a certain ``local'' identity involving the incremental structures. Here, $A_n$ and $B_n$ are matrices that might be non-square, and the columns of $A_n$ and the rows of $B_n$ indexed by compositions of $n$. We illustrate the general theory with four classical applications involving the Kostka matrices, the character tables of the symmetric group, incidence matrices for composition posets, and matrices counting brick tabloids. We obtain a new, canonical bijective proof of an inversion result for rectangular Kostka matrices, which complements the proof for the square case due to Eğecioğlu and Remmel. We also give a new bijective proof of the orthogonality result for the irreducible $S_n$-characters that is shorter than the original version due to White."

2505.10763,Odd Shifted Parking Functions,['math.CO'],"['Zachary Hamaker', 'Jesse Kim']","Stanley recently introduced the shifted parking function symmetric function $SH_n$, which is the shiftification of Haiman's parking function symmetric function $PF_n$. The function $SH_n$ lives in the subalgebra of symmetric functions generated by odd power sums. Stanley showed how to expand $SH_n$ into the $V-$basis of this algebra, which is indexed by partitions with all parts odd and is analogous to the complete homogeneous (or elementary) basis of symmetric functions. We introduce odd shifted parking functions to give combinatorial and representation-theoretic realizations of the $V-$expansion of $SH_n$, resolving the main open problem in his paper. Further, we present two representation-theoretic realizations of shiftification allowing us to interpret $SH_n$ as the spin character of a projective representation. We conclude with further directions, including a relationship between $SH_n$ and Haglund's $(q,t)-$Schröder theorem."

2505.10747,Assumption-lean weak limits and tests for two-stage adaptive experiments,"['math.ST', 'stat.ME']","['Ziang Niu', 'Zhimei Ren']","Adaptive experiments are becoming increasingly popular in real-world applications for effectively maximizing in-sample welfare and efficiency by data-driven sampling. Despite their growing prevalence, however, the statistical foundations for valid inference in such settings remain underdeveloped. Focusing on two-stage adaptive experimental designs, we address this gap by deriving new weak convergence results for mean outcomes and their differences. In particular, our results apply to a broad class of estimators, the weighted inverse probability weighted (WIPW) estimators. In contrast to prior works, our results require significantly weaker assumptions and sharply characterize phase transitions in limiting behavior across different signal regimes. Through this common lens, our general results unify previously fragmented results under the two-stage setup. To address the challenge of potential non-normal limits in conducting inference, we propose a computationally efficient and provably valid plug-in bootstrap method for hypothesis testing. Our results and approaches are sufficiently general to accommodate various adaptive experimental designs, including batched bandit and subgroup enrichment experiments. Simulations and semi-synthetic studies demonstrate the practical value of our approach, revealing statistical phenomena unique to adaptive experiments."

In particular, for $j=2k$, this corresponds to the usual $RO(C_3)$-graded homotopy groups of spheres $π^{C_3}_{i-j+kλ}$ for some fixed 2-dimensional $C_3$-faithful representation $λ$. We also describe the geometric fixed point map $Φ^{C_3}: π_{i, j}^{C_3}\to π_{i-j}^{cl}$ and the underlying map $Res: π_{i, j}^{C_3}\to π_{i}^{cl}$."
2505.10739,Prefix-bounded matrices,"['math.CO', 'cs.DM', 'cs.DS', 'math.OC']","['Nóra A. Borsik', 'András Frank', 'Péter Madarasi', 'Tamás Takács']","By unifying various earlier extensions of alternating sign matrices (ASMs), we introduce the notion of prefix-bounded matrices (PBMs). It is shown that the convex hull of these matrices forms the intersection of two special generalized polymatroids. This implies $\unicode{x2013}$ in a more general form $\unicode{x2013}$ that the linear inequality system given by Behrend and Knight (2007) and by Striker (2007, 2009) for describing the polytope of alternating sign matrices is totally dual integral (TDI), confirming a recent conjecture of Edmonds (2024, 2025). By relying on the polymatroidal approach, we derive a characterization for the existence of prefix-bounded matrices meeting lower and upper bounds on their entries. Furthermore, we point out that the constraint matrix of the linear system describing the convex hull of PBMs, in particular ASMs, is a network matrix. This implies that (a) standard network-flow techniques can be used to manage algorithmically optimization and structural results on PBMs obtained via g-polymatroids, (b) the linear system is actually box-TDI, and (c) the convex hull of PBMs admits a sharpened form of the integer Carathéodory property, in particular, the integer decomposition property. This latter feature makes it possible to confirm an extended form of an elegant conjecture of Brualdi and Dahl (2023) on the decomposability of a so-called $k$-regular alternating sign matrix as the sum of $k$ pattern-disjoint ASMs."

2505.10727,Between burning and cooling: liminal burning on graphs,['math.CO'],"['Anthony Bonato', 'Trent G. Marbach', 'John Marcoux', 'Teddy Mishura']","Liminal burning generalizes both the burning and cooling processes in graphs. In $k$-liminal burning, a Saboteur reveals $k$-sets of vertices in each round, with the goal of extending the length of the game, and the Arsonist must choose sources only within these sets, with the goal of ending the game as soon as possible. The result is a two-player game with the corresponding optimization parameter called the $k$-liminal burning number. For $k = |V(G)|$, liminal burning is identical to burning, and for $k = 1$, liminal burning is identical to cooling.
  Using a variant of Sperner sets, $k$-liminal burning numbers of hypercubes are studied along with bounds and exact values for various values of $k$. In particular, we determine the exact cooling number of the $n$-dimensional hypercube to be $n.$ We analyze liminal burning for several graph families, such as Cartesian grids and products, paths, and graphs whose vertex sets can be decomposed into many components of small diameter. We consider the complexity of liminal burning and show that liminal burning a graph is PSPACE-complete for $k\geq 2,$ using a reduction from $3$-QBF. We also prove, through a reduction from burning, that even in some cases when liminal burning is likely not PSPACE-complete, it is co-NP-hard. We finish with several open problems."

This provides an explicit description of the spectral action constructed by Fargues-Scholze in certain cases and allows us to prove some strongly generic part of the categorical local Langlands conjecture for $GL_n$ with torsion coefficients. As applications, we are able to prove an analogue of the Harris-Viehmann conjecture and deduce new vanishing results for the cohomology of Shimura varieties of type A in the torsion coefficient setting."
2505.10713,Maximum likelihood discretization of the transport equation,"['math.NA', 'stat.CO']","['Brook Eyob', 'Florian Schäfer']","The transport of positive quantities underlies countless physical processes, including fluid, gas, and plasma dynamics. Discretizing the associated partial differential equations with Galerkin methods can result in spurious nonpositivity of solutions. We observe that these methods amount to performing statistical inference using the method of moments (MoM) and that the loss of positivity arises from MoM's susceptibility to producing estimates inconsistent with the observed data. We overcome this problem by replacing MoM with maximum likelihood estimation, introducing $\textit{maximum likelihood discretization} $(MLD). In the continuous limit, MLD simplifies to the Fisher-Rao Galerkin (FRG) semidiscretization, which replaces the $L^2$ inner product in Galerkin projection with the Fisher-Rao metric of probability distributions. We show empirically that FRG preserves positivity. We prove rigorously that it yields error bounds in the Kullback-Leibler divergence."

In particular, for a fixed prime integer, we provide a geometric description of the weak normalization of an affine semigroup with respect to that prime, which corresponds to the weak normalization of the affine semigroup ring over a field of that prime characteristic, similar to the description of the seminormalization of an affine semigroup given by Reid-Roberts. We then use this description to understand the singularities of an affine semigroup ring defined over a field of prime characteristic and provide several examples. In particular, we demonstrate that all affine semigroup rings defined over fields of prime characteristic have a uniform upper bound on the Frobenius test exponent of all ideals, which provides a large and important class of examples with a positive answer to a question of Katzman-Sharp on uniformity of Frobenius test exponents. Finally, we provide an algorithm and implementation to compute the weak normalization of an affine semigroup, as well as the Frobenius test exponent and Frobenius closures of ideals in the affine semigroup ring."

The resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is $3$-Calabi-Yau, and can sometimes be endowed with the structure of a $3$-preprojective algebra. However, not every such $R \ast G$ admits such a structure. The finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ are classified into types (A) to (L). We consider the groups $G$ of types (C) and (D) and determine for each such group whether the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure. We show that the algebra $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure if and only if $9 \mid |G|$. Our proof is constructive and yields a description of the involved $2$-representation infinite algebras. This is based on the semi-direct decomposition $G \simeq N \rtimes K$ for an abelian group $N$, and we show that the existence of a $3$-preprojective structure on $R \ast G$ is essentially determined by the existence of one on $R \ast N$. This provides new classes of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and we discuss some $2$-Auslander-Platzeck-Reiten tilts. Along the way, we give a detailed description of the involved groups and their McKay quivers by iteratively applying skew-group constructions."

The entropic relaxation gives rise to the rescaling problem of a given tensor. This rescaling can be achieved fast with the Sinkhorn type algorithms. Recently, it was shown that a similar approach works for the quantum MPOTP. However, the analog of the rescaling Sinkhorn algorithm is much more complicated than in the classical MPOTP. In this paper we show that the interior point method (IPM) for the primary and dual problems of classical and quantum MPOTP problems can be considered as barrier relaxations of the optimal transport problems (OTP). It is well known that the dual of the OTP are advantageous as it has much less variables than the primary problem. The IPM for the dual problem of the classical MPOTP are not as fast as the Sinkhorn type algorithm. However, IPM method for the dual of the quantum MPOTP seems to work quite efficiently."

After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios.

Such a formulation enables enhanced flexibility among agents when optimizing their maximization variables. To address the problem, we propose two distributed gradient methods over networks, termed Distributed Gradient Tracking Ascent (DGTA) and Distributed Stochastic Gradient Tracking Ascent (DSGTA). We demonstrate that DGTA achieves an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(κ^2\varepsilon^{-2})$, and DSGTA attains a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(κ^3\varepsilon^{-4})$ for nonconvex strongly concave (NC-SC) objective functions. Both results match those of their centralized counterparts up to constant factors related to the communication network.

We prove that a very general non-syzygetic cubic fourfold has precisely one nontrivial Fourier-Mukai partner that is also non-syzygetic. We characterise non-syzygetic cubic fourfolds algebraically as those having a special type of equation that is almost linear determinantal, and show that the equation of the Fourier-Mukai partner can be obtained by applying Gale duality. We establish that Gale dual cubics are birational, Fourier-Mukai partners and have birational Fano varieties of lines under suitable genericity assumptions, recovering a result of Brooke-Frei-Marquand. We show that the birationality of the Fano varieties of lines continues to hold in the context of equivariant birational geometry, but birationality of the cubics may not. We exhibit examples of Gale dual cubics with faithful actions of the alternating group on four letters that could provide counterexamples to equivariant versions of a conjecture by Brooke-Frei-Marquand predicting birationality of the cubics if the Fano varieties of lines are birational, and also possibly a related conjecture by Huybrechts predicting birationality of Fourier-Mukai partners."

Regular level sets of the functions in our classification encompass almost all previously known examples of isoparametric hypersufaces in Damek-Ricci space and also yield new ones. For the new examples, the focal varieties are determined and the mean curvatures of the regular level sets are expressed as a function of the distance from the focal variety. We also study the exceptional case of tubes about $\mathbb R\mathbf H^k$ in $\mathbb C\mathbf H^k$, which are isoparametric, but cannot be obtained as the level sets of any function in our classification. We show that these tubes are level sets of a polynomial function divided by $t^2$, and that analogous functions on Damek-Ricci spaces can be isoparametric only in the case of $\mathbb C\mathbf H^k$."

We study the extinction time $τ_{G_n}$ of the contact process on the graph restricted to a d-dimensional box of volume n, starting from full occupancy. In the regime $β\in (2, 3)$, where the degrees have finite mean but infinite variance and the graph exhibits the ultra-small world behaviour, we adapt the techniques of [Linker et al., 2021] to show that $τ_{G_n}$ is exponential in n. Our main contribution, though, deals with the case $β\geq 3$, where the degrees have finite variance and the graph is small-world. We prove that also in this case $τ_{G_n}$ grows exponentially, at least up to a logarithmic correction reflecting the sparser graph structure. The proof requires the generalization of a result from [Mountford et al., 2016] and combines a multi-scale analysis of the graph, the study of the chemical distance between vertices and percolation arguments."
2505.10580,Sharp asymptotics for the KPP equation with some front-like initial data,['math.AP'],['Mingmin Zhang'],"We provide the first PDE proof of the celebrated Bramson's $o(1)$ results in 1983 concerning the large time asymptotics for the KPP equation under front-like initial data of types $x^{k+1}e^{-λ_*x}$ and $x^{\boldsymbolν} e^{-λx}$ as $x$ tends to infinity, where $0<λ<λ_*=\sqrt{f'(0)}$ and $k, \boldsymbolν\in\mathbb{R}$. Specifically, our results are the following: For the former type initial data, we prove that the position of the level sets is asymptotically $c_*t+\frac{k}{2λ_*}\ln t+\mathcal{O}(1)$ if $k>-3$, is $c_*t-\frac{3}{2λ_*}\ln t+\frac{1}{λ_*}\ln\ln t+\mathcal{O}(1)$ if $k=-3$, where $c_*=2λ_*$. In sharp contrast, if $k<-3$ and if $u_0$ belongs to $\mathcal{O}(x^{k+1}e^{-λ_* x})$ for $x$ large, then the position of the level sets behaves asymptotically like $c_*t-\frac{3}{2λ_*}\ln t+σ_\infty+o(1)$, with $σ_\infty\in\mathbb{R}$ depending on the initial condition $u_0$. Regarding the latter type initial data, we show that the level sets behave asymptotically like $ct+\frac{\boldsymbolν}λ\ln t$ up to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ error in general setting, with $c=λ+f'(0)/λ$. Under the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ results, the ``convergence along level sets'' results are also demonstrated. Moreover, we further refine the above $\mathcal{O}(1)$ results to the ``convergence to a traveling wave'' results provided that initial data decay precisely as a multiple of the above decaying rates."

Let $\mathcal{G}$ denote a random tensor of order $r$ and dimension $n$ drawn from the density \[
  f(\mathcal{G}) \propto \exp\bigg(-\frac{1}{2r}\|\mathcal{G}\|^2_{\mathrm{F}}\bigg). \] For $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{S}^{n - 1}$, the unit-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we consider the matrix-valued contraction $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{w}^{\otimes (r - 2)}$ when both $r$ and $n$ go to infinity such that $r / n \to c \in [0, \infty]$. We obtain semi-circle bulk-limits in all regimes, generalising the works of Goulart et al. (2022); Au and Garza-Vargas (2023); Bonnin (2024) in the fixed-$r$ setting.
  We also study the edge-spectrum. We obtain a Baik-Ben Arous-Péché phase-transition for the largest and the smallest eigenvalues at $r = 4$, generalising a result of Mukherjee et al. (2024) in the context of adjacency matrices of random hypergraphs. We also show that the extreme eigenvectors of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{w}^{\otimes (r - 2)}$ contain non-trivial information about the contraction direction $\mathbf{w}$.
  Finally, we report some results, in the case $r = 4$, on mixed contractions $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{S}^{n - 1}$. While the total variation distance between the joint distribution of the entries of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$ and that of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u}$ goes to $0$ when $\|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\| = o(n^{-1})$, the bulk and the largest eigenvalues of these two matrices have the same limit profile as long as $\|\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}\| = o(1)$. Furthermore, it turns out that there are no outlier eigenvalues in the spectrum of $\mathcal{G} \cdot \mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v}$ when $\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = o(1)$."

  With respect to this question, we establish several positive results but show that in general the answer is negative. In particular, we prove that if the composition factors of G which are isomorphic to simple groups of Lie type in characteristic p, have Lie rank at most n, then the order of P modulo O_p(G) is bounded in terms of n and e only. If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then the order of P modulo O_p(G) is bounded in terms e only. Some other results of similar flavour are established.

2505.10514,Optimal Pricing With Impatient Customers,['math.OC'],"['Jieqi Di', 'Sigrún Andradóttir', 'Hayriye Ayhan']","We investigate the optimal pricing strategy in a service-providing framework, where customers can become impatient and leave the system prior to service completion. In this setting, a price is quoted to an incoming customer based on the current number of customers in the system. When the quoted price is lower than the price the incoming customer is willing to pay (which follows a fixed probability distribution), then the customer joins the system and a reward equal to the quoted price is earned. A cost is incurred upon abandonment and a holding cost is incurred for customers waiting to be served. Our goal is to determine the pricing policy that maximizes the long-run average profit. Unlike traditional queueing systems without abandonments, we show that the optimal quoted prices do not always increase with the queue length in this setting. In particular, we prove that the optimal pricing policy is always uni-modal and provide conditions guaranteeing that the optimal policy is increasing in the number of customers in the system. Moreover, we introduce two heuristics that simplify the optimal dynamic pricing policy. Both heuristics admit customers until the number of customers in the system reaches a certain threshold. The cutoff static policy charges all admitted customers a fixed price while the two price policy charges one price when the arriving customer can enter service immediately and another price if the customer needs to wait. By selecting the price(s) and threshold that maximize the long-run average profit, both heuristics achieve near optimality and the two price policy provides more robustness compared to the cutoff static policy."

First, by utilizing the vertical fluid dissipation, we show that $\lnη(t) \in L^1$ for any $t>0$ provided that $\lnη_0\in L^1$, ensuring that additional plate contact can form only on a set of a measure zero. Then, by utilizing the expanding capability of compressible fluid pressure, we show that all contact has to detach in finite time provided that the source force acting onto the plate is not pushing down excessively. Finally, we show that contact at any point can be detached in any given time with a strong enough source force localized around that point which is pulling the plate up. The results are based on a novel variational inequality which preserves key information about the total force applied onto the plate, even in presence of contact. This is the first result where detachment of contact is proven in fluid-structure interaction."

2505.10503,Infinite multiplicity of positive solutions of an inhomogeneous supercritical elliptic equation on $\mathbb{R}^N$,['math.AP'],"['Sho Katayama', 'Yasuhito Miyamoto']","We are concerned with positive radial solutions of the inhomogeneous elliptic equation $Δu+K(|x|)u^p+μf(|x|)=0$ on $\mathbb{R}^N$, where $N\ge 3$, $μ>0$ and $K$ and $f$ are nonnegative nontrivial functions. If $K(r)\sim r^α$, $α>-2$, near $r=0$, $K(r)\sim r^β$, $β>-2$, near $r=\infty$ and certain assumptions on $f$ are imposed, then the problem has a unique positive radial singular solution for a certain range of $μ$. We show that existence of a positive radial singular solution is equivalent to existence of infinitely many positive bounded solutions which are not uniformly bounded, if $p$ is between the critical Sobolev exponent $p_S(α)$ and Joseph-Lundgren exponent $p_{JL}(α)$. Using these theorems, we establish existence of infinitely many positive bounded solutions which are not uniformly bounded, for $p_S(α)<p<p_{JL}(α)$ if $K(r)=r^{-α}$, $α>-2$."

We show that they can be nearly diagonalized as $k$-forms, generalizing a result of Graham-Lovász, implying a tensor version of ``conditional negative definiteness'', providing new proofs of previous results of the authors and Tauscheck, and resolving the conjecture that these hyperdeterminants depend only on $k$ and $n$ -- as Graham-Pollak showed for $k=2$. We conclude with some open questions."
2505.10486,Variational Seasonal-Trend Decomposition with Sparse Continuous-Domain Regularization,['math.FA'],['Julien Fageot'],"We consider the inverse problem of recovering a continuous-domain function from a finite number of noisy linear measurements. The unknown signal is modeled as the sum of a slowly varying trend and a periodic or quasi-periodic seasonal component. We formulate a variational framework for their joint recovery by introducing convex regularizations based on generalized total variation, which promote sparsity in spline-like representations. Our analysis is conducted in an infinite-dimensional setting and leads to a representer theorem showing that minimizers are splines in both components. To make the approach numerically feasible, we introduce a family of discrete approximations and prove their convergence to the original problem in the sense of $Γ$-convergence. This further ensures the uniform convergence of discrete solutions to their continuous counterparts. The proposed framework offers a principled approach to seasonal-trend decomposition in the presence of noise and limited measurements, with theoretical guarantees on both representation and discretization."

Weigandt showed that arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties, now called ASM varieties, are indexed by alternating sign matrices (ASMs), objects with a long history in enumerative combinatorics. It is very difficult to assess Cohen-Macaulayness of ASM varieties or to compute their codimension, though these properties are well understood for matrix Schubert varieties due to work of Fulton. In this paper we study these properties of ASM varieties with a focus on the relationship between a pair of ASMs and their direct sum. We also consider ASM pattern avoidance from an algebro-geometric perspective."
2505.10470,Separating balls with partly random hyperplanes with a view to partly random neural networks,['math.PR'],['Olov Schavemaker'],We derive exact expressions for the probabilities that partly random hyperplanes separate two Euclidean balls. The probability that a fully random hyperplane separates two balls turns out to be significantly smaller than the corresponding probabilities for hyperplanes which are not fully random in certain cases. Our results motivate studying partially random neural networks and provide a first step in this direction.
2505.10467,From Persistence to Resilience: New Betti Numbers for Analyzing Robustness in Simplicial Complex Networks,['math.AT'],"['Pablo Hernández-García', 'Daniel Hernández Serrano', 'Darío Sánchez Gómez']","Persistent homology is a fundamental tool in topological data analysis; however, it lacks methods to quantify the fragility or fineness of cycles, anticipate their formation or disappearance, or evaluate their stability beyond persistence. Furthermore, classical Betti numbers fail to capture key structural properties such as simplicial dimensions and higher-order adjacencies. In this work, we investigate the robustness of simplicial networks by analyzing cycle thickness and their resilience to failures or attacks. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from persistent homology to introduce filtrations that model distinct simplicial elimination rules, leading to the definition of two novel Betti number families: thick and cohesive Betti numbers. These improved invariants capture richer structural information, enabling the measurement of the thickness of the links in the homology cycle and the assessment of the strength of their connections. This enhances and refines classical topological descriptors and our approach provides deeper insights into the structural dynamics of simplicial complexes and establishes a theoretical framework for assessing robustness in higher-order networks. Finally, we establish that the resilience of topological features to simplicial attacks can be systematically examined through biparameter persistence modules, wherein one parameter encodes the progression of the attack, and the other captures structural refinements informed by thickness or cohesiveness."
2505.10458,Smooth surface systems may contain smooth curves which have no measure of maximal entropy,['math.DS'],"['Xulei Wang', 'Guohua Zhang']","In this paper, we study Borel probability measures of maximal entropy for analytic subsets in a dynamical system. It is well known that higher smoothness of the map over smooth space plays important role in the study of invariant measures of maximal entropy. A famous theorem of Newhouse states that smooth diffeomorphisms on compact manifolds without boundary have invariant measures of maximal entropy. However, we show that the situation becomes completely different when we study measures of maximal entropy for analytic subsets. Namely, we construct a smooth surface system which contains a smooth curve having no Borel probability measure of maximal entropy. Another evidence to show this difference is that, once an analytic set has one measure of maximal entropy, then the set has many measures of maximal entropy (no matter if we consider packing or Bowen entropy). For a general dynamical system with positive entropy $h_\mathrm{top}(T)$, we shall show that the system contains not only a Borel subset which has Borel probability measures of maximal entropy and has entropy sufficiently close to $h_\mathrm{top}(T)$, but also a Borel subset which has no Borel probability measures of maximal entropy and has entropy equal to the arbitrarily given positive real number which is at most $h_\mathrm{top}(T)$. We also provide in all $h$-expansive systems a full characterization for analytic subsets which have Borel probability measures of maximal entropy. Consequently, if let $Z\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be any analytic subset with positive Hausdorff dimension in Euclidean space, then the set $Z$ either has a measure of full lower Hausdorff dimension, or it can be partitioned into a union of countably many analytic sets $\{Z_i\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ with $\dim_{\mathcal{H}}(Z_i) < \dim_{\mathcal{H}}(Z)$ for each $i$."

Here, we present a more general framework to construct the attractor and the functions on the PCF self-similar sets using the Edelstein contraction, which broadens the class of functions. En route, we calculate the upper and lower box dimensions of the graph of non-linear interpolant. Finally, we provide several graphical and numerical examples for illustration of the construction and estimate the dimensions for different data sets."

This is accomplished by considering the center of a vertex algebra in Deligne's interpolating categories, along with Feigin's Lie algebras of complex rank, $\mathfrak{gl}_λ$ and $\mathfrak{po}_λ$. More precisely, we define the universal affine vertex algebras associated with Lie algebras in $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{GL}_α,\mathbb{F})$, $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{O}_α,\mathbb{F})$ and $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{Sp}_α,\mathbb{F})$, and describe their centers at the critical level explicitly by interpolating Molev's construction of Segal-Sugawara vectors. Using the formalism of Poisson vertex algebras, we identify a natural set of generators for the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of $\mathfrak{gl}_λ$ and $\mathfrak{po}_λ$, denoted by $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{gl}_λ)$ and $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{po}_λ)$, respectively. Finally, we show that the interpolated Feigin-Frenkel isomorphism maps the interpolated Segal-Sugawara vectors to these generators."

As a consequence, we prove that the singular cohomology of a proper toric variety is mixed of Hodge-Tate type. Additionally, using these Hodge module techniques, we derive a purely combinatorial result on rational polyhedral cones that has consequences regarding the depth of reflexive differentials on a toric variety.
  We then study in detail two important subclasses of toric varieties: those corresponding to cones over simplicial polytopes and those corresponding to cones over simple polytopes. Here, we give a comprehensive description of the local cohomology in terms of the combinatorics of the associated cones, and calculate the Betti numbers (or more precisely, the Hodge-Du Bois diamond) of a projective toric variety associated to a simple polytope."
2505.10404,A general regularization strategy for singular Stokes problems and convergence analysis for corresponding discretization and iterative solution,['math.NA'],"['Weizhang Huang', 'Zhuoran Wang']","A general regularization strategy is considered for the efficient iterative solution of the lowest-order weak Galerkin approximation of singular Stokes problems. The strategy adds a rank-one regularization term to the zero (2,2) block of the underlying singular saddle point system. This strategy includes the existing pressure pinning and mean-zero enforcement regularization as special examples. It is shown that the numerical error maintains the optimal-order convergence provided that the nonzero Dirichlet boundary datum is approximated numerically with sufficient accuracy. Inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners are considered for the regularized system. The convergence analysis for MINRES and GMRES with corresponding block preconditioners is provided for different choices of the regularization term. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are presented to verify the theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the preconditioning for solving the regularized system."

2505.10366,Arbitrarily Small Execution-Time Certificate: What was Missed in Analog Optimization,['math.OC'],"['Liang Wu', 'Ambrose Adegbege', 'Yongduan Song', 'Richard D. Braatz']","Numerical optimization (solving optimization problems using digital computers) currently dominates, but has three major drawbacks: high energy consumption, poor scalability, and lack of an execution time certificate. To address these challenges, this article explores the recent resurgence of analog computers, proposing a novel paradigm of arbitrarily small execution-time-certified analog optimization (solving optimization problems via analog computers). To achieve ultra-low energy consumption, this paradigm transforms optimization problems into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages the ability of analog computers to naturally solve ODEs (no need for time-discretization) in physically real time. However, this transformation can fail if the optimization problem, such as the general convex nonlinear programs (NLPs) considered in this article, has no feasible solution. To avoid transformation failure and enable infeasibility detection, this paradigm introduces the homogeneous monotone complementarity problem formulation for convex NLPs. To achieve scalability and execution time certificate, this paradigm introduces the Newton-based fixed-time-stable scheme for the transformed ODE, whose equilibrium time $T_p$ can be prescribed by choosing the ODE's time coefficient as $k=\fracπ{2T_p}$. This equation certifies that the equilibrium time (execution time) is independent of the dimension of optimization problems and can be arbitrarily small if the analog computer allows."
2505.10364,Topologies and sheaves on causal manifolds,['math.AG'],['Pierre Schapira'],"A causal manifold $(M,γ)$ is a manifold $M$ endowed with a closed proper cone $γ$ in the tangent bundle $TM$ such that the projection $TM\to M$ is surjective when restricted to the interior of $γ$. Let $λ$ be the antipodal of the polar cone of $γ$.
  An open set $U$ of $M$ is called $γ$-open if its Whitney normal cone contains the interior of $γ$. Similarly, $U$ is called $λ$-open if the micro-support of the constant sheaf on $U$ is contained in $λ$. We begin by proving that the two notions coincide.
  Next, we prove that if $(M,γ)$ admits a ``future time function'' the functor of direct images establishes an equivalence of triangulated categories between the derived category of sheaves on $M$ micro-supported by $λ$ and the derived category of sheaves on the manifold $M$ endowed with the $γ$-topology. This generalizes a result of~\cite{KS90} which dealt with the case of a constant cone in a vector space."

2505.10346,A ill-posed scattering problem saturating Weyl's law,['math.AP'],['T. Chaumont-Frelet'],"This paper focuses on the well-posedness (or lack thereof) of three-dimensional time-harmonic wave propagation problems modeled by the Helmholtz equation. It is well-known that if the problem is set in bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions, then the Helmholtz problem is well-posed for all (real-valued) frequencies except for a sequence of countably many resonant frequencies that accumulate at infinity. In fact, if the domain is sufficiently smooth, this can be quantified further and Weyl's law states that the number of resonant frequencies less than a given $ω> 0$ scales as $ω^3$. On the other hand, scattering problems set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a radiation condition at infinity and a bounded obstacle modeled by variations in the PDE coefficients are well-posed for all frequencies under mild regularity assumption on such coefficients. In 2001, Filinov provided a counter example of a rough coefficient such that the scattering problem is not well-posed for (at least) a single frequency $ω$. In this contribution, we use this result to show that for all $\varepsilon > 0$ we can design a rough coefficient corresponding to a compactly supported obstacle such that the scattering problem is ill-posed for a countable sequence of frequencies accumulating at infinity, and such that the number of such frequencies less than any given $ω> 0$ scales as $ω^{3-\varepsilon}$."

The parameter $Δ_{n,l}$ is defined as $$ Δ_{n,l}=\frac{1-\frac{3}{2^{2^l+2l-3}}}{1-\frac{1}{n2^{l-1}}}. $$ Specifically, by setting $l=2$, we achieve $Δ_{n,l}>3/4+5/32$, which surpasses the result obtained by Liu, Shparlinski, and Zhang (2018). Meanwhile, this has also improved upon the result of Wu and Xi (2021). Notably, Hooley, Linnik, and Selberg (1950's) independently established that the asymptotic formula holds for $q\leq X^{2/3-\varepsilon}$. Irving (2015) was the first to surpass the $2/3-$barrier for certain special moduli. We break the classical $3/4-$barrier in the case of prime power moduli and extend the range of $q$. Our main ingredients borrow from Mangerel's (2021) adaptation of Milićević and Zhang's methodology in dealing with a specific class of weighted Kloosterman sums, rather than adopting Korobov's technique employed by Liu, Shparlinski, and Zhang (2018)."

In this paper, we extend that line of work, in particular to the setting of infinite words. We present a dualised syntax, yielding a notation for APAs based on right-linear lattice expressions, and provide a natural axiomatisation of their equational theory with respect to the standard language model of ω-regular languages. The design of this axiomatisation is guided by the theory of fixed point logics; in fact, the completeness factors cleanly through the completeness of the linear-time μ-calculus."

Various numerical approaches have been proposed to compute geodesics, but so far elude a rigorous convergence theory. By a slick modification of a temporal Galerkin discretization we manage to preserve coercivity and compactness properties of the continuous model and thereby are able to prove convergence for the geodesic boundary value problem. Likewise, for the numerical analysis of the geodesic initial value problem we are able to exploit the geodesic completeness of the underlying continuous model for the error control of a time-stepping approximation. In fact, we develop a convergent discretization of a comprehensive Riemannian calculus that in addition includes parallel transport, covariant differentiation, the Riemann curvature tensor, and sectional curvature, all important tools to explore the geometry of the space of curves. Selected numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings and show the qualitative behaviour. To this end, a low-dimensional submanifold of Sobolev curves with explicit formulas for ground truth covariant derivatives and curvatures are considered."

We also prove that if a two-dimensional representation of $\text{Gal}(\bar L/L)$ appears in the locally $σ$-algebraic vectors of the completed cohomology then it is $σ$-de Rham. Finally, we give a geometric realization of some locally $σ$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(L)$. This realization has some applications to the $p$-adic local Langlands program, including a locality theorem for Galois representations arising from classical automorphic forms, an admissibility result for coherent cohomology of Drinfeld curves, and some special cases of the Breuil's locally analytic Ext$^1$-conjecture for $\mathrm{GL}_2(L)$."

In the present article, we turn to the effect of a natural graph-theoretic operation on associated ask zeta functions. Specifically, we show that two instances of rational functions, $W^-_Γ(X,T)$ and $W^\sharp_Γ(X,T)$, associated with a graph $Γ$ are both well-behaved under taking joins of graphs.

Under this perturbation, the system exhibits two conserved quantities: the volume and the energy. At the level of the hydrodynamic limit, under diffusive scaling, we show that depending on the strength of the Hamiltonian dynamics, energy and volume evolve according to either a system of autonomous heat equations or a non-linear system of coupled parabolic equations. Moreover, for general initial measures, under diffusive scaling, we can characterize the non-equilibrium volume fluctuations. The proofs are based on precise bounds on the two-point volume correlation function and a uniform fourth-moment estimate."

2505.10229,Strong and weak convergence rates for fully coupled multiscale stochastic differential equations driven by $α$-stable processes,['math.PR'],['Kun Yin'],"We first establish strong convergence rates for multiscale systems driven by $α$-stable processes, with analyses constructed in two distinct scaling regimes. When addressing weak convergence rates of this system, we derive four averaged equations with respect to four scaling regimes. Notably, under sufficient Hölder regularity conditions on the time-dependent drifts of slow process, the strong convergence orders are related to the known optimal strong convergence order $1-\frac{1}α$, and the weak convergence orders are 1. Our primary approach involves employing nonlocal Poisson equations to construct ``corrector equations"" that effectively eliminate inhomogeneous terms."
2505.10209,An Inverse Problem for Multi-Dimensional Piston Models with Large Velocity Variations,['math.AP'],"['Dian Hu', 'Qianfeng Li', 'Yongqian Zhang']","When a circular symmetric piston suddenly expands into a still gas, a leading shock wave is generated. This paper investigates an inverse problem of reconstructing the trajectory of the piston from the given leading shock front and the given initial flow conditions. We observe that in piston models, as the initial density goes to zero, the piston approaches the shock front; however, in the region between the piston and the shock front, the strict hyperbolicity of the system degenerates. By applying asymptotic analysis, we provide quantitative characterizations of the distance between the piston and the shock front, and the degeneration of strict hyperbolicity. Consequently, by designing appropriate a priori assumptions to balance the benefits and drawbacks arising as the initial density approaches zero, we employ the method of characteristics to prove the global-in-time existence of the piecewise smooth solution for this inverse problem. In particular, the resulting flow structure exhibits significant velocity variations."
2505.10193,Gauge transformations on quantum principal bundles,"['math.QA', 'math-ph', 'math.RA']","['Antonio Del Donno', 'Emanuele Latini', 'Thomas Weber']","We understand quantum principal bundle as faithfully flat Hopf--Galois extensions, with a structure Hopf algebra coacting on a total space algebra and with base algebra given by the coinvariant elements. To endow such bundles with a compatible differential structure, one requires the coaction to extend as a morphism of differential graded algebras. This leads to an exact noncommutative Atiyah sequence, a graded Hopf--Galois extension of differential forms and a canonical braiding on total space forms such that the latter are graded-braided commutative. We recall this approach to noncommutative differential geometry and further discuss the extension of quantum gauge transformations, in the sense of Brzeziński, to differential forms. In this way we obtain an action of quantum gauge transformations on connections of the quantum principal bundle and their curvature. Explicit examples, such as the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and smash product algebras are discussed."

Such functions will be called Luh hypercyclic vectors for the respective composition operator. We show that there is a dense linear manifold of Luh hypercyclic vectors. Moreover, we study the dynamics of cosine operator function generated by weighted composition operators on solid Banach function spaces, in particular on Orlicz and Morrey spaces, and we give sufficient conditions for supercyclicity of such cosine operator functions in terms of the corresponding weight function. Also, we give concrete examples of weighted translations satisfying these sufficient conditions."

This algorithm found many applications in problems of functional analysis, approximation theory, combinatorics, etc. In this paper we propose a modification of the invariant polytope algorithm enlarging the class of problems to which it is applicable. Precisely, we introduce mixed numeric and symbolic computations. A further minor modification of augmenting the input set with additional matrices speeds up the algorithm in certain cases. With this modifications we are able to automatically prove the finiteness conjecture for all pairs of binary $3\times 3$ matrices and sign $2\times 2$ matrices."

We provide two main characterizations: one via Korevaar-Schoen-type energy functionals and another via the heat kernel associated with the natural Dirichlet form. Applications include interpolation results for Besov-Lipschitz spaces, critical exponents computations, and a Nash inequality. In globally tree-like settings we also establish $L^p$ gradient bounds for the heat semigroup."

In particular, we show that $\mathrm{CP}(\mathbf{K},\ast)$ holds in the classes of free products of cyclic groups of fixed order, direct sums of a fixed torsion-free abelian group of rank 1 which is not $\mathbb{Q}$, (infinite) free $(k,n)$-Steiner systems, and (infinite) free generalised $n$-gons.

Differing from the existing works on the expected reward criteria, our concern here is to maximize the probabilities that the accumulated rewards until the first passage time to any target set exceed a given goal, which represent the reliability of the players income. Under a mild condition, by developing a comparison theorem for the probability criterion, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium over history-dependent policies. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm for computing epsilon-Nash equilibria. Finally, we illustrate our main results by a nonstationary energy management model and take a numerical experiment."

This result is key to completing previous partial results on existence or non-existence of infinite families of even sextic monogenic polynomials with a prescribed Galois group. Some of the underlying ideas are relevant for investigation of more general families of even polynomials $f(X^2)$, or power-compositional polynomials $f(X^\ell)$."

2505.10108,A generalized discontinuous Hamilton Monte Carlo for transdimensional sampling,['math.NA'],"['Lei Li', 'Xiangxian Luo', 'Yinchen Luo']","In this paper, we propose a discontinuous Hamilton Monte Carlo (DHMC) to sample from dimensional varying distributions, and particularly the grand canonical ensemble. The DHMC was proposed in [Biometrika, 107(2)] for discontinuous potential where the variable has a fixed dimension. When the dimension changes, there is no clear explanation of the volume-preserving property, and the conservation of energy is also not necessary. We use a random sampling for the extra dimensions, which corresponds to a measure transform. We show that when the energy is corrected suitably for the trans-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the detailed balance condition is then satisfied. For the grand canonical ensemble, such a procedure can be explained very naturally to be the extra free energy change brought by the newly added particles, which justifies the rationality of our approach. To sample the grand canonical ensemble for interacting particle systems, the DHMC is then combined with the random batch method to yield an efficient sampling method. In experiments, we show that the proposed DHMC combined with the random batch method generates samples with much less correlation when compared with the traditional Metropolis-Hastings method."

The evolution of the car density is described by a continuity equation where the drivers' velocity depends on both the empty road velocity and the convolution of the car density with an anisotropic kernel. We establish existence and uniqueness results. When the convolution kernel is replaced by a Dirac Delta, the nonlocal model formally boils down to the classical (local) Generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang model, which consists of a conservation law coupled with a transport equation. In the case of exponential kernels, we establish convergence in the nonlocal-to-local limit by proving an Oleinik-type estimate for the convolution term. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonlocal-to-local limit result for a system of two non-decoupling equations with a nonlocal flux function."

In this paper, we prove that odd Hadwiger's conjecture is true for the complements $\overline{K}(n,k)$ of the Kneser graphs $K(n,k)$, where $n\geq 2k \ge 4$. This improves a result of G. Xu and S. Zhou (2017) which states that Hadwiger's conjecture is true for this family of graphs. Moreover, we prove that $\overline{K}(n,k)$ contains a 1-shallow complete minor of a special type with order no less than the chromatic number $χ(\overline{K}(n,k))$, and in the case when $7 \le 2k+1 \le n \le 3k-1$ the gap between the odd Hadwiger number and chromatic number of $\overline{K}(n,k)$ is $Ω(1.5^{k})$."
2505.10095,Error Estimates and Graded Mesh Refinement for Isogeometric Analysis on Polar Domains with Corners,['math.NA'],"['Thomas Apel', 'Philipp Zilk']","Isogeometric analysis (IGA) enables exact representations of computational geometries and higher-order approximation of PDEs. In non-smooth domains, however, singularities near corners limit the effectiveness of IGA, since standard methods typically fail to achieve optimal convergence rates. These constraints can be addressed through local mesh refinement, but existing approaches require breaking the tensor-product structure of splines, which leads to increased implementation complexity.
  This work introduces a novel local refinement strategy based on a polar parameterization, in which one edge of the parametric square is collapsed into the corner. By grading the standard mesh toward the collapsing edge, the desired locality near the singularity is obtained while maintaining the tensor-product structure. A mathematical analysis and numerical tests show that the resulting isogeometric approximation achieves optimal convergence rates with suitable grading parameters.
  Polar parameterizations, however, suffer from a lack of regularity at the polar point, making existing standard isogeometric approximation theory inapplicable. To address this, a new framework is developed for deriving error estimates on polar domains with corners. This involves the construction of polar function spaces on the parametric domain and a modified projection operator onto the space of $C^0$-smooth polar splines. The theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach."

The Sombor index of $G$, $SO(G)$, is defined as $\sum_{uv\in E(G)} \sqrt{deg(u)^2 + deg(v)^2}$, where $deg(u)$ is the degree of vertex $u$ in $V (G)$. The clean graph of a ring R, denoted by $Cl(R)$, is a graph with vertex set $\{(e, u) : e \in Id(R), u \in U(R)\}$ and two distinct vertices $(e, u)$ and$(f, v)$ are adjacent if and only if $ef = 0$ or $uv = 1$ ($Id(R)$ and $U(R)$ are the sets of idempotents and unit elements of R, respectively). The induced subgraph on $\{(e, u) : e \in Id^{*}(R), u \in U(R)\}$ is denoted by $Cl_2(R)$. In this paper, $SO(Cl2(\mathbb{Z}_n))$, for different values of the positive integer $n$, is investigated."

We establish that, under certain conditions, quasi-similarity within the classes $\mathcal{F}_{n}(\mathcal{A})$ and $\mathcal{OF}_{n}(\mathcal{A})$ is equivalent, which provides an approach to describing quasi-similarity and similarity for high-index Fredholm operators. Furthermore, we demonstrate that quasi-similarity implies similarity for a large number of operators in $\mathcal{F}_{n}(\mathcal{A})$, thereby yielding a partial answer to the question raised by D.A. Herrero and generalizing existing numerous results. As applications, several examples of quasi-similarity and similarity involving multiplication operators on vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are presented. Lastly, we show that the strong irreducibility is preserved up to quasi-similarity within the class $\mathcal{F}_{n}(\mathcal{A})$. This offers a partial solution to C.L. Jiang's question."

The boundary conditions are of Dirichlet type on the basis of this structure and Neumann on the lateral boundary. We focus on the low frequencies. We study the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions, which are approached as $\varepsilon\to 0$ by those of a 1D model with Dirichlet boundary conditions, but which takes into account the geometry of the domain. Explicit and numerical computations enlighten the interest of this study, when the parameter becomes smaller. At the same time they show that in order to capture oscillations in the transverse direction we need to deal with the high frequencies. For prism like domains, we show the different asymptotic behavior of the spectrum depending on the boundary conditions."

To account for this new setting, we work directly on the equation satisfied by the controls of the MFG. Following previous works, we define an appropriate notion of solution under which uniqueness and stability results hold for solutions without any differentiability assumption with respect to probability measures. Thanks to those properties, we show the existence of a monotone solution to displacement monotone mean field games under local regularity assumptions on the coefficients and sufficiently strong monotonicity. Albeit they are not the focus of this article, results presented are also of interest for mean field games of control and general mean field forward backward systems. In order to account for this last setting, we use the notion of L2--monotonicity instead of displacement monotonicity, those two notions being equivalent in the particular case of MFG."

This paper proposes a globalized distributionally robust chance-constrained (GDRC) SVM model based on core sets to address uncertainties in the dataset and provide a robust classifier. The globalization means that we focus on the uncertainty in the sample population rather than the small perturbations around each sample point. The uncertainty is mainly specified by the confidence region of the first- and second-order moments. The core sets are constructed to capture some small regions near the potential classification hyperplane, which helps improve the classification quality via the expected distance constraint of the random vector to core sets. We obtain the equivalent semi-definite programming reformulation of the GDRC SVM model under some appropriate assumptions. To deal with the large-scale problem, an approximation approach based on principal component analysis is applied to the GDRC SVM. The numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of our model."

In this paper, we present an explicit formula for the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(R, R^{\times})$ for any finite ring $R$. However, our focus is on a more general case of the unitary Cayley graph. It is well known that the classical Ramanujan's sum represents the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(\mathbb{Z}_n, \mathbb{Z}_n^{\times})$. Consequently, the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(R, R^{\times})$ can be view as a generalization of classical Ramanujan's sum in the context of finite rings. Interestingly, the formula we derive for the eigenvalues of $\text{Cay}(R, R^{\times})$ extends the known formula of classical Ramanujan's sum to the context of finite rings."

Combined with the algorithms of the first author or Hazeltine-Liu-Lo for detecting Arthur type representations, our result leads to an explicit algorithm for checking the unitarity of any given irreducible representation of good parity.

In particular, we show that every such matrix can be written as either a sum or a product of two diagonalizable matrices. The number $2$ is not valid under mild conditions on the center, similar to those in Botha's work on fields. By applying this result and other results obtained so far, we latter establish some Waring-type results for matrices."

The ``nodal curves'' boundary is an (orbifold) simple normal crossings divisor, and is conjecturally anticanonical. Its dual simplicial complex is the order complex of the open Bruhat interval $(λ,μ) \subseteq W/W_P$, shown in [Björner-Wachs '82] to be a sphere or ball.

2505.09898,A Topological and Operator Algebraic Framework for Asynchronous Lattice Dynamical Systems,['math.GM'],['Faruk Alpay'],"I introduce a novel mathematical framework integrating topological dynamics, operator algebras, and ergodic geometry to study lattices of asynchronous metric dynamical systems. Each node in the lattice carries an internal flow represented by a one-parameter family of operators, evolving on its own time scale. I formalize stratified state spaces capturing multiple levels of synchronized behavior, define an asynchronous evolution metric that quantifies phase-offset distances between subsystems, and characterize emergent coherent topologies arising when subsystems synchronize. Within this framework, I develop formal operators for the evolution of each subsystem and give precise conditions under which phase-aligned synchronization occurs across the lattice. The main results include: (1) the existence and uniqueness of coherent (synchronized) states under a contractive coupling condition, (2) stability of these coherent states and criteria for their emergence as a collective phase transition in a continuous operator topology, and (3) the influence of symmetries, with group-invariant coupling leading to flow-invariant synchrony subspaces and structured cluster dynamics. Proofs are given for each theorem, demonstrating full mathematical rigor. In a final section, I discuss hypothetical applications of this framework to symbolic lattice systems (e.g. subshifts), to invariant group actions on dynamical lattices, and to operator fields over stratified manifolds in the spirit of noncommutative geometry. Throughout, I write in the first person to emphasize the exploratory nature of this work. The paper avoids any reference to cosmology or observers, focusing instead on clean, formal mathematics suitable for a broad array of dynamical systems."

2505.09886,Adaptive Open-Loop Step-Sizes for Accelerated Convergence Rates of the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm,['math.OC'],"['Elias Wirth', 'Javier Peña', 'Sebastian Pokutta']","Recent work has shown that in certain settings, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) with open-loop step-sizes $η_t = \frac{\ell}{t+\ell}$ for a fixed parameter $\ell \in \mathbb{N},\, \ell \geq 2$, attains a convergence rate faster than the traditional $O(t^{-1})$ rate. In particular, when a strong growth property holds, the convergence rate attainable with open-loop step-sizes $η_t = \frac{\ell}{t+\ell}$ is $O(t^{-\ell})$. In this setting there is no single value of the parameter $\ell$ that prevails as superior. This paper shows that FW with log-adaptive open-loop step-sizes $η_t = \frac{2+\log(t+1)}{t+2+\log(t+1)}$ attains a convergence rate that is at least as fast as that attainable with fixed-parameter open-loop step-sizes $η_t = \frac{\ell}{t+\ell}$ for any value of $\ell \in \mathbb{N},\,\ell\geq 2$. To establish our main convergence results, we extend our previous affine-invariant accelerated convergence results for FW to more general open-loop step-sizes of the form $η_t = g(t)/(t+g(t))$, where $g:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is any non-decreasing function such that the sequence of step-sizes $(η_t)$ is non-increasing. This covers in particular the fixed-parameter case by choosing $g(t) = \ell$ and the log-adaptive case by choosing $g(t) = 2+ \log(t+1)$. To facilitate adoption of log-adaptive open-loop step-sizes, we have incorporated this rule into the {\tt FrankWolfe.jl} software package."

Here $x$ is an indeterminate, thus allowing specialization to numerical congruences where $x$ takes certain algebraic numbers as values. We employ two different approaches that have complementary strengths.

Additionally, we prove a density version of spherical avoidance problems, which generalize from pairwise avoidance to broader configurations with prescribed pairwise inner products.

We improve on this by showing that graphs of cliquewidth $k$ admit a partition with `local, but dense' parts whose quotient has treewidth $k-1$. Specifically, each part is contained within the closed neighbourhood of some vertex. We use this to construct a $3$-quasi-isometry between graphs of cliquewidth $k$ and graphs of treewidth $k-1$. This is an improvement in both the quasi-isometry parameter and the treewidth. We also show that the bound on the treewidth is tight up to an additive constant."

We prove algebraically the $γ$-positivity of those refinements and give a combinatorial proof in a special case through the type B analog of noncrossing partitions. Then we introduce their natural $q$-analogs, prove their $q$-$γ$-positivity and prove some identities they satisfy, generalizing identities of Kreweras and Le Jen-Shoo. Using yet another identity, we prove that these refinements are positive integer polynomials in $q$."

The continuous space-time optimal control problem is transcribed into a sparse nonlinear programming problem through state and control parameterization. In particular, a multi-interval flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method is implemented for temporal discretization alongside a Galerkin finite element spatial discretization. The finite element discretization allows for a reduction in problem size and avoids the redefinition of constraints required under a previous method. Further, a generalization of a Kirchoff transformation is performed to handle variational form nonlinearities in the context of numerical optimization. Due to the correspondence between the collocation points and the applied boundary conditions, the multi-interval flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method is demonstrated to be preferable over the standard Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method for optimal control problems governed by parabolic partial differential equations. The details of the resulting transcription of the optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming problem are provided. Lastly, numerical examples demonstrate that the use of a multi-interval flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau temporal discretization can lead to a reduction in the required number of collocation points to compute accurate values of the optimal objective in comparison to other methods."

In fact, this minimum degree condition forces every orientation of a cycle in $G$ of every possible length, other than perhaps the directed cycles."

Burkhart', 'Colton J. Ross', 'Arshid Mir', 'Harold M. Burkhart', 'Chung-Hao Lee', 'Ming-Chen Hsu', 'Aishwarya Pawar']","Patient-specific computational modeling of the tricuspid valve (TV) is vital for the clinical assessment of heart valve diseases. However, this process is hindered by limitations inherent in the medical image data, such as noise and sparsity, as well as by complex valve dynamics. We present VALVEFIT, a novel GPU-accelerated and differentiable B-spline surface fitting framework that enables rapid reconstruction of smooth, analysis-suitable geometry from point clouds obtained via medical image segmentation. We start with an idealized TV B-spline template surface and optimize its control point positions to fit segmented point clouds via an innovative loss function, balancing shape fidelity and mesh regularization. Novel regularization terms are introduced to ensure that the surface remains smooth, regular, and intersection-free during large deformations. We demonstrate the robustness and validate the accuracy of the framework by first applying it to simulation-derived point clouds that serve as the ground truth. We further show its robustness across different point cloud densities and noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the framework toward fitting point clouds obtained from real patients at different stages of valve motion. An isogeometric biomechanical valve simulation is then performed on the fitted surfaces to show their direct applicability toward analysis. VALVEFIT enables automated patient-specific modeling with minimal manual intervention, paving the way for the future development of direct image-to-analysis platforms for clinical applications."
2505.09778,Regularized Operator Extrapolation Method For Stochastic Bilevel Variational Inequality Problems,['math.OC'],"['Mohammad Khalafi', 'Digvijay Boob']","The bilevel variational inequality (BVI) problem is a general model that captures various optimization problems, including VI-constrained optimization and equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints (EPECs).
  This paper introduces a first-order method for smooth or nonsmooth BVI with stochastic monotone operators at inner and outer levels. Our novel method, called Regularized Operator Extrapolation $(\texttt{R-OpEx})$, is a single-loop algorithm that combines Tikhonov's regularization with operator extrapolation. This method needs only one operator evaluation for each operator per iteration and tracks one sequence of iterates. We show that $\texttt{R-OpEx}$ gives $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ complexity in nonsmooth stochastic monotone BVI, where $ε$ is the error in the inner and outer levels. Using a mini-batching scheme, we improve the outer level complexity to $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$ while maintaining the $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4})$ complexity in the inner level when the inner level is smooth and stochastic. Moreover, if the inner level is smooth and deterministic, we show complexity of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$. Finally, in case the outer level is strongly monotone, we improve to $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-4/5})$ for general BVI and $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2/3})$ when the inner level is smooth and deterministic. To our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates nonsmooth stochastic BVI with the best-known convergence guarantees. We verify our theoretical results with numerical experiments."

Accuracy is validated against high-precision Maple calculations, and benchmarking shows execution time reductions to 54%-80% of Algorithm 644 (in double precision). Quad precision enhances numerical stability and broadens the domain of computations, making the implementation well suited for high-precision applications in physics and engineering.

2505.09766,On the Well-Posedness of Green's Function Reconstruction via the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz Equation for One-Speed Neutron Diffusion,"['math.NA', 'cs.AI']",['Roberto Ponciroli'],"This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex, heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its predictions."
2505.09765,Connections between convex optimization algorithms and subspace correction methods,"['math.OC', 'math.NA']","['Boou Jiang', 'Jongho Park', 'Jinchao Xu']","We show that a broad range of convex optimization algorithms, including alternating projection, operator splitting, and multiplier methods, can be systematically derived from the framework of subspace correction methods via convex duality. To formalize this connection, we introduce the notion of dualization, a process that transforms an iterative method for the dual problem into an equivalent method for the primal problem. This concept establishes new connections across these algorithmic classes, encompassing both well-known and new methods. In particular, we show that classical algorithms such as the von Neumann, Dykstra, Peaceman--Rachford, and Douglas--Rachford methods can be interpreted as dualizations of subspace correction methods applied to appropriate dual formulations. Beyond unifying existing methods, our framework enables the systematic development of new algorithms for convex optimization. For instance, we derive parallel variants of alternating projection and operator splitting methods, as dualizations of parallel subspace correction methods, that are well-suited for large-scale problems on modern computing architectures and offer straightforward convergence guarantees. We also propose new alternating direction method of multipliers-type algorithms, derived as dualizations of certain operator splitting methods. These algorithms naturally ensure convergence even in the multi-block setting, where the conventional method does not guarantee convergence when applied to more than two blocks. This unified perspective not only facilitates algorithm design and the transfer of theoretical results but also opens new avenues for research and innovation in convex optimization."

We show that any taut filling arises from an extension of $σ$ to a shellable simplicial triangulation of the 3-ball. The key to the proof is the general fact that any taut filling of an $n$-cycle splits under disjoint union, connected sum, and more generally what we call almost disjoint union, where summands are supported on sets that overlap in at most $n+1$ vertices. Despite the generality of this result, we have nothing to say about optimal fillings of spheres of dimension 3 or higher."

While the asymptotic scaling is nearly optimal, its performance on parallel architectures is dominated by the global communication required for the underlying fast Fourier transform (FFT). Here, we develop a novel method, ESP - Ewald summation with prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) - that, for a fixed precision, sharply reduces the size of this transform by performing the Ewald split via a PSWF. In addition, PSWFs minimize the cost of spreading and interpolation steps that move information between the particles and the underlying uniform grid. We have integrated the ESP method into two widely-used open-source MD packages: LAMMPS and GROMACS. Detailed benchmarks show that this reduces the cost of computing far-field electrostatic interactions by an order of magnitude, leading to better strong scaling with respect to number of cores. The total execution time is reduced by a factor of 2 to 3 when using more than one thousand cores, even after optimally tuning the existing internal parameters in the native codes. We validate the accelerated codes in realistic long-time biological simulations."

Furthermore, we apply our results to show that symbolic powers of a toric ideal can also be expressed as saturations of regular powers with the monomial given by the product of all the variables. Finally, we conclude with a computationally significant result for computing symbolic powers of toric ideals."
2505.09681,Failure of the measure contraction property via quotients in higher-step sub-Riemannian structures,"['math.DG', 'math.MG', 'math.OC']","['Samuël Borza', 'Luca Rizzi']","We prove that the synthetic Ricci curvature lower bound known as the measure contraction property (MCP) can fail in sub-Riemannian geometry. This may happen beyond step two, if the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, and it already occurs in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.
  Central to our analysis are new results, of independent interest, on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.
  As an application, we find sub-Riemannian structures with pre-medium-fat distribution that do not satisfy the MCP, answering a question raised in [L. Rifford, J. Éc. polytech. Math. 2023]. Finally, and quite unexpectedly, we show that ideal sub-Riemannian structures can fail the MCP, and this actually happens generically for rank greater than 3 and high dimension."

2505.09645,A Tauberian approach to the orthorecursive expansion of unity,['math.NT'],['Benoit Cloitre'],"We establish a Tauberian theorem connecting the unknown asymptotic behavior of the partial sums $\sum_{n\le x}a_{n}$ to the known asymptotics of weighted sums $\sum_{n\le x}a_{n}g(n/x)$, as $x\rightarrow\infty$, where $g:(0,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ is a given function. Our approach relies on an identity relating a modified Mellin transform of $g$ to the Dirichlet series $\sum_{n\ge1}a_{n}n^{-s}$. As an application, we solve an open problem posed by Kalmynin and Kosenko regarding the ""orthorecursive expansion of unity"" associated with a sequence $(c_{n})_{n\geq0}$. Specifically, we improve their partial-sum bound $C_{N}=\sum_{0\leq n\leq N}c_{n}=\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$, by obtaining the optimal estimate $C_{N}=\mathcal{O}(N^{-α_{1}+ε})$, where $α_{1}\approx1.3465165$ is the smallest real part among the zeros of a transcendental function related to the digamma function."

We begin with cardinal and ordinal numbers, examining deep questions such as the continuum hypothesis, along with foundational results such as the Schröder-Bernstein theorem, multiple proofs of the well-ordering of cardinals, and various properties of infinite cardinals and ordinals. Transitioning to algebra, we analyze the interplay between finite and infinite algebraic structures, including groups, rings, and $R$-modules. Major results, such as the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, Krull's Theorem, Hilbert's basis theorem, and the equivalence of free and projective modules over principal ideal domains, highlight the connections and differences between finite and infinite structures, as well as demonstrating the relationship between set-theoretic and algebraic treatments of infinity.

2505.09609,Robust Representation and Estimation of Barycenters and Modes of Probability Measures on Metric Spaces,"['math.ST', 'math.MG', 'stat.ME']","['Washington Mio', 'Tom Needham']","This paper is concerned with the problem of defining and estimating statistics for distributions on spaces such as Riemannian manifolds and more general metric spaces. The challenge comes, in part, from the fact that statistics such as means and modes may be unstable: for example, a small perturbation to a distribution can lead to a large change in Fréchet means on spaces as simple as a circle. We address this issue by introducing a new merge tree representation of barycenters called the barycentric merge tree (BMT), which takes the form of a measured metric graph and summarizes features of the distribution in a multiscale manner. Modes are treated as special cases of barycenters through diffusion distances. In contrast to the properties of classical means and modes, we prove that BMTs are stable -- this is quantified as a Lipschitz estimate involving optimal transport metrics. This stability allows us to derive a consistency result for approximating BMTs from empirical measures, with explicit convergence rates. We also give a provably accurate method for discretely approximating the BMT construction and use this to provide numerical examples for distributions on spheres and shape spaces."
2505.09604,"Exceptional force, uncountably many solutions in the KPZ fixed point",['math.PR'],"['Sudeshna Bhattacharjee', 'Ofer Busani', 'Evan Sorensen']","We give a complete characterization of all eternal solutions $b(x,t)$ of the KPZ fixed point satisfying the asymptotic slope condition $\lim_{|x| \to \infty} \frac{b(x,0)}{x} = 2ξ$. For fixed $ξ$, there is exactly one eternal solution with probability one. However, in the second and third authors' work with Seppäläinen, it was shown that there exists a random, countably infinite set of slopes, for which there exist at least two eternal solutions. These correspond to two non-coalescing families of infinite geodesics in the same direction for the directed landscape. We denote the two eternal solutions as $b^{ξ-}$ and $b^{ξ+}$. In the present paper, we show that, for the exceptional slopes, there are in fact uncountably many eternal solutions. To give the characterization, we show that these eternal solutions are in bijection with a certain set of bi-infinite competition interfaces. Each bi-infinite interface separates the plane into two connected components -- a left component and a right component. A general eternal solution with slope $ξ$ is equal to $b^{ξ-}$ on the left component and equal to $b^{ξ+}$ on the right component. For these bi-infinite interfaces in the exceptional directions, we uncover new geometric phenomena that is not present for directed landscape geodesics. Additionally, we show that this set of eternal solutions appears as the Busemann limits $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf {v_n};\mathbf {p}) - \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{v_n};\mathbf {q})$ for sequences $\mathbf {v_n}$ going to $-\infty$ in direction $ξ$."
2505.09589,Galois groups of simple abelian varieties over finite fields and exceptional Tate classes,"['math.NT', 'math.AG']","['Santiago Arango-Piñeros', 'Sam Frengley', 'Sameera Vemulapalli']","We prove new cases of the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties over finite fields, extending previous results of Dupuy--Kedlaya--Zureick-Brown, Lenstra--Zarhin, Tankeev, and Zarhin. Notably, our methods allow us to prove the Tate conjecture in cases when the angle rank is non-maximal.
  Our primary tool is a precise combinatorial condition which, given a geometrically simple abelian variety $A/\mathbf{F}_q$ with commutative endomorphism algebra, describes whether $A$ has exceptional classes (i.e., $\mathrm{Gal}( \bar{\mathbf{F}}_q/\mathbf{F}_q)$-invariant classes in $H_{\text{ét}}^{2r}(A_{\bar{\mathbf{F}}_q}, \mathbf{Q}_\ell(r))$ not contained in the span of classes of intersections of divisors). The criterion depends only on the Galois group of the minimal polynomial of Frobenius and its action on the Newton polygon of $A$.
  Our tools provide substantial control over the isogeny invariants of $A$, allowing us to prove a number of new results. Firstly, we provide an algorithm which, given a Newton polygon and CM field, determines if they arise from a geometrically simple abelian variety $A/\mathbf{F}_q$ and, if so, outputs one such $A$. As a consequence we show that every CM field occurs as the center of the endomorphism algebra of an abelian variety $A/\mathbf{F}_q$. Secondly, we refine a result of Tankeev and Dupuy--Kedlaya--Zureick-Brown on angle ranks of abelian varieties. In particular, we show that ordinary geometrically simple varieties of prime dimension have maximal angle rank."

That is, for certain valuations $\operatorname{val}_{v}$, we have $\operatorname{val}_v(\sum_u c_u \vartheta_u)=\min_{c_u\neq 0} \operatorname{val}_v(\vartheta_u)$. As applications, we prove linear independence of theta functions with specialized coefficients and characterize when theta functions for cluster varieties are unchanged by the unfreezing of an index. This yields a general gluing result for theta functions from moduli of local systems on marked surfaces. We then prove that theta functions for cluster varieties satisfy a symmetry property called theta reciprocity: briefly, $\operatorname{val}_v(\vartheta_u)=\operatorname{val}_u(\vartheta_v)$. For this we utilize a new framework called a ""seed datum"" for understanding cluster-type varieties. One may apply valuative independence and theta reciprocity together to identify theta function bases for global sections of line bundles on partial compactifications of cluster varieties."

This is a generalization of a result of McMullen to higher dimensions for equilibrium states. We use an approach developed by the author using a family of nonstationary transfer operators for an expanding skew product. We also apply a Markov partition argument to classify invariant probability measures for expanding maps on $\mathbb{T}^n$.

We prove the existence of the topological attractor and the existence of the invariant attracting measure for the Markov Process. We also prove that the support of the invariant measure is given by the attractor and results on the stochastic stability of the invariant measures, with respect to changes in the family $q_x$."

Our approach relies crucially on a novel cancellation mechanism dealing with the pathological case of energy-absorbing collisions (that is, collisions that accumulate energy to only one of the outgoing particles). This difficulty is specific to hard potentials, and is not present for Maxwell molecules. Our method quantifies the heuristic that, while energy-absorbing collisions occur with non-trivial probability, they are statistically rare, and therefore do not affect the overall averaging behavior of the gain operator. At the technical level, our proof relies solely on tools from kinetic theory, such as geometric identities and angular averaging."

The examples are motivated by Ruan's early example of deformation inequivalent symplectic forms in dimension $6$ distinguished by Gromov-Witten invariants. To find cohomologous symplectic forms and compare their Gromov width, we make use of Li-Liu's theorem of symplectic cone for manifolds with $b_2^+=1$ and Biran's ball packing theorem in dimension $4$. Along the way, we also show that these cohomologous symplectic forms can have distinct first Chern classes, which answers another question by Salamon."

Specifically, we prove the following inequality: $$ω_p(E,g_E) \leq \left( \sup_{b \in B} \operatorname{vol}_{g_E}(π^{-1}(b)) \right) ω_p(B,g_B). $$ Furthermore, we extend this result to the phase transition spectrum. In addition, we also obtain lower bounds for the isoperimetric profile of Riemannian fibrations with totally geodesic, spherical fibers in terms of the isoperimetric profile of the product of the base and a sphere. By exploiting connections between volume spectrum, least area minimal surfaces, and the isoperimetric profile, we employ these bounds to compute the low widths of Berger spheres and product of spheres. Notably, our analysis reveals that for sufficiently small $τ$, the equatorial sphere $S^2$ in the Berger sphere $S^3_τ$ (a $S^1-$bundle over $S^2(\frac{1}{2})$ with fiber length $2πτ$) attains the Simon-Smith $1,2,3,4$ widths but fails to attain any lower widths, in both the Almgren-Pitts setting and the Allen-Cahn setting."

Our main results are: (i) the constant-term morphism, which sends an almost-holomorphic modular form to its associated quasimodular form, is an isomorphism, (ii) description of spaces of quasimodular forms in terms of vector-valued modular forms, (iii) the lowering and raising operators satisfy equivariance properties with the theta lift, (iv) a weight-depth inequality which is a necessary and sufficient criterion for the theta lift of an almost-holomorphic modular form to be almost-holomorphic, (v) an explicit formula for the series expansion of the lift of any almost-holomorphic modular form, (vi) the Fourier-Jacobi coefficients of an orthogonal quasimodular form are quasi-Jacobi forms.
  As a geometric application, we conjecture that the Gromov-Witten potentials of Enriques and bielliptic surfaces are orthogonal quasimodular forms and satisfy holomorphic anomaly equations with respect to the lowering operators on quasimodular forms.

Our resolution analysis demonstrates that these imaging functions have a contrast when sampling points are near or far from the boundary of the obstacle.

Both methods combine dynamic smoothing with a momentum-based variance reduction scheme in a fully online manner. When \( h \) is Lipschitz continuous, we propose an stochastic algorithm under adaptive parameter that achieves the optimal iteration complexity of \( \mathcal{O}(ε^{-3}) \), improving upon the best-known rates for exist algorithms. When \( h \) is the indicator function of a convex set, we design a new algorithm using truncated momentum, and under a mild error bound condition with parameter \( θ\geq 1 \), we establish a complexity of \( \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(ε^{-\max\{θ+2, 2θ\}}) \), in line with the best-known results in the Euclidean setting. Both algorithms feature a single-loop design with low per-iteration cost and require only \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) samples per iteration, ensuring that sample and iteration complexities coincide.

Phase-field surfactant model with moving contact lines (PFS-MCL) has been employed to investigate the complex droplet dynamics with surfactants, while its numerical simulation remains challenging due to the coupling of gradient flows with respect to transport distances involving nonlinear and degenerate mobilities. We propose a novel structure-preserving variational scheme for PFS-MCL model with the dynamic boundary condition based on the minimizing movement scheme and optimal transport theory for Wasserstein gradient flows. The proposed scheme consists of a series of convex minimization problems and can be efficiently solved by our proposed primal-dual splitting method and its accelerated versions. By respecting the underlying PDE's variational structure with respect to the transport distance, the proposed scheme is proved to inherits the desirable properties including original energy dissipation, bound-preserving, and mass conservation. Through a suite of numerical simulations, we validate the performance of the proposed scheme and investigate the effects of surfactants on the droplet dynamics."

Extending Freeman filtration to the pre-Kähler setting, we define holomorphic degeneration and finite-nondegeneracy and show that the symmetry algebra of a real analytic pre-Kähler structure is finite-dimensional if and only if it is finitely nondegenerate. Concurrently, we extend the classical correspondence between Kähler and Sasakian structures to the pre-Kähler setting, i.e. a one-to-one (local) correspondence between $k$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces equipped with a transverse infinitesimal symmetry and $k$-nondegenerate pre-Kähler structures. We additionally formalize a second relationship between the categories, constructing a natural $k$-nondegenerate pre-Kähler structure defined on a line bundle over such CR structures via pre-symplectification.
  Focusing on the lowest dimensional case, we solve the equivalence problem of non-Kähler pre-Kähler complex surfaces that are 2-nondegenerate by associating a Cartan geometry to them and explicitly express their local invariants in terms of the fifth jet of a potential function. We describe the vanishing of their basic invariants in terms of a double fibration, which gives a pre-Kähler characterization of the twistor bundle of symplectic connections on surfaces. Lastly, our study of pre-Kähler complex surfaces that are symmetry reductions of homogeneous 2-nondegenerate CR 5-manifolds leads to a characterization of certain critical symplectic connections on surfaces and shows locally homogeneous 2-nondegenerate pre-Kähler complex surfaces are flat."

We show that this bound is sharp in all dimensions at least 2. In particular, this provides a new and self-contained proof that a Kakeya set in dimension 2 has size at least $q^2/2$ (which is asymptotically sharp). We also establish analogous results for sets containing $k$-planes in a given set of orientations."

While in previous results the weight sequence $\boldsymbol{M}$ of positive numbers is supposed to be derivation closed, a much weaker condition is shown to be sufficient to obtain the result in the case of Roumieu classes. Regarding Beurling classes, we are able to slightly improve a classical result of J. Schmets and M. Valdivia and reprove a result of A. Debrouwere, both under derivation closedness. Our new condition also allows us to obtain surjectivity results for Beurling classes in suitably small sectors, but the technique is now adapted from a classical procedure already appearing in the work of V. Thilliez, in its turn inspired by that of J. Chaumat and A.-M. Chollet."

We sample $N_K$ individuals distributed evenly across the $d$ colonies and trace their ancestral lineages back. Within a colony, we assume that pairs of ancestral lineages coalesce at a constant rate, as in a Kingman's coalescent. We identify each ancestral lineage with the set, or block, of its descendants in the sample and we encode the state of the system using a $d$-dimensional vector of empirical measures; the $i$-th component records the blocks present in colony $i$ and the initial location of the lineages composing each block. We are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of the process of empirical measures as $K\to\infty$. We consider two regimes: the critical sampling regime, where $N_K \sim K$ and the large sampling regime where $N_K \gg K$. After an appropriate time-space scaling, we show that the process of empirical measures converges to the solution of a $d$-dimensional coagulation equation. In the critical sampling regime, the solution can be represented in terms of a multi-type branching process. In the large sampling regime, the solution can be represented in terms of the entrance law of a multi-type continuous state branching process."

The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has emerged as a preferred first-order approach due to its iteration efficiency - exemplified by the state-of-the-art OSQP solver. Machine learning-enhanced optimization algorithms have recently demonstrated significant success in speeding up the solving process. This work introduces a neural-accelerated ADMM variant that replaces exact subproblem solutions with learned approximations through a parameter-efficient Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. We derive convergence guarantees within the inexact ADMM formalism, establishing that our learning-augmented method maintains primal-dual convergence while satisfying residual thresholds. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior solution accuracy compared to existing learning-based methods while delivering significant computational speedups of up to $7\times$, $28\times$, and $22\times$ over Gurobi, SCS, and OSQP, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms other learning-to-optimize methods in terms of solution quality. Detailed performance analysis confirms near-perfect compliance with the theoretical assumptions, consequently ensuring algorithm convergence."

This paper aims to study a deformation and quantization of this isomorphism. We show that if $A$ is a Koszul Calabi-Yau algebra, then the primitive part of the Lie algebra homology $\mathrm{H}_\bullet (\mathfrak{gl}(A))$ has a Lie bialgebra structure which is induced from the Poincaré duality of $A$ and deforms $\mathrm{H}_\bullet (\mathfrak{gl}(A))$ to a co-Poisson bialgebra. Moreover, there is a Hopf algebra which quantizes such a co-Poisson bialgebra, and the Loday-Quillen-Tsygan isomorphism lifts to the quantum level, which can be interpreted as a quantization of the tangent map from the tangent complex of $\mathrm{BGL}$ to the tangent complex of K-theory."

The objective of safe optimization is to solve a black-box minimization problem while strictly adhering to a safety constraint throughout the learning process. Existing methods often suffer from high sample complexity due to their noise sensitivity or poor scalability with number of dimensions, limiting their applicability. We propose a novel primal-dual optimization method that, by carefully adjusting dual step-sizes and constraining primal updates, ensures the safety of both primal and dual sequences throughout the optimization. Our algorithm achieves a convergence rate that significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first primal-dual approach to guarantee safe updates. Simulations corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the practical benefits of our method. We also show how the method can be extended to multiple constraints."

To do so, we impose a smallness condition on the difference $u_0-b_0$. Then we use this result to prove magnetic reconnection for a suitable class of (large) solutions. With this, we mean a change of topology of the integral lines of the magnetic field $b$ under the evolution. The proof relies on counting the number of hyperbolic critical points of the solutions, and this instance is structurally stable."

We introduce the stochastic next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) controller, a framework that integrates the computational efficiency of NG-RC with stochastic analysis to enable robust event-triggered control in multiscale stochastic systems. The asymptotic stability of the controller is rigorously proven via an extended stochastic LaSalle theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for amplitude regulation in nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments on a stochastic Van-der-Pol system subject to both additive and multiplicative noise validate the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence rate across varying temporal scales and noise intensities. To bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications, we deploy the controller to modulate pathological dynamics reconstructed from epileptic EEG data. This work advances a theoretically guaranteed scalable framework for adaptive control of stochastic systems, with broad potential for data-driven decision making in engineering, neuroscience, and beyond."

This is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived \textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and $3.6\times$ the performance of PyTorch.

We then show that these solutions are Sobolev differentiable with respect to their initial conditions and provide an explicit representation involving integrals with respect to the local time of the state process. We handle the irregular drift, by constructing a sequence of approximating control problems with smooth coefficients. By applying Ekeland's variational principle, we obtain a sequence of adjoint processes, which we then use to derive the maximum principle by taking the limit."

We show that a semigroup with a completely simple ideal is solvable (left nilpotent or right nilpotent or supernilpotent) in the sense of commutator theory iff it is a nilpotent extension in the classical sense of semigroup theory of a completely simple semigroup with solvable (nilpotent) subgroups. These characterizations hold in particular for finite semigroups and for eventually regular semigroups, i.e., semigroups in which every element has some regular power.

We introduce the concept of pluri-quasibounded functions on $Ω$ and $\partial Ω$, defined by the existence of plurisuperharmonic majorants that dominate their absolute value in a strong sense - that is, the ratio of the function to the majorant tends to zero as the function tends to infinity. For such data, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions in the Blocki--Cegrell class $\mathcal{D}(Ω)$, using a recently established comparison principle. In the unit disk, our approach recovers harmonic functions represented as Poisson integrals of $L^1$ boundary data with respect to harmonic measure, and our characterization extends to all regular domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$, when the boundary data is continuous almost everywhere. We also describe how boundary singularities propagate into the interior via a refined pluripolar hull."

The main difficulties come from slow decay and non-homogeneity of the Fourier multiplier $(\sqrt{\tanh ξ/ξ})ξ$, which will be overcome by introducing an interaction multiplier theorem and estimating the weighted norms in the frequency space. When estimating the weighted norms, due to loss of derivatives, the energy estimate will be performed in the frequency space, and the absence of time resonance will be effectively utilized by extracting some good terms arising from integration by parts in time before the energy estimate."

However, recent research shows that the heavy-tailed noise, which allows an unbounded variance, is closer to practical scenarios in many tasks. Under heavy-tailed noise, traditional optimization methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, may have poor performance and even diverge. Thus, it is of great importance to study distributed stochastic optimization algorithms applicable to the heavy-tailed noise scenario. However, most of the existing distributed algorithms under heavy-tailed noise are developed for convex and smooth problems, which limits their applications. This paper proposes a clipping-based distributed stochastic algorithm under heavy-tailed noise that is suitable for non-smooth and weakly convex problems. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proven, and the conditions on the parameters are given. A numerical experiment is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

These polynomials are a generalization of Schur polynomials and enumerate down-arrowed monotone triangles, and thus also alternating sign matrices.

For short-range potentials, we establish an optimal time-decay estimate in weighted $L^2$-spaces when $ n\ge 5$ is odd. For potentials decaying like $O(|x|^{-ρ})$ for some $ρ> n-1$, we obtain, for all dimensions $n \ge 4$, a large-time expansion of the solution with the leading term given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution multiplied by the factor $(4πt)^{-\frac n 2}$ corresponding to the decay for the heat equation.

It is well known that a closed subshift of $A^{\mathbb Z}$ has finite covering numbers w.r.t. $d_1$ if and only if it is mean-equicontinuous. Here we study, more generally, the scaling behavior of these covering numbers for individual orbits which are generic for an ergodic measure $μ$ on $A^{\mathbb Z}$ with discrete spectrum, and we explore their usefulness as invariants for block code equivalence. We illustrate this by developing tools to determine these covering numbers for various classes of $\mathcal B$-free numbers (in particular also for square-free numbers), and we provide a continuous family of measures $μ_s$, all with the same discrete spectrum generated by a single number, but such that $μ_s$- and $μ_{s'}$-typical $x$ resp. $x'\in A^{\mathbb Z}$ have sufficiently different growth of covering numbers such that there are no finite block codes mapping $x\to x'$ and $x'\to x$. (Indeed, both orbits have different amorphic complexities.)"

We precisely determine the conditions under which upward propagation, downward propagation or even propagation failure can occur in both bi-infinite and semi-infinite idealizations of the model. We also study the long-time behavior of the system when either a fixed external input is constantly presented at the first layer of the network or when this external input consists in the presentation of constant input with large amplitude for a fixed time window followed by a reset to a down state of the network for all later times. In both cases, we numerically demonstrate the existence of threshold behavior for the amplitude of the external input characterizing whether or not a full propagation within the network can occur. Our theoretical results are consistent with predictive coding theories and allow us to identify regions of parameters that could be associated with dysfunctional perceptions."

We then use several propositions to justify the properties of cardinality and integration and their compatibility with monoidal structure. We give a brief introduction of the definition and behaviors of semiadditive height. Focusing on stable monoidal $p$-local $\infty$-categories of height 1, for any finite group $G$, with the help of Möbius function and Burnside ring, we give an explicit decomposition of the cardinality of $BG$ into an expression of the cardinality of $BC_p$.

2505.09146,Optimization via First-Order Switching Methods: Skew-Symmetric Dynamics and Optimistic Discretization,['math.OC'],"['Antesh Upadhyay', 'Sang Bin Moon', 'Abolfazl Hashemi']","Large-scale constrained optimization problems are at the core of many tasks in control, signal processing, and machine learning. Notably, problems with functional constraints arise when, beyond a performance{\nobreakdash-}centric goal (e.g., minimizing the empirical loss), one desires to satisfy other requirements such as robustness, fairness, etc. A simple method for such problems, which remarkably achieves optimal rates for non-smooth, convex, strongly convex, and weakly convex functions under first-order oracle, is Switching Gradient Method (SGM): in each iteration depending on a predetermined constraint violation tolerance, use the gradient of objective or the constraint as the update vector. While the performance of SGM is well-understood for non-smooth functions and in fact matches its unconstrained counterpart, i.e., Gradient Descent (GD), less is formally established about its convergence properties under the smoothness of loss and constraint functions. In this work, we aim to fill this gap. First, we show that SGM may not benefit from faster rates under smoothness, in contrast to improved rates for GD under smoothness. By taking a continuous-time limit perspective, we show the issue is fundamental to SGM's dynamics and not an artifact of our analysis. Our continuous-time limit perspective further provides insights towards alleviating SGM's shortcomings. Notably, we show that leveraging the idea of optimism, a well-explored concept in variational inequalities and min-max optimization, could lead to faster methods. This perspective further enables designing a new class of ``soft'' switching methods, for which we further analyze their iteration complexity under mild assumptions."

Assuming that $ h $ satisfies a linear differential equation of order $ p\le n $ with rational coefficients, we establish a result that classifies the meromorphic solutions \( f \) into two cases based on the distribution of their zeros and poles. This result is then applied to study the zeros and critical points of entire solutions to certain higher-order linear differential equations, thereby extending some known results in the literature."

We start with finding suitable types of cusp labels and cone decompositions which are compatible with those of the associated Hodge-type Shimura varieties. We then study the action of $\mathbb{Q}$-points of the adjoint group on boundary charts and toroidal compactifications of Hodge-type integral models. In particular, we extend the twisting construction of Kisin and Pappas to boundary charts. Finally, up to taking refinements of cone decompositions, we construct an abelian-type toroidal compactification as an open and closed algebraic subspace of a quotient from a disjoint union of Hodge-type toroidal compactifications. Furthermore, we construct minimal compactifications with a similar method and verify Pink's formula when the level at $p$ is an intersection of $n$ quasi-parahoric subgroups."

A key contributing factor to this limitation is the failure of the stress components to satisfy the equilibrium relationships. This paper develops a novel quasi-3D beam models with equilibrium-based transverse normal stress expression for achieving accurate solutions of functionally graded beams. In contrast to the conventional quasi-3D models where stress expressions are derived from constitutive and geometric equations, the expressions of transverse shear stress and transverse normal stress in this study are derived according to the differential equilibrium equations among stresses, ensuring strict adherence of stress solutions to equilibrium conditions. To incorporate the influence of equilibrium-derived stress distributions, the equilibrium-based cross-sectional stiffness matrix is derived, enhancing the theoretical and practical feasibility of the beam model. In the numerical implementation, the mixed element method with generalized internal forces and generalized displacements regarded as two independent fields is employed to construct the beam element, and especially, semi-analytical internal force fields, which partially satisfy the differential equilibrium equations, are introduced to improve the element performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed quasi-3D beam model accurately predicts both displacement and stress fields in functionally graded beams, which exhibits the effectiveness of introducing stress equilibrium relationships."

Besides, when the model has a center-type equilibrium, we show that the model can admit five limit cycles bifurcated from Hopf bifurcation. Our results indicate that addictive Allee effect can induce not only richer dynamics and bifurcations, but also the coextinction of both populations with some positive initial densities. Finally, numerical simulations, including three limit cycles and four limit cycles, are presented to illustrate the theoretical results."

We establish a new and refined ""Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer type"" formula for Bloch-Kato Selmer groups of the central critical twist of $f$ via Kolyvagin derivatives of $L$-values instead of complex analytic or $p$-adic variation of $L$-values only under the Iwasawa main conjecture localized at the augmentation ideal. Our formula determines the exact rank and module structure of the Selmer groups and is insensitive to weight, the local behavior of $f$ at $p$, and analytic rank.
  As consequences, we prove the non-vanishing of Kato's Kolyvagin system and complete a ""discrete"" analogue of the Beilinson-Bloch-Kato conjecture for modular forms at ordinary primes. We also obtain the higher weight analogue of the $p$-converse to the theorem of Gross-Zagier and Kolyvagin, the $p$-parity conjecture, and a new computational upper bound of Selmer ranks. We also discuss how to formulate the refined conjecture on the non-vanishing of Kato's Kolyvagin system for modular forms of general weight.
  In the appendix with Robert Pollack, we compute several numerical examples on the structure of Selmer groups of elliptic curves and modular forms of higher weight. Sometimes our computation provides a deeper understanding of Selmer groups than what is predicted by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture."

We went on to study examples, and produced many for which the construction is involutive. By this we mean that, if you let $\mathcal{T}=\mathfrak{S}(\mathcal{S})^{\mathrm{op}}$, then there is a choice of metric on $\mathcal{T}$ for which $\mathcal{S}=\mathfrak{S}(\mathcal{T})^{\mathrm{op}}$. In this article we study this phenomenon much more carefully, with the focus being on understanding the metrics for which involutivity occurs. As it turns out there is a large class of them, the excellent metrics on triangulated categories. At the end we will produce a few new examples of excellent metrics. And our reason for going to all this trouble is that the results of this article will permit us to prove new and surprising statements about uniqueness of enhancements. Those results will come in a sequel to this article, which is joint with Canonaco and Stellari."
2505.09102,"Navigating the Space of Compact CMC Hypersurfaces in Spheres, Part II",['math.DG'],['Oscar Perdomo'],"In R^3, let M be the infinite union of unit spheres whose centers lie at even integers on the x-axis; every pair of consecutive spheres touches at (2m+1, 0, 0). Desingularizing these point contacts yields Delaunay's classical constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces, including unduloids and nodoids.
  Motivated by this picture, we construct an analogue in the unit sphere S^4. We begin with the piecewise-smooth hypersurface M contained in S^4, obtained by gluing two carefully chosen totally umbilical 3-spheres to two specific Clifford hypersurfaces, all four components sharing the same constant mean curvature and meeting along four disjoint circles.
  We provide numerical evidence that these circles can be desingularized: there exists a smooth one-parameter family Sigma_b, each lying in S^4, of CMC hypersurfaces such that Sigma_b approaches M as b tends to 0. The mean curvature H(b) varies smoothly along the family and vanishes at a single non-embedded minimal member. Moreover, there is a threshold B_1 in (0, B) such that when b < B_1 the hypersurface Sigma_b is embedded (""unduloid type""), whereas for b >= B_1 it is non-embedded (""nodoid type""). As b increases toward B, the hypersurfaces converge to a minimal hypersurface with two singular points."

That is, given census data and a fixed number of seats, how many seats should each state be assigned? Various algorithms exist to solve the apportionment problem, but by the Balinski-Young Theorem, every such algorithm will be flawed in some way. This paper focuses on divisor methods of apportionment, where the possible flaws are known as quota violations. This paper presents a detailed analysis of quota violations that can arise under divisor methods for three states. The study focuses on quota violations in Adams's, Jefferson's, Dean's, and the Huntington-Hill methods when allocating $M$ seats. Theoretical results are proved about the behavior of these methods, particularly focusing on the types of quota violations that may occur, their frequency, and their structure. The paper then introduces tests to detect quota violations, which are then employed to construct a probability function which calculates the likelihood of such violations occurring given an initial three state population vector whose components follow varying distributions."

A return to basic principles is necessary in order to show that ideas and concepts from sequential statistical methods can be adapted and applied to sequential scoring rule evaluation (SSRE). One key technical contribution of this paper is the development of a large deviations type result for SSRE schemes using a change of measure that parallels a traditional exponential tilting form. Further, we also show that SSRE will terminate in finite time with probability one, and that the moments of the SSRE stopping time exist. A second key contribution is to show that the exponential tilting form underlying our large deviations result allows us to cast SSRE within the framework of generalised e-values. Relying on this formulation, we devise sequential testing approaches that are both powerful and maintain control on error probabilities underlying the analysis. Through several simulated examples, we demonstrate that our e-values based SSRE approach delivers reliable results that are more powerful than more commonly applied testing methods precisely in the situations where these commonly applied methods can be expected to fail."
2505.09088,Derivative-free optimization is competitive for aerodynamic design optimization in moderate dimensions,"['math.OC', 'math.NA']","['Punya Plaban', 'Peter Bachman', 'Ashwin Renganathan']","Aerodynamic design optimization is an important problem in aircraft design that depends on the interplay between a numerical optimizer and a high-fidelity flow physics solver. Derivative-based, first and (quasi) second order, optimization techniques are the de facto choice, particularly given the availability of the adjoint method and its ability to efficiently compute gradients at the cost of just one solution of the forward problem. However, implementation of the adjoint method requires careful mathematical treatment, and its sensitivity to changes in mesh quality limits widespread applicability. Derivative-free approaches are often overlooked for large scale optimization, citing their lack of scalability in higher dimensions and/or the lack of practical interest in globally optimal solutions that they often target. However, breaking free from an adjoint solver can be paradigm-shifting in broadening the applicability of aerodynamic design optimization. We provide a systematic benchmarking of a select sample of widely used derivative-based and derivative-free optimization algorithms on the design optimization of three canonical aerodynamic bodies, namely, the NACA0012 and RAE2822 airfoils, and the ONERAM6 wing. Our results demonstrate that derivative-free methods are competitive with derivative-based methods, while outperforming them consistently in the high-dimensional setting. These findings highlight the practical competitiveness of modern derivative-free strategies, offering a scalable and robust alternative for aerodynamic design optimization when adjoint-based gradients are unavailable or unreliable."

Moreover, this tangent bundle functor is represented by the ring of dual numbers. How special is this tangent structure? Is there any other (non-trivial) tangent structure on the category of affine schemes? In this paper, we characterize the representable tangent structures on the category of affine schemes. To do so, we introduce a useful tool, the notion of tangentoids, which are the precisely the objects in a monoidal category that when tensoring with said objects give tangent structures. Therefore, coexponentiable tangentoids induce tangent structures on the opposite category. As such, we first prove that tangentoids in the category of commutative unital algebras are equivalent to commutative associative solid non-unital algebras, that is, commutative associative non-unital algebras whose multiplication is an isomorphism. From here, we then explain how representable tangent structures on affine schemes correspond to finitely generated projective commutative associative solid algebras. In particular, for affine schemes over a principal ideal domain, we show that there are precisely two representable tangent structures: the trivial one and the one given by Kähler differentials."
2505.09078,An accelerated proximal PRS-SQP algorithm with dual ascent-descent procedures for smooth composite optimization,['math.OC'],"['Jiachen Jin', 'Guodong Ma', 'Jinbao Jian']","Conventional wisdom in composite optimization suggests augmented Lagrangian dual ascent (ALDA) in Peaceman-Rachford splitting (PRS) methods for dual feasibility. However, ALDA may fail when the primal iterate is a local minimum, a stationary point, or a coordinatewise solution of the highly nonconvex augmented Lagrangian function. Splitting sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods utilize augmented Lagrangian dual descent (ALDD) to directly minimize the primal residual, circumventing the limitations of ALDA and achieving faster convergence in smooth optimization. This paper aims to present a fairly accessible generalization of two contrasting dual updates, ALDA and ALDD, for smooth composite optimization. A key feature of our PRS-SQP algorithm is its dual ascent-descent procedure, which provides a free direction rule for the dual updates and a new insight to explain the counterintuitive convergence behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a hybrid acceleration technique that combines inertial extrapolation and back substitution to improve convergence. Theoretically, we establish the feasibility for a wider range of acceleration factors than previously known and derive convergence rates within the Kurdyka- Lojasiewicz framework. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method in various dual-update scenarios."

2505.09072,On the expansion of a wedge of van der Waals gas into vacuum III: interaction of fan-shock-fan composite waves,['math.AP'],['Geng Lai'],"This paper studies the expansion into vacuum of a wedge of gas at rest. This problem catches several important classes of wave interactions in the context of 2D Riemann problems. When the gas at rest is a nonideal gas, the gas away from the sharp corner of the wedge may expand into the vacuum as two symmetrical planar rarefaction fan waves, shock-fan composite waves, or fan-shock-fan composite waves. Then the expansion in vacuum problem can be reduced to the interactions of these elementary waves. Global existences of classical solutions to the interaction of the fan waves and the interaction of the shock-fan composite waves were obtained by the author in [21,22]. In the present paper we study the third case: interaction of fan-shock-fan composite waves. In contrast to the first two cases, the third case involves shock waves in the interaction region and is actually a shock free boundary problem. Differing from the transonic shock free boundary problems arising in 2D Riemann problems for ideal gases, the type of the shocks for this shock free boundary problem is also a priori unknown. This results in the fact that the formulation of the boundary conditions on the shocks is also a priori unknown. By calculating the curvatures of the shocks and using the Liu's extended entropy condition, we prove that the shocks in the interaction region must be post-sonic (in the sense of the flow velocity relative to the shock front). We also prove that the shocks are envelopes of one out of the two families of wave characteristics of the flow behind them, and not characteristics. By virtue of the hodograph transformation method and the characteristic decomposition method, we construct a global-in-time piecewise smooth solution to the expansion in vacuum problem for the third case."
2505.09070,Reflected stochastic recursive control problems with jumps: dynamic programming and stochastic verification theorems,['math.OC'],"['Lu Liu', 'Qingmeng Wei']","This paper mainly investigates reflected stochastic recursive control problems governed by jump-diffusion dynamics. The system's state evolution is described by a stochastic differential equation driven by both Brownian motion and Poisson random measures, while the recursive cost functional is formulated via the solution process Y of a reflected backward stochastic differential equation driven by the same dual stochastic sources. By establishing the dynamic programming principle, we provide the probabilistic interpretation of an obstacle problem for partial integro-differential equations of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type in the viscosity solution sense through our control problem's value function. Furthermore, the value function is proved to inherit the semi-concavity and joint Lipschitz continuity in state and time coordinates, which play key roles in deriving stochastic verification theorems of control problem within the framework of viscosity solutions. We remark that some restrictions in previous study are eliminated, such as the frozen of the reflected processes in time and state, and the independence of the driver from diffusion variables."
2505.09067,Solving Reach- and Stabilize-Avoid Problems Using Discounted Reachability,"['math.OC', 'cs.RO', 'eess.SY']","['Boyang Li', 'Zheng Gong', 'Sylvia Herbert']","In this article, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid (RA) and stabilize-avoid (SA) zero-sum game problems for general nonlinear continuous-time systems, where the goal is to find the set of states that can be controlled to reach or stabilize to a target set, without violating constraints even under the worst-case disturbance. Based on the Hamilton-Jacobi reachability method, we address the RA problem by designing a new Lipschitz continuous RA value function, whose zero sublevel set exactly characterizes the RA set. We establish that the associated Bellman backup operator is contractive and that the RA value function is the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequality. Finally, we develop a two-step framework for the SA problem by integrating our RA strategies with a recently proposed Robust Control Lyapunov-Value Function, thereby ensuring both target reachability and long-term stability. We numerically verify our RA and SA frameworks on a 3D Dubins car system to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."
2505.09064,Vertex-based auxiliary space multigrid method and its application to linear elasticity equations,['math.NA'],"['Jiayin Li', 'Jinbiao Wu', 'Wenqian Zhang', 'Jiawen Liu']","In this paper, a vertex-based auxiliary space multigrid(V-ASMG) method as a preconditioner of the PCG method is proposed for solving the large sparse linear equations derived from the linear elasticity equations. The main key of such V-ASMG method lies in an auxiliary region-tree structure based on the geometrically regular subdivision. The computational complexity of building such a region-tree is $\mathcal{O}\left(q N\log_2 N\right)$, where $N$ is the number of the given original grid vertices and $q$ is the power of the ratio of the maximum distance $d_{max}$ to minimum distance $d_{min}$ between the given original grid vertices. The process of constructing the auxiliary region-tree is similar to the method in [17], but the selection of the representative points is changed. To be more specific, instead of choosing the barycenters, the correspondence between each grid layer is constructed based on the position relationship of the grid vertices. There are two advantages for this approach: the first is its simplicity, there is no need to deal with hanging points when building the auxiliary region-tree, and it is possible to construct the restriction/prolongation operator directly by using the bilinear interpolation function, and it is easy to be generalized to other problems as well, due to all the information we need is only the grid vertices; the second is its strong convergence, the corresponding relative residual can quickly converge to the given tolerance(It is taken to be $10^{-6}$ in this paper), thus obtaining the desired numerical solution. Two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments are given to verify the strong convergence of the proposed V-ASMG method as a preconditioner of the PCG method."

We provide convergence guarantees of the proposed method, and as a corollary of our analysis, we provide a new proof for the convergence of the classic randomized Kaczmarz method. We demonstrate experimentally the behavior of our method when applied to related problems. For underdetermined systems, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be used for sparse approximation. For inconsistent systems, we demonstrate that our algorithm converges to a horizon of the least squares solution. Finally, we apply our algorithm to real data and show that it is consistent with the selection of Lasso, while still offering the computational advantages of the Kaczmarz framework and thresholding-based algorithms in the federated setting."

2505.09045,The Adaptive Complexity of Finding a Stationary Point,"['math.OC', 'cs.CC', 'cs.DC']","['Huanjian Zhou', 'Andi Han', 'Akiko Takeda', 'Masashi Sugiyama']","In large-scale applications, such as machine learning, it is desirable to design non-convex optimization algorithms with a high degree of parallelization. In this work, we study the adaptive complexity of finding a stationary point, which is the minimal number of sequential rounds required to achieve stationarity given polynomially many queries executed in parallel at each round.
  For the high-dimensional case, i.e., $d = \widetildeΩ(\varepsilon^{-(2 + 2p)/p})$, we show that for any (potentially randomized) algorithm, there exists a function with Lipschitz $p$-th order derivatives such that the algorithm requires at least $\varepsilon^{-(p+1)/p}$ iterations to find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. Our lower bounds are tight and show that even with $\mathrm{poly}(d)$ queries per iteration, no algorithm has better convergence rate than those achievable with one-query-per-round algorithms. In other words, gradient descent, the cubic-regularized Newton's method, and the $p$-th order adaptive regularization method are adaptively optimal. Our proof relies upon novel analysis with the characterization of the output for the hardness potentials based on a chain-like structure with random partition.
  For the constant-dimensional case, i.e., $d = Θ(1)$, we propose an algorithm that bridges grid search and gradient flow trapping, finding an approximate stationary point in constant iterations. Its asymptotic tightness is verified by a new lower bound on the required queries per iteration. We show there exists a smooth function such that any algorithm running with $Θ(\log (1/\varepsilon))$ rounds requires at least $\widetildeΩ((1/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ queries per round. This lower bound is tight up to a logarithmic factor, and implies that the gradient flow trapping is adaptively optimal."

The short-term objective, such as arbitrage or load smoothing, improves with more battery cycling, while the long-term objective is to maximize battery lifetime, which discourages cycling. Using a semi-empirical aging model, we formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem. We use model predictive control (MPC) with a convex approximation of aging dynamics to optimally manage the trade-off between performance and degradation.

Upon variation of $λ$ there is a percolation phase transition: there exists a critical value $λ_c>0$ such that for $λ<λ_c$ all clusters are finite, but infinite clusters exist for $λ>λ_c$. We identify certain critical exponents that characterize the clusters at (and near) $λ_c$, and show that they agree with the mean-field values for percolation. We derive the exponents through isoperimetric properties of critical percolation clusters rather than via a calculation of the triangle diagram."

The holding company seeks to design an optimal incentive scheme to mitigate these losses. In response, the subsidiary selects an optimal cybersecurity investment strategy, modeled through a stochastic epidemiological SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) framework. The cyber threat landscape is captured through an L-hop risk framework with two primary sources of risk: (i) internal risk propagation via the contagion parameters in the SIR model, and (ii) external cyberattacks from a malicious external hacker. The uncertainty and adversarial nature of the hacking lead to consider a robust stochastic control approach that allows for increased volatility and ambiguity induced by cyber incidents. The agency problem is formulated as a max-min bilevel stochastic control problem with accidents. First, we derive the incentive compatibility condition by reducing the subsidiary's optimal response to the solution of a second-order backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. Next, we demonstrate that the principal's problem can be equivalently reformulated as an integro-partial Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation. By extending the stochastic Perron's method to our setting, we show that the value function of the problem is the unique viscosity solution to the resulting integro-partial HJBI equation."

Hierarchical structured deformations provide a mathematical setting for the description of such changes and for the variational determination of the corresponding energetic response. The research in this article provides substantial refinements and broadenings of the mathematical setting both for the underlying geometrical structure and for the variational analysis of energetic response. The mathematical tools employed in this research include the global method for relaxation and establish the equivalence of a relaxed energy obtained via relaxation under simultaneous geometrical changes at all levels and a relaxed energy obtained via iterated relaxations proceeding from the deepest submacroscopic level successively to the macroscopic level.

We prove lower bounds for the steady-state occupancy, i.e., the complementary cumulative distribution function of the empirical queue length distribution. The lower bounds are geometric with ratios given by two flexibility metrics: the average degree of the dispatchers and a novel metric that averages the minimum degree over the compatible dispatchers across the servers. Using these lower bounds, we establish that the asymptotic performance of a growing processing network cannot match that of the classic Power-of-$d$ or JSQ policies unless the flexibility metrics approach infinity in the large-scale limit."

2505.08969,On a Modified Random Genetic Drift Model: Derivation and a Structure-Preserving Operator-Splitting Discretization,['math.NA'],"['Chi-An Chen', 'Chun Liu', 'Yiwei Wang']","One of the fundamental mathematical models for studying random genetic drift is the Kimura equation, derived as the large-population limit of the discrete Wright-Fisher model. However, due to the degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient, it is impossible to impose a suitable boundary condition that ensures the Kimura equation admits a classical solution while preserving biological significance. In this work, we propose a modified model for random genetic drift that admits classical solutions by modifying the domain of the Kimura equation from $(0, 1)$ to $(δ, 1 - δ)$ with $δ$ being a small parameter, which allows us to impose a Robin-type boundary condition. By introducing two additional variables for the probabilities in the boundary region, we effectively capture the conservation of mass and the fixation dynamics in the original model. To numerically investigate the modified model, we develop a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian operator splitting scheme. The scheme first solves the flow map equation in the bulk region using a Lagrangian approach with a no-flux boundary condition, followed by handling the boundary dynamics in Eulerian coordinates. This hybrid scheme ensures mass conservation, maintains positivity, and preserves the first moment. Various numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and structure-preserving properties of the proposed scheme. Numerical results demonstrate the key qualitative features of the original Kimura equation, including the fixation behavior and the correct stationary distribution in the small-$δ$ limit."

We characterize which star sign patterns require, which allow, and which do not allow the nSMP. We show that if a pattern requires distinct eigenvalues, then it requires the nSMP. Further, we characterize the patterns that allow the nSMP as being precisely the set of patterns that allow distinct eigenvalues, a property that corresponds to a simple feature of the associated digraph. We also characterize the sign patterns of order at most three according to whether they require, allow, or do not allow the nSMP."

We do this by relating the DEC solutions to the lowest order finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) solutions. A Poincaré inequality and a discrete inf-sup condition for DEC are part of this proof. We also prove that under appropriate geometric conditions on the mesh the DEC and FEEC norms are equivalent. Only one side of the norm equivalence is needed for proving stability and convergence and this allows us to relax the conditions on the meshes.

However, analyzing MIT data is mathematically complex because of the non-linear and ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. In this framework, the Monotonicity Principle is recognized as an effective approach to solve the inverse obstacle problem in realistic situations and real-time operations.
  To date, the Monotonicity Principle has been found for elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs, even in the presence of nonlinearities. Magnetic Induction Tomography is modeled by a parabolic PDE. The physics of this dissipative system pose severe challenges from the theoretical and applied perspectives. To date, the Monotonicity Principles for MIT have been found only for proper asymptotic approximations or source-free problems.
  This article recognizes that the operator mapping the Laplace transform of the applied source onto the measured quantity (Transfer Operator) satisfies a Monotonicity Principle on a real semi-axis of the complex plane. Therefore, this article introduces the concept of transfer operator in Magnetic Induction Tomography, proves a Monotonicity Principle for the transfer operator evaluated on a proper real semi-axis of the complex plane, and provides a description of the related (real-time) imaging method."

In (Leipus et al., AIMS Mathematics, 2023), the authors presented a particular example of a light-tailed random variable that is the minimum of two independent heavy-tailed random variables. We will show that this phenomenon is universal: {\it any} light-tailed random variable with right-unbounded support may be represented as the minimum of two independent heavy-tailed random variables. Moreover, a more general fact holds: these two independent random variables may have as heavy-tailed distributions as one wishes. Further, we will extend the latter result onto the minimum of any finite number of independent random variables. We will also comment on possible generalizations of our result to the case of dependent random variables."

Central to this work is the generalized double bracket (GDB) vector field-a geometric construct introduced in our earlier work-which generalizes gradient dynamics to indefinite metric settings. We identify admissible regions where the so-called double bracket metric remains non-degenerate on symplectic leaves, enabling the GDB vector field to function as a gradient flow on the admissible regions with respect to this metric. We illustrate these concepts with a variety of examples and carefully discuss the complications that arise when the pseudo-Riemannian metric fails to induce a non-degenerate metric on certain regions of the symplectic leaves."
2505.08937,Reduced Order Modeling for First Order Hyperbolic Systems with Application to Multiparameter Acoustic Waveform Inversion,['math.NA'],"['Liliana Borcea', 'Josselin Garnier', 'Alexander V. Mamonov', 'Jörn Zimmerling']","Waveform inversion seeks to estimate an inaccessible heterogeneous medium from data gathered by sensors that emit probing signals and measure the generated waves. It is an inverse problem for a second order wave equation or a first order hyperbolic system, with the sensor excitation modeled as a forcing term and the heterogeneous medium described by unknown, spatially variable coefficients. The traditional ``full waveform inversion"" (FWI) formulation estimates the unknown coefficients via minimization of the nonlinear, least squares data fitting objective function. For typical band-limited and high frequency data, this objective function has spurious local minima near and far from the true coefficients. Thus, FWI implemented with gradient based optimization algorithms may fail, even for good initial guesses. Recently, it was shown that it is possible to obtain a better behaved objective function for wave speed estimation, using data driven reduced order models (ROMs) that capture the propagation of pressure waves, governed by the classic second order wave equation. Here we introduce ROMs for vectorial waves, satisfying a general first order hyperbolic system. They are defined via Galerkin projection on the space spanned by the wave snapshots, evaluated on a uniform time grid with appropriately chosen time step. Our ROMs are data driven: They are computed in an efficient and non-iterative manner, from the sensor measurements, without knowledge of the medium and the snapshots. The ROM computation applies to any linear waves in lossless and non-dispersive media. For the inverse problem we focus attention on acoustic waves in a medium with unknown variable wave speed and density. We show that these can be determined via minimization of an objective function that uses a ROM based approximation of the vectorial wave field inside the inaccessible medium."

2505.08908,Statistical Decision Theory with Counterfactual Loss,"['math.ST', 'cs.LG', 'econ.TH']","['Benedikt Koch', 'Kosuke Imai']","Many researchers have applied classical statistical decision theory to evaluate treatment choices and learn optimal policies. However, because this framework is based solely on realized outcomes under chosen decisions and ignores counterfactual outcomes, it cannot assess the quality of a decision relative to feasible alternatives. For example, in bail decisions, a judge must consider not only crime prevention but also the avoidance of unnecessary burdens on arrestees. To address this limitation, we generalize standard decision theory by incorporating counterfactual losses, allowing decisions to be evaluated using all potential outcomes. The central challenge in this counterfactual statistical decision framework is identification: since only one potential outcome is observed for each unit, the associated counterfactual risk is generally not identifiable. We prove that, under the assumption of strong ignorability, the counterfactual risk is identifiable if and only if the counterfactual loss function is additive in the potential outcomes. Moreover, we demonstrate that additive counterfactual losses can yield treatment recommendations, which differ from those based on standard loss functions when the decision problem involves more than two treatment options. One interpretation of this result is that additive counterfactual losses can capture the accuracy and difficulty of a decision, whereas standard losses account for accuracy alone. Finally, we formulate a symbolic linear inverse program that, given a counterfactual loss, determines whether its risk is identifiable, without requiring data."

The lower boundary of this region is given by the Neyman-Pearson lemma, and is up to a coordinate change, equivalent to the optimal ROC curve. We establish a novel lower bound for the boundary in terms of any $f$-divergence. Since the bound generated by hockey-stick $f$-divergences characterizes the Neyman-Pearson boundary, this bound is best possible. In the case of KL divergence, this bound improves Pinsker's inequality. Furthermore, we obtain a closed-form refined upper bound for the Neyman-Pearson boundary in terms of the Chernoff $α$-coefficient. Finally, we present methods for constructing pairs of distributions that can approximately or exactly realize any given Neyman-Pearson boundary."

We explore the advantages of the JFNK method relative to the Newton-Krylov (NK) method and identify the circumstances in which the JFNK method demonstrates computing efficiency. We perform the validation and efficiency of the JFNK method on various test cases involving an unconfined single-layer aquifer and a two-layer aquifer with both confined and unconfined conditions. The results are validated by the NK method. The JFNK method is incorporated in Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM), an integrated hydrologic model developed and maintained by California Department of Water Resources. We examine the determinacy of the JFNK's adaptability on practical models such as the California Central Valley Groundwater-Surface Water Simulation Model (C2VSim)."

In this paper, we continue this theme by studying two interconnected problems regarding projections of geometric objects in four-dimensional spaces:
  (1) Let $A$ be a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the areas of the six coordinate projections of $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative real numbers can arise in this way?
  (2) Let $S$ be an irreducible surface in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the degrees of the six coordinate projections from $S$ to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative integers can arise in this way?
  We show that these questions are governed by the Plücker relations for the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(2,4)$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_2$. We extend our analysis by determining the homology classes in $(\mathbb{P}^m)^n$ proportional to the fundamental classes of irreducible algebraic surfaces, resolving the algebraic Steenrod problem in this setting. Our results lead to several conjectures on realizable homology classes in smooth projective varieties and on the projection volumes of convex bodies."

Mohammed', 'Mehmet Yavuz']","Cholera remains a significant public health challenge globally, particularly affecting regions with inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructures. This study presents a comprehensive mathematical model extending the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model by explicitly incorporating both direct human-to-human and indirect environment-to-human transmission routes of Vibrio cholerae. The proposed model systematically integrates three primary intervention strategies-human sanitation, environmental sanitation, and vaccination. We derive the basic reproduction number (R0) through rigorous mathematical analyses and establish stability conditions for disease-free and endemic equilibria. Numerical simulations underscore the superior Efficacy of combined intervention approaches, demonstrating significant reductions in infection prevalence and epidemic duration compared to singular strategies. Sensitivity and bifurcation analyses highlight the critical influence of environmental transmission parameters, emphasizing water treatment's pivotal role in effective cholera prevention. This study provides a robust quantitative basis for formulating optimized, context-specific cholera control policies, particularly suited for implementation in resource-limited settings."

We show their existence and cone-invariance, investigate their first and second order moment structure, and derive explicit conditions for their stationarity. Specifically, we define a measure-valued CARMA process as the analytically weak solution of a linear state-space model in the Banach space of finite signed measures. By selecting suitable input, transition, and output operators in the linear state-space model, we show that the resulting solution possesses CARMA dynamics and remains in the cone of positive measures defined on some spatial domain. We also illustrate how positive measure-valued CARMA processes can be used to model the dynamics of functionals of spatio-temporal random fields and connect our framework to existing CARMA-type models from the literature, highlighting its flexibility and broader applicability."
2505.08839,On the equivalence between moderate growth-type conditions in the weight matrix setting II,['math.CA'],['Gerhard Schindl'],"We continue the study of the known equivalent reformulations of the classical moderate growth condition for weight sequences in the mixed setting; i.e. when dealing with two different sequences. This approach is becoming crucial in the weight matrix setting and also, in particular, when dealing with weight functions in the sense of Braun-Meise-Taylor. It is known that a full generalization to the mixed setting fails, more precisely the condition comparing the growth of the corresponding sequences of quotients and roots is not clear. In the main result we prove a new characterization of this property in terms of the associated weight function; i.e. when the given weight function is based on a weight sequence."

We give more details for the Kronecker cone (that is the asymptotic support of the Kronecker coefficients) and the fermionic cone. These two cases correspond to the action of $GL_{d_1}(\mathbb C)\times\cdots\times GL_{d_s}(\mathbb C)$ on $\mathbb C^{d_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbb C^{d_s}$ and $GL_d(\mathbb C)$ on $\bigwedge^r\mathbb C^d$, respectively. These two cases are implemented in Python-Sage. Available at https://ea-icj.github.io/, our algorithm improves in several directions, the one given by Vergne-Walter in Inequalities for Moment Cones of Finite-Dimensional Representations. For example, it can compute the minimal list of 463 inequalities for the Kronecker cone $(5,5,5)$ in 20 minutes. An important ingredient is an algorithm that decides whether an application is birational or not. It could be of independent interest in effective algebraic geometry."

Belykh']","We consider a certain three-dimensional piecewise linear system of Lorenz type in the cases of positive and negative saddle value, which is the sum of two eigenvalues of the saddle nearest to zero. This system was recently proposed and studied in \cite{belykh2019lorenz} for the case of the positive saddle value. Here we consider the main bifurcations leading to the birth of the strange attractor and provide its comparison with those of original smooth Lorenz model. For the case of a negative saddle value, we obtain an explicit forms of homoclinic and pitchfork bifurcations forming a codimension 1 cascade leading to the emergence of a quasi-strange attractor. This cascade reproduces a typical bifurcation route towards the birth of a quasi-strange attractor in smooth Lorenz-like systems with the negative saddle value. We support our analytical result with a numerical comparison with the Lorenz-Lyubimov-Zaks system."

We describe properties of this double functor and recover some classical results of topos theory through a new notion of locally exact square, generalizing exact squares in the presence of topologies. We also describe a 2-comonad on $\Cat$ for which lax morphisms of coalgebras are morphisms of sites and colax morphisms are comorphisms of sites, explaining the arrangement as a double category."

We show that the class is always stable and show that superstability in the class is characterized algebraically via weakly noetherian monoids.
  The study of these model-theoretic notions and limit models lead us to introduce parametized weakly noetherian monoids and find a characterization of them via parametrized injective acts. Furthermore, we obtain a characterization of weakly noetherian monoids via absolutely pure acts extending a classical result of ring theory.
  The paper is aimed at algebraists and model theorists so an effort was made to provide the background for both."
2505.08755,Computing Projective Implicit Representations from Poset Towers,"['math.AT', 'cs.CG']","['Tamal K. Dey', 'Florian Russold']","A family of simplicial complexes, connected with simplicial maps and indexed by a poset $P$, is called a poset tower. The concept of poset towers subsumes classical objects of study in the persistence literature, as, for example, one-critical multi-filtrations and zigzag filtrations, but also allows multi-critical simplices and arbitrary simplicial maps. The homology of a poset tower gives rise to a $P$-persistence module. To compute this homology globally over $P$, in the spirit of the persistence algorithm, we consider the homology of a chain complex of $P$-persistence modules, $C_{\ell-1}\xleftarrow{}C_\ell\xleftarrow{}C_{\ell+1}$, induced by the simplices of the poset tower. Contrary to the case of one-critical filtrations, the chain-modules $C_\ell$ of a poset tower can have a complicated structure. In this work, we tackle the problem of computing a representation of such a chain complex segment by projective modules and $P$-graded matrices, which we call a projective implicit representation (PiRep). We give efficient algorithms to compute asymptotically minimal projective resolutions (up to the second term) of the chain modules and the boundary maps and compute a PiRep from these resolutions. Our algorithms are tailored to the chain complexes and resolutions coming from poset towers and take advantage of their special structure. In the context of poset towers, they are fully general and could potentially serve as a foundation for developing more efficient algorithms on specific posets."

The parameters satisfy $ α, l, σ> 0 $, $ β, ν\geq 0 $, $ k, m, s \geq 1 $, $ r \geq p - 1 \geq \frac{p}{2}$, and $γ, μ\in \mathbb{R}$.
  We establish a comparison principle for this problem. Using this principle, we derive blow-up results as well as global-in-time boundedness of solutions. Our results extend and unify previous studies in the literature."

Hughston']","The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices signifying major chords and twelve black vertices signifying minor chords. This so-called Levi graph uniquely determines the combinatorial geometry of a remarkable configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in the real projective plane with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four principal hexacycles and the three principal octacycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century voice leading, can be read off rather directly as properties of the configuration. We show how analogous tone networks can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music."

Depending on the domain of the functional, two different $Γ$-limits are possible, one of which is nonlocal, and related to the notion of jump minimizing lifting, i.e., a lifting of a map $u$ whose measure of the jump set is minimal. The latter requires ad hoc compactness results for sequences of liftings which, besides being interesting by themselves, also allow to deduce existence of a jump minimizing lifting."
2505.08722,Properties of LCM Lattices of Monomial Ideals,"['math.AC', 'math.CO']","['Matthew Dorang', 'Jason McCullough']","LCM lattices were introduced by Gasharov, Peeva, and Welker as a way to study minimal free resolutions of monomial ideals. All LCM lattices are atomic and all atomic lattices arise as the LCM lattice of some monomial ideal. We systematically study other lattice properties of LCM lattices. For lattices associated to the edge ideal of a graph, we completely characterize the many standard lattice properties in terms of the associated graphs: Boolean, modular, upper semimodular, lower semimodular, supersolvable, coatomic, and complemented; edge ideals with graded LCM lattices were previously characterized by Nevo and Peeva as those associated to gap-free graphs. Such a characterization for arbitrary monomial ideals appears to be out of reach. However, we prove the Cohen-Macaulayness of minimal monomial ideals associated to modular lattices. We also prove separate necessary and sufficient lattice conditions for when the projective dimension of a monomial ideal matches the height of its LCM lattice."

We say that $A$ satisfies the SP if every bounded homomorphism $A\to B(K)$, with $K$ a Hilbert space, is similar to a $*$-homomorphism. We introduce three hypotheses that relate to extending hyperreflexive algebras by projections. We prove that our third hypothesis is equivalent to every finitely generated C*-algebra satisfying the SP.
  We show that to prove that every von Neumann algebra is hyperreflexive it is enough to show that when one extends a hyperreflexive algebra by a single projection it remains hyperreflexive."

The method uses a single short trajectory of a dynamical system without any continuation or initial guesses. No preferred coordinate system is required, meaning the method is practical for physical systems where the user does not have much \textit{a priori} knowledge. Three main tools are used to obtain the rotation vector of the invariant torus: the reduced rank extrapolation method, Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimation, and a Korkine-Zolatarev lattice basis reduction. The parameterization of the torus is found via a least-squares approach. The robustness of the algorithm is demonstrated by accurately computing many two-dimensional invariant tori of a standard map example. Examples of islands and three-dimensional invariant tori are shown as well."

Under a minimal set of assumptions, we show how to build from these data a universal Kolyvagin system for the representation and for its anticyclotomic twist. Eventually, we recover some applications to the structure of Selmer groups and Iwasawa main conjectures and we review a few concrete examples of these abstract notions that can be found in the literature."

Haile']","In this work, we prove what appear to be the first Reynolds-semi-robust and pressure-robust velocity error estimates for an H(div)-conforming approximation of unsteady incompressible flows of power-law type fluids. The proposed methods hinges on a discontinuous Galerkin approximation of the viscous term and a reinforced upwind-type stabilization of the convective term. The derived velocity error estimates account for pre-asymptotic orders of convergence observed in convection-dominated flows through regime-dependent estimates of the error contributions. A complete set of numerical results validate the theoretical findings."
2505.08702,Uniformly boundedness of finite Morse index solutions to semilinear elliptic equations with rapidly growing nonlinearities in two dimensions,['math.AP'],['Kenta Kumagai'],"We consider the Gelfand problem with rapidly growing nonlinearities in the two-dimensional bounded strictly convex domains. In this paper, we prove the uniformly boundedness of finite Morse index solutions. As a result, we show that there exists a solution curve having infinitely many bifurcation/turning points. These results are recently proved by the present author for supercritical nonlinearities when the domain is the unit ball via an ODE argument. Instead of the ODE argument, we apply a new method focusing on the interaction between the growth condition of the nonlinearities and the shape of the fundamental solution. As a result, we clarify the bifurcation structure for general convex domains."

For example we prove Coxeter groups are good in the sense of Serre and that various splittings of Coxeter groups arising from actions on trees are detected by the profinite completion. As an application we prove a number of families Coxeter groups are profinitely rigid amongst Coxeter groups. We also prove that Gromov-hyperbolic FC type, large type, and odd Coxeter groups are almost profinitely rigid amongst Coxeter groups. In the appendix, Sam Fisher and Sam Hughes show that the Atiyah Conjecture holds for all Coxeter groups, and that $\ell^2$-Betti numbers and their positive characteristic analogues are profinite invariants of Coxeter groups and of virtually compact special groups."

For Tonelli Hamiltonians, these solutions are generated by the Lax-Oleinik operator. It is known that this operator converges in the autonomous framework, but this convergence fails in the general cases. In this paper, we introduce a method to construct smooth, recurrent, non-periodic viscosity solutions on fixed compact manifolds $M$ of dimension 2 or higher. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of the non-wandering set of the Lax-Oleinik operator and identify its action on various omega-limit sets."
2505.08697,A topos for extended Weihrauch degrees,"['math.CT', 'math.LO']","['Samuele Maschio', 'Davide Trotta']","Weihrauch reducibility is a notion of reducibility between computational problems that is useful to calibrate the uniform computational strength of a multivalued function. It complements the analysis of mathematical theorems done in reverse mathematics, as multi-valued functions on represented spaces can be considered as realizers of theorems in a natural way. Despite the rich literature and the relevance of the applications of category theory in logic and realizability, actually there are just a few works starting to study the Weihrauch reducibility from a categorical point of view. The main purpose of this work is to provide a full categorical account to the notion of extended Weihrauch reducibility introduced by A. Bauer, which generalizes the original notion of Weihrauch reducibility. In particular, we present a tripos and a topos for extended Weihrauch degrees. We start by defining a new tripos, abstracting the notion of extended Weihrauch degrees, and then we apply the tripos-to-topos construction to obtain the desired topos. Then we show that the Kleene-Vesley topos is a topos of $j$-sheaves for a certain Lawvere-Tierney topology over the topos of extended Weihrauch degrees."
2505.08678,Critical point localization and multiplicity results in Banach spaces via Nehari manifold technique,['math.AP'],"['Radu Precup', 'Andrei Stan']","In the paper, results on the existence of critical points in annular subsets of a cone are obtained with the additional goal of obtaining multiplicity results. Compared to other approaches in the literature based on the use of Krasnoselskii's compression-extension theorem or topological index methods, our approach uses the Nehari manifold technique in a surprising combination with the cone version of Birkhoff-Kellogg's invariant-direction theorem. This yields a simpler alternative to traditional methods involving deformation arguments or Ekeland variational principle. The new method is illustrated on a boundary value problem for p-Laplacian equations, and we believe that it will be useful for proving the existence, localization, and multiplicity of solutions for other classes of problems with variational structure."

The proof of these results is based on a novel stability estimate for the weighted mean and on a quantitative concentration inequality for the microscopic particle system around the empirical mean. Our propagation of chaos result recovers the classical Monte Carlo rate, with a prefactor that depends explicitly on the parameters of the problem. Notably, in the case of CBO with anisotropic noise, this prefactor is independent of the problem dimension."

Based on this, we work out a conjectural formula for the $L^2$-mass of the pullback of $F$ via the CFKRS heuristics, which becomes a weighted average (over $g$) of the central $L$-values. We show that on average over $f$, the main term predicted by the above heuristics matches with the actual main term. We also provide several results and sufficient conditions that ensure the non-vanishing of the pullbacks."

The convex hull of a set of vertices is the smallest convex set containing the set. We study two games in which two players take turns selecting vertices of a graph until the convex hull of the remaining unselected vertices is too small. The last player to move is the winner. The achievement game ends when the convex hull of the unselected vertices does not contain every vertex in the graph. In the avoidance game, the convex hull of the remaining vertices must contain every vertex. We determine the nim-number of these games for the family of grid graphs. We also provide some results for lattice graphs. Key tools in this analysis are delayed gamegraphs, option preserving maps, and case analysis diagrams."

It is known that in absence of second order effects, solutions for general initial data converge at an exponential rate in time to the unique stationary profile. Our main result is that if the strength of the additional forces is sufficiently small, this global exponential equilibration behavior persists, at a slightly smaller rate. Our proof uses the formulation of the equation as a Wasserstein gradient flow, and an auxiliary lower-order Lyapunov functional."
2505.08634,Small hitting sets for longest paths and cycles,['math.CO'],"['Sergey Norin', 'Raphael Steiner', 'Stephan Thomassé', 'Paul Wollan']","Motivated by an old question of Gallai (1966) on the intersection of longest paths in a graph and the well-known conjectures of Lovász (1969) and Thomassen (1978) on the maximum length of paths and cycles in vertex-transitive graphs, we present improved bounds for the parameters $\mathrm{lpt}(G)$ and $\mathrm{lct}(G)$, defined as the minimum size of a set of vertices in a graph $G$ hitting all longest paths (cycles, respectively). First, we show that every connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices satisfies $\mathrm{lpt}(G)\le \sqrt{8n}$, and $\mathrm{lct}(G)\le \sqrt{8n}$ if $G$ is additionally $2$-connected. This improves a sequence of earlier bounds for these problems, with the previous state of the art being $O(n^{2/3})$. Second, we show that every connected graph $G$ satisfies $\mathrm{lpt}(G)\le O(\ell^{5/9})$, where $\ell$ denotes the maximum length of a path in $G$. As an immediate application of this latter bound, we present further progress towards Lovász' and Thomassen's conjectures: We show that every connected vertex-transitive graph of order $n$ contains a cycle (and path) of length $Ω(n^{9/14})$. This improves the previous best bound of the form $Ω(n^{13/21})$. Interestingly, our proofs make use of several concepts and results from structural graph theory, such as a result of Robertson and Seymour (1990) on transactions in societies and Tutte's $2$-separator theorem."

Moreover, in clinical applications, it is essential to employ computational tools that provide only relevant information, ensuring clarity and ease of interpretation. In this work, we exploit two recently proposed operator learning approaches, namely Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and Kernel Operator Learning (KOL), to learn the operator mapping the applied stimulus in the physical domain into the activation and repolarization time distributions. These data-driven methods are evaluated on synthetic 2D and 3D domains, as well as on a physiologically realistic left ventricle geometry. Notably, while the learned map between the applied current and activation time has its modelling counterpart in the Eikonal model, no equivalent partial differential equation (PDE) model is known for the map between the applied current and repolarization time. Our results demonstrate that both FNO and KOL approaches are robust to hyperparameter choices and computationally efficient compared to traditional PDE-based Monodomain models. These findings highlight the potential use of these surrogate operators to accelerate cardiac simulations and facilitate their clinical integration."

There are two main techniques: by taking a locally projective resolution of a projective partial resolution as in our previous work arXiv:2311.07539, and more generally by taking quotients of open subsets of representation space which are not stable loci, related to Arzhantsev--Derental--Hausen--Laface's construction in the setting of Cox rings. By the latter method we exhibit a proper crepant resolution that does not factor through a projective partial resolution. Most of our quiver settings involve one-dimensional vector spaces, hence the resolutions are toric hyperkähler, which were studied from a different point of view in Arbo and Proudfoot arXiv:1511.09138.
  This builds on the classification of projective crepant resolutions of a large class of quiver varieties in arXiv:2212.09623 and the classification of proper crepant resolutions for the hyperpolygon quiver varieties in arXiv:2406.04117."
2505.08609,A new class of compactified Jacobians for families of reduced curves,['math.AG'],"['Marco Fava', 'Nicola Pagani', 'Filippo Viviani']","This is the first paper of a series of three. Here we give an abstract definition of the relative compactified Jacobian of a family of reduced curves. We prove that, under some mild assumptions on the family of curves, the fibres of the relative Jacobian are schemes (and not just algebraic spaces).
  We define V-stability conditions, and use them to construct relative compactified Jacobians. This extends the classical methods to produce modular compactifications of the Jacobian. To conclude, we show that, in the case when the curves have at worst planar singularities, the compactified Jacobians constructed from V-stability conditions have the same good properties of the classical ones."
2505.08602,Well-posedness and stability of the Lagrange representation of the n-D wave equation via boundary triples,"['math.AP', 'math.FA']","['Bernhard Aigner', 'Nathanael Skrepek']","We study the Lagrange representation of the wave equation with generalized Laplacian $\operatorname{div} T \nabla$. We allow the coefficients -- the Young modulus $T$ and the density $ρ$ -- to be $\mathrm{L}^{\infty}$ or even nonlocal operators. Moreover, the Lipschitz boundary of the domain $Ω$ can be split into several parts admitting Dirichlet, Neumann and/or Robin-boundary conditions of displacement, velocity and stress. We show well-posedness of this classical model of the wave equation utilizing boundary triple theory for skew-adjoint operators. In addition we show semi-uniform stability of solutions under slightly stronger assumptions by means of a spectral result."
2505.08595,Isoperimetric inequality with zero magnetic field in doubly connected domains,"['math.AP', 'math.OC', 'math.SP']","['Mrityunjoy Ghosh', 'Ayman Kachmar']","We investigate how the lowest eigenvalue of a magnetic Laplacian depends on the geometry of a planar domain with a disk shaped hole, where the magnetic field is generated by a singular flux. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions on the inner boundary and Neumann boundary conditions on the outer boundary, we show that this eigenvalue is maximized when the domain is an annulus, for a fixed area and magnetic flux. As consequences, we establish geometric inequalities for eigenvalues in settings with both singular and localized magnetic fields. We also propose a conjecture for a general optimality result and establish its validity for large magnetic fluxes."

Johansson', 'Tianyou Chai', 'Tao Yang']","This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where the nonconvex local loss and convex local constraint functions can vary arbitrarily across iterations, and the information of them is privately revealed to each agent at each iteration. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, we propose two distributed bandit online primal--dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources in the one-point and two-point bandit feedback settings, respectively. In nonconvex optimization, finding a globally optimal decision is often NP-hard. As a result, the standard regret metric used in online convex optimization becomes inapplicable. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithms, we use a network regret metric grounded in the first-order optimality condition associated with the variational inequality. We show that the compressed algorithms establish sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results."
2505.08587,Two-Level Sketching Alternating Anderson acceleration for Complex Physics Applications,['math.NA'],"['Nicolás A. Barnafi', 'Massimiliano Lupo Pasini']","We present a novel two-level sketching extension of the Alternating Anderson-Picard (AAP) method for accelerating fixed-point iterations in challenging single- and multi-physics simulations governed by discretized partial differential equations. Our approach combines a static, physics-based projection that reduces the least-squares problem to the most informative field (e.g., via Schur-complement insight) with a dynamic, algebraic sketching stage driven by a backward stability analysis under Lipschitz continuity. We introduce inexpensive estimators for stability thresholds and cache-aware randomized selection strategies to balance computational cost against memory-access overhead. The resulting algorithm solves reduced least-squares systems in place, minimizes memory footprints, and seamlessly alternates between low-cost Picard updates and Anderson mixing. Implemented in Julia, our two-level sketching AAP achieves up to 50% time-to-solution reductions compared to standard Anderson acceleration-without degrading convergence rates-on benchmark problems including Stokes, p-Laplacian, Bidomain, and Navier-Stokes formulations at varying problem sizes. These results demonstrate the method's robustness, scalability, and potential for integration into high-performance scientific computing frameworks. Our implementation is available open-source in the AAP.jl library."

Depending on the energy level where the eigenfunctions concentrate, three distinct dynamical regimes emerge. In the low-energy regime, we show that any invariant measure of the magnetic flow in phase space can be obtained as a semiclassical measure. At the critical energy level, we establish Quantum Unique Ergodicity, together with a quantitative rate of convergence of eigenfunctions to the Liouville measure. In the high-energy regime, we prove a Shnirelman-type result: a density-one subsequence of eigenfunctions becomes equidistributed with respect to the Liouville measure."
2505.08580,When are Morse resolutions polyhedral?,['math.AC'],"['Louis Bu', 'Sara Faridi', 'Iresha Madduwe Hewalage', 'Thiago Holleben', 'Hasan Mahmood', 'Dharm Veer', 'Kyle Wang', 'Scott Wesley']","It is known that the chain complex of a simplex on $q$ vertices can be used to construct a free resolution of any ideal generated by $q$ monomials, and as a direct result, the Betti numbers always have binomial upper bounds, given by the number of faces of a simplex in each dimension.
  It is also known that for most monomials the resolution provided by the simplex is far from minimal. Discrete Morse theory provides an algorithm called \say{Morse matchings} by which faces of the simplex can be removed so that the chain complex on the remaining faces is still a free resolution of the same ideal. An immediate positive effect is an often considerable improvement on the bounds on Betti numbers. A caveat is the loss of the combinatorial structure of the simplex we started with: the output of the Morse matching process is a cell complex with no obvious structure besides an \say{address} for each cell.
  The main question in this paper is: which Morse matchings lead to Morse complexes that are polyhedral cell complexes? We prove that if a monomial ideal is minimally generated by up to four generators, then there is a maximal Morse matching of the simplex such that the resulting cell complex is a polyhedral cell complex. We then give an example of a monomial ideal minimally generated by six generators whose minimal free resolution is supported on a Morse complex and the Morse complex cannot be polyhedral no matter what Morse matching is chosen, and we go further to show that this ideal cannot have any polyhedral minimal free resolution."

Earlier, such approach was realized for the Kolmogorov widths."
2505.08570,On the CM exception to a generalization of the Stéphanois theorem,['math.NT'],['Desirée Gijón Gómez'],"There are two classical theorems related to algebraic values of the j-invariant: Schneider's theorem and the Stéphanois theorem. Schneider's theorem for the j-invariant states that the transcendence degree $\operatorname{trdeg} \mathbb{Q}(τ, j(τ)) \geq 1$ with the sole exception of CM points. In contrast, CM points do not constitute an exception to the Stéphanois theorem, which states $\operatorname{trdeg} \mathbb{Q}(q,j(q))\geq 1$ for the Fourier expansion ($q$-expansion) of the j-invariant, for any $q$. Schneider's theorem has been generalized to higher dimensions, and in particular holds for the Igusa invariants of a genus 2 curve. These functions have Fourier expansions, but a result of Stéphanois type is unknown. In this paper, we find that there are positive dimensional sources of exceptions to the generic behaviour expected in genus 2, and we discuss their relation to CM points. We utilize Humbert singular relations, putting them into the transcendental framework. The computations of the transcendence degree for CM points are conditional to Schanuel's conjecture."

Using the characterization, we propose a nonparametric test to test the symmetry of a distribution. We also develop the jackknife empirical likelihood and the adjusted jackknife empirical likelihood ratio tests. The asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistics are studied. We conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed tests. The simulation results indicate that the jackknife empirical likelihood and adjusted jackknife empirical likelihood ratio tests show better performance than the existing tests. Finally, two real data sets are analysed to illustrate the applicability of the proposed tests."
2505.08563,Convergence and Wave Propagation for a System of Branching Rank-Based Interacting Brownian Particles,"['math.AP', 'math.PR']","['Mete Demircigil', 'Milica Tomasevic']","In this work we study a branching particle system of diffusion processes on the real line interacting through their rank in the system. Namely, each particle follows an independent Brownian motion, but only K $\ge$ 1 particles on the far right are allowed to branch with constant rate, whilst the remaining particles have an additional positive drift of intensity $χ$ > 0. This is the so called Go or Grow hypothesis, which serves as an elementary hypothesis to model cells in a capillary tube moving upwards a chemical gradient. Despite the discontinuous character of the coefficients for the movement of particles and their demographic events, we first obtain the limit behavior of the population as K $\rightarrow$ $\infty$ by weighting the individuals by 1/K. Then, on the microscopic level when K is fixed, we investigate numerically the speed of propagation of the particles and recover a threshold behavior according to the parameter $χ$ consistent with the already known behavior of the limit. Finally, by studying numerically the ancestral lineages we categorize the traveling fronts as pushed or pulled according to the critical parameter $χ$."

We firstly compare several upper bounds on the Frobenius number, assessing their relative tightness through both theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulations. We then explore whether a general upper bound with a worst-case exponent strictly less than quadratic can exist, and formally demonstrate that such an improvement is impossible. These findings offer new insights into the structural properties of established bounds and underscore inherent constraints for future refinement."

For disturbances of bounded magnitude, we provide a semi-definite program whose feasibility implies the existence of a control law and a certificate ensuring safety in the infinite horizon with respect to the worst-case disturbance realization in the uncertainty set. For disturbances with unbounded support, we rely on martingale theory to derive a second semi-definite program whose feasibility provides probabilistic safety guarantees holding joint-in-time over a finite time horizon. We examine several extensions, including (i) encoding of different types of input constraints, (ii) robustification against distributional ambiguity around the true distribution, (iii) design of safety filters, and (iv) extension to general safety specifications such as obstacle avoidance."

Specific to the untouchable set case, the authors state as an open question the existence of untouchable sets of size $2q-1$ and $2q+1$. We answer this question in the affirmative for Desarguesian planes of even order, and provide a construction of untouchable sets of size $2q+1$ in $PG(2,q)$ for $q \equiv 3\pmod{4}$."

Furthermore, the signed graph $Γ$ with $i_{-}(Γ)=\lceil\frac{g}{2}\rceil$ for $g\geq 4$ are given.

2505.08526,Improving Data Fidelity via Diffusion Model-based Correction and Super-Resolution,['math.NA'],"['Wuzhe Xu', 'Yulong Lu', 'Sifan Wang', 'Tong-Rui Liu']","We propose a unified diffusion model-based correction and super-resolution method to enhance the fidelity and resolution of diverse low-quality data through a two-step pipeline. First, the correction step employs a novel enhanced stochastic differential editing technique based on an imbalanced perturbation and denoising process, ensuring robust and effective bias correction at the low-resolution level. The robustness and effectiveness of this approach are validated theoretically and experimentally. Next, the super-resolution step leverages cascaded conditional diffusion models to iteratively refine the corrected data to high-resolution. Numerical experiments on three PDE problems and a climate dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances low-fidelity, low-resolution data by correcting numerical errors and noise while simultaneously improving resolution to recover fine-scale structures."

As SDA advances beyond localized or operator-specific capabilities, there is a growing reliance on in-domain space assets for real-time, distributed sensing and decision-making. This paper investigates the potential of on-orbit collaboration by enabling data sharing among heterogeneous satellites as actuators within a single orbital regime. Using graph-theoretic constructs, we define regions of spatial responsibility via Voronoi tessellations and model communication pathways between actuators using Delaunay triangulation. We apply this framework independently to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO), and Geostationary Orbit (GEO), and analyze each to quantify structural properties relevant to efficient communication, cooperative control, and synchronization for SDA operations with the growth in deployments of space assets."
2505.08518,SPP-SBL: Space-Power Prior Sparse Bayesian Learning for Block Sparse Recovery,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']","['Yanhao Zhang', 'Zhihan Zhu', 'Yong Xia']","The recovery of block-sparse signals with unknown structural patterns remains a fundamental challenge in structured sparse signal reconstruction. By proposing a variance transformation framework, this paper unifies existing pattern-based block sparse Bayesian learning methods, and introduces a novel space power prior based on undirected graph models to adaptively capture the unknown patterns of block-sparse signals. By combining the EM algorithm with high-order equation root-solving, we develop a new structured sparse Bayesian learning method, SPP-SBL, which effectively addresses the open problem of space coupling parameter estimation in pattern-based methods. We further demonstrate that learning the relative values of space coupling parameters is key to capturing unknown block-sparse patterns and improving recovery accuracy. Experiments validate that SPP-SBL successfully recovers various challenging structured sparse signals (e.g., chain-structured signals and multi-pattern sparse signals) and real-world multi-modal structured sparse signals (images, audio), showing significant advantages in recovery accuracy across multiple metrics."

For linear systems, we derive explicit decay rates, which depend on boundary control parameters, grid resolutions, and the statistical properties of the random inputs. Theoretical decay rates are verified through numerical examples, including boundary stabilization of the linear wave equations and linearized shallow-water flows with random perturbations. We also present the decay rates for a nonlinear example and for the linearized Saint-Venant system with source terms."

This particular formulation incorporates two important features: a mushy region and turbulent transport within the liquid phase. While our approach bears similarities to porous media equations, it differs in a crucial aspect. Instead of using the typical framework for such equations, we have chosen to work within an L2 space. This choice is motivated by the nature of the operator that characterizes the turbulent noise in our model. The L2 space provides a more natural and appropriate setting for handling this specific operator, allowing us to better capture and analyze the turbulent transport phenomena in the liquid phase of the Stefan problem."

The DGP pseudoalgebra with some compatibility conditions is proved to be closed under tensor product. Furthermore, the universal enveloping $H$-pseudoalgebras of DGP pseudoalgebras are constructed by a $\mathcal{P}$-triple.

2505.08491,Numerical Solution of Mixed-Dimensional PDEs Using a Neural Preconditioner,['math.NA'],"['Nunzio Dimola', 'Nicola Rares Franco', 'Paolo Zunino']","Mixed-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) are characterized by coupled operators defined on domains of varying dimensions and pose significant computational challenges due to their inherent ill-conditioning. Moreover, the computational workload increases considerably when attempting to accurately capture the behavior of the system under significant variations or uncertainties in the low-dimensional structures such as fractures, fibers, or vascular networks, due to the inevitable necessity of running multiple simulations. In this work, we present a novel preconditioning strategy that leverages neural networks and unsupervised operator learning to design an efficient preconditioner specifically tailored to a class of 3D-1D mixed-dimensional PDEs. The proposed approach is capable of generalizing to varying shapes of the 1D manifold without retraining, making it robust to changes in the 1D graph topology. Moreover, thanks to convolutional neural networks, the neural preconditioner can adapt over a range of increasing mesh resolutions of the discrete problem, enabling us to train it on low resolution problems and deploy it on higher resolutions. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the preconditioner in accelerating convergence in iterative solvers, demonstrating its appeal and limitations over traditional methods. This study lays the groundwork for applying neural network-based preconditioning techniques to a broader range of coupled multi-physics systems."

We establish unique identifiability results for simultaneously determining several key parameters, including the wave/diffusion speed $c$, causal sources $f$ and $h$, and conductivity tensor $σ$, under generic conditions. As a central application, we provide a complete resolution to the joint reconstruction problem in thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography (TAT/PAT), proving for the first time that both the initial pressure distribution $f$ and the heterogeneous sound speed $c$ can be uniquely and simultaneously determined from just a single, passive, partial boundary observation. We develop a novel, state-of-the-art framework that exploits the full spectral content of the wave field, combining both low-frequency and high-frequency asymptotics.

Finally, we apply these results together with microlocal analytic continuation and a layer stripping argument to a problem from seismic inversion to prove the injectivity of a linearized operator in the analytic setting. It is the use of wave packet techniques that allows us to give the precise relation how the FIOs under consideration transform the analytic wavefront set, whereas the explicit analytic parametrix comes from a reformulation of the parametrix construction of Hadamard and Hörmander."

In this paper, we introduce a rigorous and practical method to compute a guaranteed lower bound for the reach of a submanifold described as the common zero-set of finitely many smooth functions, not necessarily polynomials. Our algorithm uses techniques from numerically verified proofs and is particularly suitable for high-performance parallel implementations.
  We illustrate the utility of this method through several applications. Of special note is a novel algorithm for computing the homology groups of planar curves, achieved by constructing a cubical complex that deformation retracts onto the curve--an approach potentially extendable to higher-dimensional manifolds. Additional applications include an improved comparison inequality between intrinsic and extrinsic distances for submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^N$, lower bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on algebraic varieties and explicit bounds on how much smooth varieties can be deformed without changing their diffeomorphism type."

Martínez', 'Michał Szwej', 'Mark Wildon']","We present a bijective proof of a family of $q$-binomial identities -- including Stanley's identity -- each equivalent to the $q$-Pfaff--Saalschütz identity. Our proof is far shorter than those previously known and is the first in which $q$-binomial coefficients are interpreted as counting subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q$-vector spaces. As a corollary, we obtain a new multiplication rule for quantum binomial coefficients and hence a new presentation of Lusztig's integral form $U_{\mathbb{Z}[q, q^{-1}]}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of the Cartan subalgebra of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$."
2505.08408,A three-term Polak-Ribière-Polyak conjugate gradient method for vector optimization,['math.OC'],"['Guangxuan Lin', 'Shouqiang Du']","A novel three-term Polak-Ribière-Polyak conjugate gradient method is proposed for solving vector optimization problems. It should be emphasized that this is the first extension of three-term conjugate gradient methods from scalar optimization to vector optimization. The method can consistently generate a sufficient descent direction independent of line search procedures and without modifying the conjugate parameters. This result improves upon the corresponding conclusions in SIAM J. Optim. 28, 2690-2720 (2018), J. Optim. Theory Appl. 204,13 (2025) and Optim. Methods Softw. 28, 725-754 (2025). Based on a new Wolfe-type line search, the global convergence of the proposed scheme is established without imposing restrictions such as self-adjusting strategies, regular restarts and convexity assumptions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the favourable performance of the proposed method."

In particular, we obtain some non-expected automorphisms of order 3 that appear for the quotient modular curves when the Atkin-Lehner involution $w_{25}$ belongs to the quotient modular group, such automorphisms are not necessarily defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. As a consequence of the results, we obtain the full automorphism group of the quotient modular curve $X_0^*(N^2)$, for sufficiently large $N$."
2505.08394,Probability measures on families of partitions related to harmonic analysis on big wreath products,"['math.RT', 'math.CO', 'math.PR']",['Eugene Strahov'],We construct generalized regular representations of the wreath product of a compact group with the infinite symmetric group. The characters of these representations are determined by probability measures on families of partitions called the $z$-measures for the wreath product of a compact group with the symmetric group in the present paper. Our main result is an explicit formula for these $z$-measures which holds true for an arbitrary compact group. The result enables us to describe the spectral measures of the generalized regular representations of big wreath products.
2505.08393,Input-to-state type Stability for Simplified Fluid-Particle Interaction System,"['math.AP', 'math.OC']",['Zhuo Xu'],"In this paper, we study the well-posedness and the input-to-state type stability of a one-dimensional fluid-particle interaction system. A distinctive feature, not yet considered in the ISS literature, is that our system involves a free boundary. More precisely, the fluid is described by the viscous Burgers equation, and the motion of the particle obeys Newton second law. The point mass is subject to both a feedback control and an open-loop control. We first establish the well-posedness of the system for any open-loop input in the L2(0, infinity) space. Assuming the input also belongs to the L1(0,infinity) space, we prove that the particle's position remains uniformly bounded and that the system is input-to-state type stable. The proof is based on the construction of a Lyapunov functional derived from a special test function."
2505.08391,Block-Decomposition for 3-Parameter Persistence Modules,"['math.AT', 'math.RT']",['Siheng Yi'],"In 2020, Cochoy and Oudot got the necessary and sufficient condition of the block-decomposition of 2-parameter persistence modules $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \textbf{Vec}_{\Bbbk}$. And in 2024, Lebovici, Lerch and Oudot resolve the problem of block-decomposability for multi-parameter persistence modules. Following the approach of Cochoy and Oudot's proof of block-decomposability for 2-parameter persistence modules, we rediscuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for the block decomposition of the 3-parameter persistence modules $\mathbb{R}^3 \to \textbf{Vec}_{\Bbbk}$. Our most important contribution is to generalize the strong exactness of 2-parameter persistence modules to the case of 3-parameter persistence modules. What's more, the generalized method allows us to understand why there is no block decomposition in general persistence modules to some extent."
2505.08387,The Lax-Wendroff theorem for Patankar-type methods applied to hyperbolic conservation laws,['math.NA'],"['Janina Bender', 'Thomas Izgin', 'Philipp Öffner', 'Davide Torlo']","For hyperbolic conservation laws, the famous Lax-Wendroff theorem delivers sufficient conditions for the limit of a convergent numerical method to be a weak (entropy) solution. This theorem is a fundamental result, and many investigations have been done to verify its validity for finite difference, finite volume, and finite element schemes, using either explicit or implicit linear time-integration methods. Recently, the use of modified Patankar (MP) schemes as time-integration methods for the discretization of hyperbolic conservation laws has gained increasing interest. These schemes are unconditionally conservative and positivity-preserving and only require the solution of a linear system. However, MP schemes are by construction nonlinear, which is why the theoretical investigation of these schemes is more involved. We prove an extension of the Lax-Wendroff theorem for the class of MP methods. This is the first extension of the Lax--Wendroff theorem to nonlinear time integration methods with just an additional hypothesis on the total time variation boundedness of the numerical solutions. We provide some numerical simulations that validate the theoretical observations."

Our results provide a new algebraic framework for topological data analysis, which is more refined compared to directly computing the homology groups of the filtration of simplicial complexes. Furthermore, the stability results for persistence minimal Lie models ensure that our model is well-founded."

We consider discrete-time partially observable stochastic linear systems and provide a robustification of the standard LQG against distributional uncertainties on the process and measurement noise. Our distributionally robust formulation specifies the admissible perturbations by defining a relative entropy based ambiguity set individually for each time step along a finite-horizon trajectory, and minimizes the worst-case cost across all admissible distributions. We prove that the optimal control policy is still linear, as in standard LQG, and derive a computational scheme grounded on iterative best response that provably converges to the set of saddle points. Finally, we consider the case of endogenous uncertainty captured via decision-dependent ambiguity sets and we propose an approximation scheme based on dynamic programming."

The main objective of this thesis is to exhibit homotopical Dold-Kan correspondences in the context of test categories. More precisely, we introduce, following Grothendieck, a functor generalizing simplicial homology, from the category of abelian presheaves over any small category to the derived category of abelian groups in non-negative homological degree. We then look for conditions ensuring that this functor induces an equivalence of categories, after localization by the class of morphisms whose image in the derived category is an isomorphism. Generally, there exists a second class of weak equivalences, arising from the theory of test categories, on the category of abelian presheaves, and we call Whitehead Categories those small categories for which these two classes coincide, generalizing the case of $Δ$. We show that important examples of test categories are Whitehead categories, notably Joyal's category $Θ$. We construct, for any Whitehead local test category, a model category structure on its category of abelian presheaves with the weak equivalences mentioned above. We then prove that for any Whitehead test category, the homology functor does induce an equivalence between the localized categories. We obtain this way many examples of homotopical Dold-Kan correspondences, including, among others, the category $Θ$."

The representative agent adjusts the dynamics of an Itô diffusion via one-sided singular stochastic control, aiming to maximize a long-term average expected profit criterion. The mean-field interaction is of scalar type through the stationary distribution of the population. Due to the presence of uncertainty, the problem involves the study of a stochastic (zero-sum) game, where the decision maker chooses the ""best"" singular control policy, while the adversarial player selects the ""worst"" probability measure. Using a constructive approach, we prove existence and uniqueness of a stationary mean-field equilibrium. Finally, we present an example of mean-field optimal extraction of natural resources under uncertainty and we analyze the impact of uncertainty on the mean-field equilibrium."
2505.08304,Global existence for a Leibenson type equation with reaction on Riemannian manifolds,['math.AP'],"['Giulia Meglioli', 'Francescantonio Oliva', 'Francesco Petitta']","We show a global existence result for a doubly nonlinear porous medium type equation of the form $$u_t = Δ_p u^m +\, u^q$$ on a complete and non-compact Riemannian manifold $M$ of infinite volume. Here, for $1<p<N$, we assume $m(p-1)\ge1$, $m>1$ and $q>m(p-1)$. In particular, under the assumptions that $M$ supports the Sobolev inequality, we prove that a solution for such a problem exists globally in time provided $q>m(p-1)+\frac pN$ and the initial datum is small enough; namely, we establish an explicit bound on the $L^\infty$ norm of the solution at all positive times, in terms of the $L^1$ norm of the data. Under the additional assumption that a Poincaré-type inequality also holds in $M$, we can establish the same result in the larger interval, i.e. $q>m(p-1)$. This result has no Euclidean counterpart, as it differs entirely from the case of a bounded Euclidean domain due to the fact that $M$ is non-compact and has infinite measure."

2505.08280,Extremising eigenvalues of the GJMS operators in a fixed conformal class,"['math.DG', 'math.AP', 'math.SP']","['Emmanuel Humbert', 'Romain Petrides', 'Bruno Premoselli']","Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$. If $s$ is a positive integer satisfying $2s<n$, we let $P_g^s$ be the GJMS operator of order $2s$ in $M$. We investigate in this paper the extremal values taken by fixed eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ as $h$ runs through the whole conformal class $[g]$. These extremal values -- that we call throughout the paper \emph{conformal eigenvalues} -- are conformal invariants of $(M,g)$ and optimisers for these problems, when they exist, are known to not be smooth metrics in general. In this paper we develop a general framework that allows us to address the the existence theory for extremals of conformal eigenvalues. We define and investigate eigenvalues for singular conformal metrics, that we call \emph{generalised eigenvalues}. We develop a new variational framework for renormalised eigenvalues of any index over the set of admissible (singular) conformal factors: we obtain semi-continuity results and Euler-Lagrange equations for local extremals. Using this framework we prove, under mild assumptions on $(M,g)$ and $s$, several new (non)-existence results for extremals of renormalised eigenvalues over $[g]$. These include, among other results, a maximisation result for negative eigenvalues, the minimisation of the principal eigenvalue of $P_g^s$ and the analysis of the conformal eigenvalues of the round sphere $(\mathbb{S}^n, g_0)$. We also establish a strong connection between the existence of optimisers and (nodal) solutions of prescribed $Q$-curvature equations. Our analysis allows any order $s \ge 1$ and allows $P_g^s$ to have kernel. Previous results only covered the cases $s=1,2$ and $k=1,2$. Our work strongly generalises these results to any $s \ge 1$ and to eigenvalues of any order."

Given a family of $k$-uniform families $\mathscr H$, Balogh, Clemen and Lidický recently introduced the problem to determine the maximum codegree squared sum ${\rm co}_2(\cal F)$ over all $\mathscr H$-free $\cal F$. In the present paper, we consider the families which has as forbidden configurations all pairs of sets with intersection sizes less than $t$,
  that is, the well-known $t$-intersecting families. We prove the following Erdős--Ko--Rado Theorem in $\ell_2$-norm, which confirms a conjecture of Brooks and Linz.
  Let $t,k,n$ be positive integers such that $t\leq k\leq n$. If a family $\mathcal F\subseteq \binom{[n]}{k}$ is $t$-intersecting, then for $n\ge (t+1)(k-t+1)$, we have \[{\rm co}_2(\cal F)\le {\binom{n-t}{k-t}}(t+(n-k+1)(k-t)),\] equality holds if and only if $\mathcal{F}=\{F\in {\binom{[n]}{k}}: T\subset F\}$ for some $t$-subset $T$ of $[n]$.
  In addition, we prove a Frankl--Hilton--Milner Theorem in $\ell_2$-norm for $t\ge 2$, and a generalized Turán result, i.e., we determine the maximum number of copies of tight path of length 2 in $t$-intersecting families."

Originally introduced by Laffey and West for matrices over fields, this notion is here extended to broader algebraic settings. We first show that in division rings, polynomial commutators can generate maximal subfields and even the entire ring as an algebra. In the matrix setting, we prove that matrices similar to ones with zero diagonal are polynomial commutators, and under mild assumptions, every matrix can be written as a product of at most three such commutators. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the matrix algebra can be decomposed as the sum of its center and the linear span of all polynomial commutators. Using the theory of rational identities in division rings, we also exhibit that the trace of a polynomial commutator in the matrix ring can be nonzero in noncommutative cases. Lastly, we explore the size of polynomial commutators via matrix norms."

The application of state-multiplicative noise as a mean of control is far more limited then the use of standard determinis?tic gains. Nevertheless, so called Stochastic Anti Resonance (SAR) with state-multiplicative noise based control, do arise in a variety of situations such as in engineering applications, physics modelling, bi?ology, and models of visuo-motor tasks. Linear Matrix Inequalities based conditions from recent publications are reviewed, that character?ize stochastic stability of such nonlinear systems applying SAR. While those results dealt with systems that are, apriori, modelled using sec?tor bounded nonlinearities, we demonstrate that more general systems that can be approximated as such, can be also controlled using SAR."

2505.08214,Adaptive and hybrid reduced order models to mitigate Kolmogorov barrier in a multiscale kinetic transport equation,"['math.NA', 'physics.comp-ph']","['Tianyu Jin', 'Zhichao Peng', 'Yang Xiang']","In this work, we develop reduced order models (ROMs) to predict solutions to a multiscale kinetic transport equation with a diffusion limit under the parametric setting. When the underlying scattering effect is not sufficiently strong, the system governed by this equation exhibits transport-dominated behavior. Suffering from the Kolmogorov barrier for transport-dominant problems, classical linear ROMs may become inefficient in this regime. To address this issue, we first develop a piecewise linear ROM by introducing a novel goal-oriented adaptive time partitioning strategy. To avoid local over-refinement or under-refinement, we propose an adaptive coarsening and refinement strategy that remains robust with various initial empirical partitions. Additionally, for problems where a local linear approximation is not sufficiently efficient, we further develop a hybrid ROM, which combines autoencoder-based nonlinear ROMs and piecewise linear ROMs. Compared to previous autoencoder-based ROMs, this hybridized method reduces the offline autoencoder's training cost by only applying it to time intervals that are adaptively identified as the most challenging. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches successfully predict full-order solutions at unseen parameter values with both efficiency and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the Kolmogorov barrier for multiscale kinetic transport problems with the coexistence of both transport- and diffusion-dominant behaviors."

For fixed $r$, the sets $\mathcal{U}_{r, w}$ form an open cover of $X(β)$. We conjecture that $\mathcal{U}_{r,w}$ is given by the nonvanishing of some cluster variables in a single cluster for the cluster structure on $\mathbb{C}[X(β)]$ and that $\mathcal{U}_{r,w}$ admits a cluster structure given by freezing these variables. Moreover, we show that $\mathcal{U}_{r, w}$ is always isomorphic to the product of two braid varieties, and we conjecture that this isomorphism is quasi-cluster. In some important special cases, we are able to prove our conjectures."

We consider the case when the far-field state as a right-end state of 2-Hugoniot shock curve belongs to the subsonic region or transonic curve. We employ the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, to prove that if the strength of viscous shock wave is small and sufficiently away from the boundary, and if a initial perturbation is small, then the solution asymptotically converges to the viscous shock up to a dynamical shift. We also prove that the speed of time-dependent shift decays to zero as times goes to infinity, the shifted viscous shock still retains its original profile time-asymptotically.
  Since the outflow problem in the Lagrangian mass coordinate leads to a free boundary value problem due to the absence of a boundary condition for the fluid density, we consider the problem in the Eulerian coordinate instead. Although the $a$-contraction method is technically more complicated in the Eulerian coordinate than in the Lagrangian one, this provides a more favorable framework by avoiding the difficulty arising from a free boundary."
2505.08169,Characterizations of ellipsoids by means of the strong intersection property,['math.MG'],['E. Morales-Amaya'],"Let $E_1,E_2\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be two homothetic solid ellipsoids, $n\geq 3$, with center at the origin $O$ of a system coordinates of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $E_1\subset E_2$. Then there exists a $O$-symmetric ellipsoid $E_3$ such that $E_3$ is homothetic to $E_1$ and, for all $x\in \partial E_2$, there exists an hyperplano $Π(x)$, $O\in Π(x)$, such that the relation \begin{eqnarray} S(E_1,x)\cap S(E_1,-x)= Π(x) \cap E_3. \end{eqnarray} holds, where $S(E_1,x)$ and $S(E_1,-x)$ are the supporting cones of $E_1$ with apex $x$ and $-x$, respectively.
  In this work we prove that aforesaid condition characterizes the ellipsoid. In fact, we prove that if $K,S, G\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are three convex bodies, $n\geq 3$, $O\in K$, $K\subset G\subset S$ and $G$ strictly convex and, for all $x\in \partial S$, there exists $y\in \partial S$, $O$ in the line defined by $x,y$, an hyperplane $Π(x)$, $O\in Π(x)$, such that the relation \begin{eqnarray} S(K,x)\cap S(K,y)= Π(x) \cap \partial G. \end{eqnarray} holds, where $S(K,x)$ and $S(K,y)$ are the supporting cones of $K$ with apex $x$ and $y$, respectively, then $G,K$ and $S$ are $O$-symmetric homothetic ellipsoids.
  In this case, we say that the convex body $K$ has the 'strong intersection property' relative to $O$ and $S$ and with 'associated' body $G$. Thus our main result affirm that if the convex body $K$ has the strong intersection property relative to $O$ and $S$ and with associated strictly convex body $G$, then $K,S$ and $G$ are concentric homothetic ellipsoids."

2505.08144,Dyadic Factorization and Efficient Inversion of Sparse Positive Definite Matrices,"['math.NA', 'stat.CO']","['Michał Kos', 'Krzysztof Podgórski', 'Hanqing Wu']","In inverting large sparse matrices, the key difficulty lies in effectively exploiting sparsity during the inversion process. One well-established strategy is the nested dissection, which seeks the so-called sparse Cholesky factorization. We argue that the matrices for which such factors can be found are characterized by a hidden dyadic sparsity structure. This paper builds on that idea by proposing an efficient approach for inverting such matrices. The method consists of two independent steps: the first packs the matrix into a dyadic form, while the second performs a sparse (dyadic) Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of the packed matrix.
  The novel packing procedure works by recovering block-tridiagonal structures, focusing on aggregating terms near the diagonal using the $l_1$-norm, which contrasts with traditional methods that prioritize minimizing bandwidth, i.e. the $l_\infty$-norm. The algorithm performs particularly well for matrices that can be packed into banded or dyadic forms which are moderately dense. Due to the properties of $l_1$-norm, the packing step can be applied iteratively to reconstruct the hidden dyadic structure, which corresponds to the detection of separators in the nested dissection method.
  We explore the algebraic properties of dyadic-structured matrices and present an algebraic framework that allows for a unified mathematical treatment of both sparse factorization and efficient inversion of factors. For matrices with a dyadic structure, we introduce an optimal inversion algorithm and evaluate its computational complexity.
  The proposed inversion algorithm and core algebraic operations for dyadic matrices are implemented in the R package DyadiCarma, utilizing Rcpp and RcppArmadillo for high-performance computing. An independent R-based matrix packing module, supported by C++ code, is also provided."

We consider each customer as a vertex of a weighted graph, and the edge weights are given by the distances between the vectors corresponding to the $(R,F,M)$-scores of the customers. We design a procedure to build a reduced graph with fewer vertices and edges, and the customer segmentation is obtained by solving the max-$k$-cut for this reduced graph. We prove that the optimal objective function values of the original and the reduced problems are equal. Additionally, we show that an optimal solution to the original problem can be easily obtained from an optimal solution to the reduced problem, which provides an advantage in dealing with computational complexity in large instances. Applying our methodology to a real customer dataset allowed us to identify distinct behaviors between groups and analyze their meaning and value from a business perspective."

2505.08131,On the existence of minimally tough graphs having large minimum degrees,['math.CO'],['Morteza Hasanvand'],"Kriesel conjectured that every minimally $1$-tough graph has a vertex with degree precisely $2$. Katona and Varga (2018) proposed a generalized version of this conjecture which says that every minimally $t$-tough graph has a vertex with degree precisely $\lceil 2t\rceil$, where $t$ is a positive real number. This conjecture has been recently verified for several families of graphs. For example, Ma, Hu, and Yang (2023) confirmed it for claw-free minimally $3/2$-tough graphs. Recently, Zheng and Sun (2024) disproved this conjecture by constructing a family of $4$-regular graphs with toughness approaching to $1$.
  In this paper, we disprove this conjecture for planar graphs and their line graphs. In particular, we construct an infinite family of minimally $t$-tough non-regular claw-free graphs with minimum degree close to thrice their toughness. This construction not only disproves a renewed version of Generalized Kriesel's Conjecture on non-regular graphs proposed by Zheng and Sun (2024), it also gives a supplement to a result due to Ma, Hu, and Yang (2023) who proved that every minimally $t$-tough claw-free graph with $t\ge 2$ has a vertex of degree at most $3t+ \lceil (t-5)/3\rceil$. Moreover, we conjecture that there is not a fixed constant $c$ such that every minimally $t$-tough graph has minimum degree at most $\lceil c t \rceil$."

Kasuya shows that if the action $φ:\R^k \to \mathrm{Aut}(\R^m)$ is semisimple then any symplectic solvmanifold $(Γ\backslash G, ω)$ satisfies the hard-Lefschetz condition for any symplectic form. In this article, we prove the converse in the case $k = 1$ and $G$ completely solvable: no symplectic form on such a solvmanifold satisfies the hard-Lefschetz condition if $φ$ is not semisimple; moreover, we show that the failure occurs either at degree $1$ or at degree $2$ in cohomology, depending on the spectrum of the differential of the action $φ$. This result is achieved through a detailed analysis of the cohomology groups $H^1(\g)$, $H^2(\g)$, $H^{2n-2}(\g)$, $H^{2n-1}(\g)$ of the Lie algebra $\g$ of such Lie groups. Among other things, this analysis yields useful representatives for each cohomology class corresponding to any symplectic form on $\g$, allowing the most delicate cases to be reduced to a straightforward computation. We also construct lattices for many of the Lie groups under consideration, thereby exhibiting examples of symplectic solvmanifolds of completely solvable Lie groups failing to have the hard-Lefschetz property for any symplectic form."

We prove global convergence of our algorithm, assuming that the mapping of the quasi-variational inequality is either single-valued and continuous or it is set-valued maximally monotone. Quasi-variational inequalities serve as a framework for several equilibrium problems, and we apply our algorithm to an important example in the field of economics, namely the Walrasian equilibrium problem formulated as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem.

Next, assuming $M$ has bounded geometry (not necessarily compact), and given critical points with $\varepsilon^{-1}\mathcal{Y}_{\varepsilon}(\nabla_{\varepsilon}, Φ_{\varepsilon})$ uniformly bounded, we show that as $\varepsilon\to 0$, the energy measures $\varepsilon^{-1}e_{\varepsilon}(\nabla_{\varepsilon}, Φ_{\varepsilon}) vol_{g}$ converge subsequentially to \[ |h|^2 vol_g + \sum_{x \in S}Θ(x)δ_{x}, \] where $h$ is an $L^2$ harmonic $1$-form, $S$ a finite set and each $Θ(x)$ equals the energy of a finite collection of $\mathcal{Y}_{1}$-critical points on $\mathbb{R}^3$.

The investigation focuses on a traffic corridor with a bottleneck subject to the capacity drop phenomenon. The optimization criterion is a linear combination of the expected value and standard deviation of average travel time, with traffic flow dynamics following the kinematic wave model (Lighthill, 1955; Richards, 1956). We develop two complementary models to optimally set variable speed limits: In the first model, daily peak traffic demand is conceptualized as a stochastic variable, and the resulting model is solved through a three-stage optimization algorithm. The second model is based on deterministic demand, instead modeling bottleneck capacity as a stochastic process using a stochastic differential equation (SDE). The practical applicability of both approaches is demonstrated through numerical examples with empirically calibrated data."

The model considers types of goods and employs a Markov chain to capture probabilistic regime transitions, coupled with a multidimensional Brownian motion representing stochastic demand dynamics. The production and inventory cost optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic cost functional, with the solution characterized by a regime-dependent system of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical solutions to the PDE system are computed using a monotone iteration algorithm, enabling quantitative analysis. Sensitivity analysis and model risk evaluation illustrate the effects of regime-dependent volatility, holding costs, and discount factors, revealing the conservative bias of regime-switching models when compared to static alternatives. Practical implications include optimizing production strategies under fluctuating economic conditions and exploring future extensions such as correlated Brownian dynamics, non-quadratic cost functions, and geometric inventory frameworks. This research bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and practical applications, offering a robust framework for dynamic production planning."

Suppose that each vertex $v$ has its own private list $L(v)$ of allowed colours such that $|L(v)|\ge \mbox{deg}(v)+1$. We prove that if $G$ is connected and its maximum degree $Δ$ is at least $3$, then for any two proper $L$-colourings in which at least one vertex can be recoloured, one can be transformed to the other by a sequence of $O(|V(G)|^2)$ recolouring steps. We also show that reducing the list-size of a single vertex $w$ to $\mbox{deg}(w)$ can lead to situations where the space of proper $L$-colourings is `shattered'. Our results can be interpreted as showing a sharp phase transition in the Glauber dynamics of proper $L$-colourings of graphs.

  We study the geometric properties of such sets and, in particular, establish an isoperimetric-type inequality relating the perimeter and area of a region bounded by a simple smooth convex closed curve (an oval) $\mathcal{O}$: \[ L_{\mathcal{O}}^2 - 4πA_{\mathcal{O}} \geqslant 4π|A_{\mathcal{P}_k}| + 2π|A_{Ω_{\mathcal{O},k}}|, \] where $L_{\mathcal{O}}$ denotes the length (perimeter) of $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{O}}$ is the area of the region enclosed by $\mathcal{O}$, $A_{\mathcal{P}_k}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$th Order Preserving Set $\mathcal{P}_k$, and $A_{Ω_{\mathcal{O},k}}$ is the oriented area of the associated $k$th Order Midpoint Set $Ω_{\mathcal{O},k}$. Moreover, we characterize the equality case: the inequality becomes an equality if and only if every equiangular circumscribed $k$-gon around $\mathcal{O}$ is a~regular $k$-gon with its center of mass located at the Steiner point of $\mathcal{O}$."

We also give algebraic relations that hold between entries of multiple adjacent diamonds of such a frieze. Furthermore, we define a plane Heronian frieze, and establish some more determinant vanishing equalities for the entries of a plane Heronian frieze arising from a cyclic $n$-gon, where $n$ is a positive integer divisible by $4$."
2505.08014,A dual characterisation of simple and subdirectly-irreducible temporal Heyting algebras,"['math.LO', 'cs.LO']",['David Quinn Alvarez'],"We establish an Esakia duality for the categories of temporal Heyting algebras and temporal Esakia spaces. This includes a proof of contravariant equivalence and a congruence/filter/closed-upset correspondence. We then study two notions of « reachability » on the relevant spaces/frames and show their equivalence in the finite case. We use these notions of reachability to give both lattice-theoretic and dual order-topological characterisations of simple and subdirectly-irreducible temporal Heyting algebras. Finally, we apply our duality results to prove the relational and algebraic finite model property for the temporal Heyting calculus. This, in conjunction with the proven characterisations, allows us to prove a relational completeness result that combines finiteness and the frame property dual to subdirect-irreducibility, giving us a class of finite, well-understood frames for the logic."
2505.08010,On equality of the $L^\infty$ norm of the gradient under the Hausdorff and Lebesgue measure,"['math.CA', 'math.FA']",['Ze-An Ng'],"Let $Ω$ be an open subset of $\mathbb R^n$, and let $f: Ω\to \mathbb R$ be differentiable $\mathcal H^k$-almost everywhere, for some nonnegative integer $k < n$, where $\mathcal H^k$ denotes the $k$=dimensional Hausdorff measure. We show that $\|\nabla f\|_{L^\infty (\mathcal H^k)} = \|\nabla f\|_{L^\infty(\mathcal H^n)}.$ We deduce that convergence in the Sobolev space $W^{1, \infty}$ preserves everywhere differentiability. As a further corollary, we deduce that the class $C^1 (Ω)$ of continuously differentiable functions is closed in $W^{1, \infty}(Ω)$."
2505.08001,Auslander regularity of completed rings of $p$-adic differential operators,"['math.NT', 'math.RA', 'math.RT']",['Andreas Bode'],We prove that any smooth rigid analytic variety $X$ admits an affinoid covering $\{U_i\}$ such that the Banach algebras involved in the Fréchet--Stein presentation of the completed ring of differential operators D-cap$(U_i)$ are Auslander regular for each $i$. We use this result to prove projection formulae and adjunction results for coadmissible D-cap-modules.
2505.07992,A decomposition structure of resonance graphs that are daisy cubes,['math.CO'],"['Zhongyuan Che', 'Zhibo Chen']","It has recently been shown in [\emph{Discrete Appl. Math.} {\bf 366} (2025) 75--85] that the resonance graph of a plane elementary bipartite graph $G$ is a daisy cube if and only if $G$ is peripherally 2-colorable. Let $G$ be a peripherally 2-colorable graph and $R(G)$ be its resonance graph. We provide a decomposition structure of $R(G)$ with respect to an arbitrary finite face of $G$ together with a proper labelling for the vertex set of $R(G)$. An algorithm is obtained to generate a proper labelling for all perfect matchings of $G$ which induces an isometric embedding of $R(G)$ as a daisy cube into an $n$-dimensional hypercube, where $n$ is the isometric dimension of $R(G)$. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to generate such a proper labelling for all perfect matchings of any plane weakly elementary bipartite graph whose each elementary component with more than two vertices is peripherally 2-colorable. We also compare two binary codings for all perfect matchings of $G$ which induces distinct structures on $R(G)$: one as a daisy cube and the other as a finite distributive, respectively."
2505.07987,Commutator calculus and symbolic differentiation of matrix functions,"['math.AP', 'math-ph']",['Michal Bathory'],"We propose a functional calculus which allows one to apply functions to the matrix anti-commutator/commutator operator. The calculus is introduced in a straightforward manner if the operators act on symmetric matrices, and it leads to a coordinate-free version of Daleckii--Krein formula. In this sense, the proposed calculus provides symbolic formulae for the derivatives of matrix-valued functions that are explicit and easy to use. We discuss several applications of the newly introduced calculus in continuum mechanics (Hencky logarithmic strain, objective rates, spin tensors, viscoelastic fluids) and in the theory of partial differential equations."
2505.07982,Real state transfer on edge perturbed graphs with generalized clusters,"['math.CO', 'quant-ph']",['Hiranmoy Pal'],"We study the existence of real state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs containing generalized clusters, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be either the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian matrix, or the signless Laplacian matrix of an associated weighted graph. This framework provides a unified approach for constructing new graphs that exhibit perfect real state transfer, building on known examples with this property. A central observation is that the evolution of certain quantum states depends solely on the local structure of the underlying graph. In particular, we construct an infinite family of graphs with maximum valency five that exhibit perfect pair state transfer-under each of the aforementioned matrices-between the same pair of states at the same time, despite being non-regular. Additionally, we identify instances of perfect pair state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, blow-up graphs, and related structures. We also examine various graph operations-such as the sequential join, complement, Cartesian product, lexicographic product, and corona product-that generate new families of graphs exhibiting perfect real state transfer with respect to all three choices of the Hamiltonian."
2505.07965,Defects in weighted graphs and Commutators,['math.CO'],"['Harish Kishnani', 'Amit Kulshrestha']","Let $R$ be a commutative ring. In \cite{KK_2025(1)}, the authors introduced $R$-weighted graphs as a tool for studying commutators in groups and Lie algebras. These graphs are equivalent to a system of balance equations, and their consistent labelings correspond to solutions of this system of balance equations. In this article, we apply these ideas in the case when $R$ is a field $F$. We focus on $F$-weighted graphs with four vertices and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of consistent labelings on them. A notion of defects in weighted graphs is introduced for this purpose. We prove that defects in weighted graphs prevent Lie brackets from being surjective onto its derived Lie subalgebra. Similarly, these defects prevent certain elements in the commutator subgroup of a nilpotent group of class $2$ from being a commutator. As an application of our techniques, we prove that for a Lie algebra $L$ whose dimension over $F$ is at most countable and the dimension of its derived subalgebra $L'$ is at most $3$, the Lie bracket is surjective onto $L'$. We provide a counterexample when $\dim(L') = 4$. We also characterize commutators among $L$' for the Lie algebras $L$ with $\dim(L/Z(L))\leq 4$."

In this paper, we propose a simplified framework for analyzing the potential of neural networks to simulate differential equations based on the properties of the equations themselves. We apply this framework to the Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard systems, presenting both theoretical analysis and practical implementations. We then conduct numerical experiments on toy problems to validate the framework's efficacy in accurately capturing the desired properties of these systems and numerically estimate relevant convergence properties."
2505.07958,Laws of Large Numbers for Information Resolution,"['math.PR', 'math.ST']",['Daniel Raban'],"Laws of large numbers establish asymptotic guarantees for recovering features of a probability distribution using independent samples. We introduce a framework for proving analogous results for recovery of the $σ$-field of a probability space, interpreted as information resolution--the granularity of measurable events given by comparison to our samples. Our main results show that, under iid sampling, the Borel $σ$-field in $\mathbb R^d$ and in more general metric spaces can be recovered in the strongest possible mode of convergence. We also derive finite-sample $L^1$ bounds for uniform convergence of $σ$-fields on $[0,1]^d$.
  We illustrate the use of our framework with two applications: constructing randomized solutions to the Skorokhod embedding problem, and analyzing the loss of variants of random forests for regression."
2505.07907,An entropy for Boolean independence,['math.PR'],['Kewei Pan'],"In this article, we aim to define a Boolean entropy notion parallel to the framework of free entropy proposed by Voiculescu. Motivated by the work of Lenczewski and the work of Cébron & Gillers, we mainly investigated two random matrix models (the Gaussian Symmetric Block model and the Conditioned GUE model), in which asymptotic Boolean independence appears. We showed a large deviation principle for both models. As a result, the two rate functions coincide up to scaling and are minimized by the Rademacher distribution. Therefore, we refer to the logarithmic integral in the rate function as Boolean entropy. Finally, we proved this logarithmic integral is maximized by the Rademacher distribution and monotone along the Boolean Central Limit Theorem."
2505.07878,The sufficient conditions for insolvability of some Diophantine equations of $n$-th degree,['math.NT'],['Eteri Samsonadze'],"The sufficient conditions for insolvability of the Diophantine equation $\sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i^{n}=bc^{n}$ ($n, m \geq 2$, $b, c\in \mathbb{N}$) in nonnegative integers are obtained for the case where the canonical decomposition of the number $c$ consists of powers of primes $p_i$ which satisfy the condition $\varphi(p_i^{k_i})\mid n$ ($p_i^{k_i }\geq 3)$ for some natural numbers $k_i$ $(i=1,2,\ldots ,l)$; $\varphi(x)$ is the Euler's totient function. Moreover, it is proved that if $b< m< p_i^{k_i}$ $(i=1,2,\ldots ,l)$, then this equation has no solution with natural components $x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_m$. Besides, applying only elementary methods, it is proved that the Diophantine equation $x_1^n+x_2^n=(p^{s} p_1^{s_1} p_2^{s_2}\ldots p_l^{s_l})^{n}$ (with nonnegative integers $s$, $s_i$ $(i=1,2,..,l)$) has no solution with natural components if $n\geq 3$, $p$ is a prime number, while $p_i$ is a prime such that there is a natural number $k_i$ with $\varphi(p_i^{k_i})\mid n$ $(p_i^{k_i}\geq 3)$."

This answers the question whether a quasiconvex subgroup of a CAT(0) group is a CAT(0) group in the affirmative for the groups F m x Zn.

In this paper we provide a complete classification of the purely contractive analytic functions such that the associated contraction is a c.n.u. power partial isometry. As an application of our findings, we determine a class of contractive polynomials such that the associated c.n.u. power partial isometry is of the explicit diagonal form $S \oplus N \oplus C$, where $S$ and $C^*$ are unilateral shifts and $N$ is nilpotent.

In 1972, Gosper provided an algorithm to solve this problem. In this paper, we extend this approach in order to develop an arithmetic for multidimensional continued fractions (MCFs). First, we define the Möbius transform of an MCF and we provide an algorithm to obtain its expansion. Similarly, we deal with the bilinear transformation of MCFs, which covers as a special case the problem of summing or multiplying two MCFs. Finally, some experiments are performed in order to study the behavior of the algorithms."
2505.07806,The Schützenberger involution and colored lattice models,"['math.CO', 'math.RT']","['Henrik P. A. Gustafsson', 'Carl Westerlund']","Colored lattice models can be used to describe many different types of special functions of interest in both algebraic combinatorics and representation theory, for example Schur polynomials, nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials, and characters and Whittaker functions for representations of p-adic groups. A notable example is the metaplectic ice model of which there are actually two different variants: a Gamma and a Delta variant. These variants differ in key aspects but surprisingly produce equal partition functions, which are weighted sums over admissible configurations, and this equality is called the Gamma-Delta duality. The duality was used to prove the analytic continuation of certain multiple Dirichlet series and is highly non-trivial, especially since the number of configurations on each side of the equality can differ.
  In this paper we construct a new family of solvable, colored lattice models and prove that they are dual to existing lattice models in the literature, including the above metaplectic case and the lattice model for (non-metaplectic) Iwahori Whittaker functions together with its crystal limit for Demazure atoms for Cartan type A. The equality of partition functions is shown using Yang-Baxter equations involving R-matrices mixing lattice model rows of types Gamma and Delta.
  For the crystal Demazure lattice model we show that the duality refines to a weight-respecting bijection of states given by the Schützenberger involution on the associated Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns or semistandard Young tableaux. We also show how the individual steps exchanging two rows in the proof of the duality for the partition functions refines to Berenstein-Kirillov, or Bender-Knuth involutions."
2505.07803,Log-free bounds on exponential sums over primes,['math.NT'],['Priyamvad Srivastav'],"We obtain log-free bounds for exponential sums over the primes and the Möbius function. Let $0<η\leq 1/10$, and $α= a/q + δ/x$, with $(a,q)=1$ and $|δ| \leq x^{1/5 + η}/q$, and set $δ_0 = \max(1, |δ|/4)$. If $x \geq x_0(η)$ is sufficiently large, we show that: $$\biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} Λ(n) e(nα) \biggr| \leq \frac{q}{\varphi(q)} \frac{\mathscr{F}_η\bigl( \frac{\log δ_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ δ_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \, x }{\sqrt{δ_0 q}} \quad \text{and} \quad \biggl| \sum_{n \leq x} μ(n) e(nα) \biggr| \leq \frac{\mathscr{G}_η\bigl( \frac{\log δ_0 q}{\log x}, \frac{\log^+ δ_0/q}{\log x} \bigr) \, x}{\sqrt{δ_0 \varphi(q)}}, $$ for all $1 \leq q \leq x^{2/5 - η}$, where $\log^+ z = \max(\log z, 0)$, and the functions $\mathscr{F}_η$ and $\mathscr{G}_η$ are explicitly determined, taking small to moderate values. These results substantially improve upon the existing bounds in the literature, specifically with respect to the range of $q$ and $δ$ (for which log-free bounds are known) and potentially with respect to the asymptotic functions $\mathscr{F}_η$ and $\mathscr{G}_η$ as well. The main new ingredient is a Vaughan's identity with sieve weights (Lemma 2.1), which effectively renders it log-free. We use several ideas and results from the pioneering work of Helfgott, and particularly, they play a central role in the ensuring the log-freeness of the type-I contribution. Also, like in his work, these bounds improve as $δ$ increases."

Ferreira', 'Miguel A. Bessa']","We introduce the first Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU) framework that finds any history-dependent material model from full-field displacement and global force data (global, indirect discovery) or from strain-stress data (local, direct discovery). We show that ADiMU can update conventional (physics-based), neural network (data-driven), and hybrid material models. Moreover, this framework requires no fine-tuning of hyperparameters or additional quantities beyond those inherent to the user-selected material model architecture and optimizer. The robustness and versatility of ADiMU is extensively exemplified by updating different models spanning tens to millions of parameters, in both local and global discovery settings. Relying on fully differentiable code, the algorithmic implementation leverages vectorizing maps that enable history-dependent automatic differentiation via efficient batched execution of shared computation graphs. This contribution also aims to facilitate the integration, evaluation and application of future material model architectures by openly supporting the research community. Therefore, ADiMU is released as an open-source computational tool, integrated into a carefully designed and documented software named HookeAI."
2505.07799,Isomorphisms of unit distance graphs of layers,"['math.CO', 'cs.DM']",['Arthur Igorevich Bikeev'],"For any $\varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, consider the metric spaces $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon]$ in the Euclidean plane named layers or strips. B. Baslaugh in 1998 found the minimal width $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ of a layer such that its unit distance graph contains a cycle of a given odd length $k$. The first of the main results of this paper is the fact that the unit distance graphs of two layers $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_1], \mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_2]$ are non-isomorphic for any different values $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2 \in (0,+\infty)$.
  We also get a multidimensional analogue of this theorem. For given $n,m \in \mathbb{N}, p \in (1,+\infty), \varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, we say that the metric space on $\mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]^m$ with the metric space distance generated by $l_p$-norm in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is a layer $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon)$. We show that the unit distance graphs of layers $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_1), L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_2)$ are non-isomorphic for $\varepsilon_1 \neq \varepsilon_2$.
  The third main result of this paper is the theorem that, for $n \geq 2, \varepsilon > 0$, any automorphism $φ$ of the unit distance graph of layer $L = L(n,1,2,\varepsilon) = \mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]$ is an isometry. This is related to the Beckman-Quarles theorem of 1953, which states that any unit-preserving mapping of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an isometry, and to the rational analogue of this theorem obtained by A. Sokolov in 2023."
2505.07788,A counterexample for local smoothing for averages over curves,['math.CA'],"['David Beltran', 'Jonathan Hickman']",We provide a new necessary condition for local smoothing estimates for the averaging operator defined by convolution with a measure supported on a smooth non-degenerate curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 3$. This demonstrates a limitation in the strength of local smoothing estimates towards establishing bounds for the corresponding maximal functions when $n \geq 5$.

(1978). The question of whether this variant provides an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph was explicitly stated by Bi and Tang (2019). This letter presents an explicit example of a Tanner graph on 32 vertices, which shows that, in contrast to the Lovász $\vartheta$ function, this variant does not necessarily upper bound the Shannon capacity of a graph. The example, previously outlined by the author in a recent paper (2024), is presented here in full detail, making it easy to follow and verify. By resolving this question, the note clarifies a subtle but significant distinction between these two closely related graph invariants."

On-demand services are flexible while reducing the need for private cars, thus mitigating congestion and parking issues in limited urban space. While the coordination of high-capacity ridepooling on-demand service requires effective control to ensure efficiency, the emergence of the paradigm of robo-taxi opens the opportunity for centralized fleet control for an improved service quality.

Sparsity-promoting regularization is employed to prevent over-parameterization and reduce redundant features. This work is motivated by longstanding challenges in traditional RBF collocation methods, along with the limitations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and Gaussian process (GP) approaches, aiming to blend their respective strengths in a unified framework. The theoretical foundation of our approach lies in the function space of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) induced by one-hidden-layer neural networks of possibly infinite width. We prove a representer theorem showing that the sparse optimization problem in the RKBS admits a finite solution and establishes error bounds that offer a foundation for generalizing classical numerical analysis. The algorithmic framework is based on a three-phase algorithm to maintain computational efficiency through adaptive feature selection, second-order optimization, and pruning of inactive neurons. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight cases where it offers notable advantages over GP approaches. This work opens new directions for adaptive PDE solvers grounded in rigorous analysis with efficient, learning-inspired implementation."
2505.07761,Singular Control in Inventory Management with Smooth Ambiguity,"['math.OC', 'math.PR', 'q-fin.RM']","['Arnon Archankul', 'Jacco J. J. Thijssen']","We consider singular control in inventory management under Knightian uncertainty, where decision makers have a smooth ambiguity preference over Gaussian-generated priors. We demonstrate that continuous-time smooth ambiguity is the infinitesimal limit of Kalman-Bucy filtering with recursive robust utility. Additionally, we prove that the cost function can be determined by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations with quadratic growth. With a sufficient condition and utilising variational inequalities in a viscosity sense, we derive the value function and optimal control policy. By the change-of-coordinate technique, we transform the problem into two-dimensional singular control, offering insights into model learning and aligning with classical singular control free boundary problems. We numerically implement our theory using a Markov chain approximation, where inventory is modeled as cash management following an arithmetic Brownian motion. Our numerical results indicate that the continuation region can be divided into three key areas: (i) the target region; (ii) the region where it is optimal to learn and do nothing; and (iii) the region where control becomes predominant and learning should inactive. We demonstrate that ambiguity drives the decision maker to act earlier, leading to a smaller continuation region. This effect becomes more pronounced at the target region as the decision maker gains confidence from a longer learning period. However, these dynamics do not extend to the third region, where learning is excluded."

This formulation provides a natural Robin boundary analogue of the classical $L_p$-Minkowski problem introduced by Lutwak [43].

Differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck acting between modules over a commutative ring can be interpreted as torsion elements in the bimodule of all operators with respect to the diagonal ideal in the tensor square of the ring. Various notions of torsion modules for an infinitely generated ideal in a commutative ring lead to various notions of differential operators. We discuss differential operators of transfinite orders and differential operators having no global order at all, but only local orders with respect to specific elements of the ring. Many examples are presented. In particular, we prove that every ordinal can be realized as the order of a differential operator acting on the algebra of polynomials in infinitely many variables over a field. We also discuss extension of differential operators to localizations of rings and modules, and to colocalizations of modules."

Generalizing results of Sarnak and Erlandsson-Souto for constant curvature oriented surfaces, and with very different techniques, we give an asymptotic counting result on the number of strongly reversible periodic orbits of the geodesic flow in $M$, and prove their equidistribution towards the Bowen-Margulis measure. The result is proved in the more general setting with weights coming from thermodynamic formalism, and also in the analogous setting of graphs of groups with $2$-torsion. We give new examples in real hyperbolic Coxeter groups, complex hyperbolic orbifolds and graphs of groups."
2505.07727,Odd clique minors in graphs with independence number two,['math.CO'],"['Yuqing Ji', 'Zi-Xia Song', 'Evan Weiss', 'Xia Zhang']","A $K_t$-expansion consists of $t$ vertex-disjoint trees, every two of which are joined by an edge. We call such an expansion odd if its vertices can be two-colored so that the edges of the trees are bichromatic but the edges between trees are monochromatic. A graph contains an odd $K_t$ minor or an odd clique minor of order $t$ if it contains an odd $K_t$-expansion. Gerards and Seymour from 1995 conjectured that every graph $G$ contains an odd $K_{χ(G)}$ minor, where $χ(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$. This conjecture is referred to as ``Odd Hadwiger's Conjecture"". Let $α(G)$ denote the independence number of a graph $G$. In this paper we investigate the Odd Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs $G$ with $α(G)\le2$. We first observe that a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $α(G)\le2$ contains an odd $K_{χ(G)}$ minor if and only if $G$ contains an odd clique minor of order $\lceil n/2\rceil$. We then prove that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $α(G)\le 2$ contains an odd clique minor of order $\lceil n/2\rceil$ if $G$ contains a clique of order $n/4$ when $n$ is even and $(n+3)/4$ when $n$ is odd, or $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph, where $α(H)\le 2$ and $H$ is an induced subgraph of $K_1 + P_4$, $K_2+(K_1\cup K_3)$, $K_1+(K_1\cup K_4)$, $K_7^-$, $K_7$, or the kite graph."

2505.07699,Image Restoration via Integration of Optimal Control Techniques and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation,['math.AP'],['Dragos-Patru Covei'],"In this paper, we propose a novel image restoration framework that integrates optimal control techniques with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Motivated by models from production planning, our method restores degraded images by balancing an intervention cost against a state-dependent penalty that quantifies the loss of critical image information. Under the assumption of radial symmetry, the HJB equation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation and solved via a shooting method, from which the optimal feedback control is derived. Numerical experiments, supported by extensive parameter tuning and quality metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvement in image quality. The results not only validate the theoretical model but also suggest promising directions for future research in adaptive and hybrid image restoration techniques."

We focus on discrete groups with balls defined by invariant metrics associated with a variety of length functions. Under natural assumptions on the rough radial structure of the group in question, we establish a weak-type $\mathcal{L}\left(\log \mathcal{L}\right)^{\bf c}$ maximal inequality for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. We give a variety of examples where the rough radial structure assumptions hold, based on considerations from geometric group theory, or on analytic considerations related to the regular representation of the group. We elucidate the connections of these assumptions to a spherical coarse median inequality, to almost exact polynomial-exponential growth of balls, and to the radial rapid decay property.
  In particular, the weak-type maximal inequality in $\mathcal{L}\left(\log \mathcal{L}\right)^{\bf c}$ is established for any lattice in a connected semisimple Lie group with finite center, with respect to the distance function restricted from the Riemannian distance on symmetric space to an orbit of the lattice. It is also established for right-angled Artin groups, Coxeter groups and braid groups, for a suitable choice of word metric.
  For non-elementary word-hyperbolic group we establish that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator with respect to balls defined by a word length satisfies the weak-type $(1,1)$ maximal inequality, which is the optimal result."

We know that $\mathcal{R}_{G}(h,k)\subseteq\left[hk-h+1,\binom{h+k-1}{h}\right]$, where the right side is an interval of integers that includes the endpoints. These endpoints are known to be attained. We will prove that the integers in $\left[hk-h+2,hk-1\right]$ are not possible sizes for the $h$-fold sumset of a set containing $k\geq 4$ elements of a torsion-free additive abelian group $G$. Furthermore, we will confirm that this interval can't be made larger by exhibiting a subset of $G$ whose $h$-fold sumset has size $hk$."

In an acylindrically hyperbolic context, the authors of [HMO] demonstrated strong mixing situations, namely topological mu-mixing, a strengthening of high topological transitivity. Regarding non-metabelian and non-unimodular BS(m,n), we exhibit here a radically different situation on each of the pieces except one of the partition introduced in [CGLMS22] (although it is highly topologically transitive on each piece). On the other hand, when BS(m,n) is unimodular, we demonstrate the topological mu-mixing character on each of the pieces."

We prove that the analog of Gromov's non-squeezing theorem does not hold for $p$-adic embeddings: for any $p$-adic absolute value $R$, the entire $p$-adic space $(\mathbb{Q}_p)^{2n}$ is symplectomorphic to the $p$-adic cylinder $\mathrm{Z}_p^{2n}(R)$ of radius $R$, showing a degree of flexibility which stands in contrast with the real case. However, some rigidity remains: we prove that the $p$-adic affine analog of Gromov's result still holds. We will also show that in the non-linear situation, if the $p$-adic embeddings are equivariant with respect to a torus action, then non-squeezing holds, which generalizes a recent result by Figalli, Palmer and the second author. This allows us to introduce equivariant $p$-adic analytic symplectic capacities, of which the $p$-adic equivariant Gromov width is an example."

Conditionally on GRH we improve the existing upper bounds in the Pólya-Vinogradov inequality for $χ$, showing that $$ M(χ) := \max_{t \geq 1} \left|\sum_{n \leq t} χ(n) \right| \ll \sqrt{q} \frac{(\log\log q)^{1-δ_g} (\log\log\log\log\log q)^{δ_g}}{(\log\log\log q)^{1/4}}, $$ where $δ_g := 1-\tfrac{g}π\sin(π/g)$. Furthermore, we show unconditionally that there is an infinite sequence of order $g$ primitive characters $χ_j$ modulo $q_j$ for which $$ M(χ_j) \gg \sqrt{q_j} \frac{(\log\log q_j)^{1-δ_g} (\log\log\log\log\log q_j)^{δ_g}}{(\log\log\log q_j)^{1/4}}, $$ so that our GRH bound is sharp up to the implicit constant. This improves on previous work of Granville and Soundararajan, of Goldmakher, and of Lamzouri and the author."
2505.07650,On the choice of optimization norm for Anderson acceleration of the Picard iteration for Navier-Stokes equations,['math.NA'],"['Elizabeth Hawkins', 'Leo Rebholz']","While the most recent Anderson acceleration (AA) convergence theory [Pollock et al, {\it IMA Num. An.}, 2021] requires that the AA optimization norm match the Hilbert space norm associated with the fixed point operator, in implementations the $\ell^2$ norm is perhaps the most common choice. Unfortunately, so far there is little research done regarding this discrepancy which might reveal when it is fine to use $\ell^2$. To address this issue, we consider AA applied to the Picard iteration for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with varying choices of the AA optimization norm. We first prove a sharpened and generalized convergence estimate for depth $m$ AA-Picard for the NSE with the $H^1_0$ AA optimization norm by using a problem-specific analysis, utilizing a sharper treatment of the nonlinear terms than previous AA-Picard convergence studies, removing a small data assumption, and developing new AA term identities in the NSE nonlinear term estimates. Next, we prove a convergence result for when $L^2$ is used as the AA optimization norm, and this estimate is found to be very similar to that of the $H^1_0$ case. While no analogous theory seems possible for the $\ell^2$ norm, several numerical tests were run to compare AA-Picard convergence with varying choices of AA optimization norm. These tests revealed that convergence behavior was always similar for $L^2$ and $H^1_0$ and {\it usually but not always} similar for $\ell^2$: on a test problem for channel flow past a cylinder with coarser meshes, convergence of AA-Picard using $\ell^2$ performs significantly worse than using $L^2$ and $H^1_0$."

These estimators have the advantageous property of being admissible, similar to Bayes procedures, while also providing the conservative risk guarantees typical of frequentist methods. This paper demonstrates that Bayes minimax estimators can be derived using integral transformation techniques, specifically through the \( I \)-transform and the Laplace transform, as long as appropriate spherical priors are selected. Several illustrative examples are included to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
2505.07648,Markov Modelling Approach for Queues with Correlated Service Times -- the $M/M_D/2$ Model,['math.PR'],"['Suman Thapa', 'Yiqiang Q.

In recent years, the importance of such studies has been significantly increased, supported by new applications of greater significance to much larger scaled industry, and the whole society. Such studies have been considered very challenging.
  In this paper, a new Markov modelling approach for queueing systems with servers providing correlated services is proposed. We apply this new proposed approach to a queueing system with arrivals according to a Poisson process and two positive correlated exponential servers, referred to as the $M/M_D/2$ queue. We first prove that the queueing process (the number of customers in the system) is a Markov chain, and then provide an analytic solution for the stationary distribution of the process, based on which it becomes much easier to see the impact of the dependence on system performance compared to the performance with independent services."
2505.07647,Langevin Diffusion Approximation to Same Marginal Schrödinger Bridge,"['math.PR', 'stat.ML']","['Medha Agarwal', 'Zaid Harchaoui', 'Garrett Mulcahy', 'Soumik Pal']","We introduce a novel approximation to the same marginal Schrödinger bridge using the Langevin diffusion. As $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$, it is known that the barycentric projection (also known as the entropic Brenier map) of the Schrödinger bridge converges to the Brenier map, which is the identity. Our diffusion approximation is leveraged to show that, under suitable assumptions, the difference between the two is $\varepsilon$ times the gradient of the marginal log density (i.e., the score function), in $\mathbf{L}^2$. More generally, we show that the family of Markov operators, indexed by $\varepsilon > 0$, derived from integrating test functions against the conditional density of the static Schrödinger bridge at temperature $\varepsilon$, admits a derivative at $\varepsilon=0$ given by the generator of the Langevin semigroup. Hence, these operators satisfy an approximate semigroup property at low temperatures."

Building on work of Beheshti, Lehmann, Riedl and Tanimoto~\cite{BeheshtiLehmannRiedlTanimoto.dP}, we apply our strategy to del Pezzo surfaces of degree at most 5. In addition, we also treat the case of smooth cubic hypersurfaces and smooth intersections of two quadrics of dimension at least 3 by showing that the moduli spaces of rational curves of fixed degree are of the expected dimension. For large but fixed $q$, the bounds obtained come arbitrarily close to the linear growth predicted by the Batyrev--Manin conjecture."

For a generic germ of corank $2$ wave front $f\colon (\mathbb{C}^3,S) \to (\mathbb{C}^4,0)$, the image of a stable deformation $f_t$ of $f$ exhibits $A_k$ singularities with $k \leq 4$, their transverse intersections and the aforementioned $D_4$ singularities for $0 < |t| \ll 1$. By interpreting the image of $f_t$ as the discriminant (the image of the critical point set) of a smooth map germ $H_t\colon (\mathbb{C}^5,0) \to (\mathbb{C}^4,0)$, we define an algebra whose dimension over $\mathbb{C}$ is equal to the number of $D_4$ points in the image of $f_t$."

In this paper we propose a mean-field gradient descent dynamics for finding the MNE of zero-sum games involving $K$ players with $K\geq 2$. The evolution of the players' strategy distributions follows coupled mean-field gradient descent flows with momentum, incorporating an exponentially discounted time-averaging of gradients. First, in the case of a fixed entropic regularization, we prove an exponential convergence rate for the mean-field dynamics to the mixed Nash equilibrium with respect to the total variation metric. This improves a previous polynomial convergence rate for a similar time-averaged dynamics with different averaging factors. Moreover, unlike previous two-scale approaches for finding the MNE, our approach treats all player types on the same time scale. We also show that with a suitable choice of decreasing temperature, a simulated annealing version of the mean-field dynamics converges to an MNE of the initial unregularized problem."

We investigate the diffusion approximation of reaction networks with mass-action kinetics, focusing on the identifiability of the generator of the associated stochastic differential equations. We derive conditions under which the law of the diffusion approximation is identifiable and provide theorems for verifying identifiability in practice. Notably, our results show that some reaction networks have non-identifiable reaction rates, even when the law of the corresponding stochastic process is completely known. Moreover, we show that reaction networks with distinct graphical structures can generate the same diffusion law under specific choices of reaction rates. Finally, we compare our framework with identifiability results in the deterministic ODE setting and the discrete continuous-time Markov chain models for reaction networks."
2505.07632,O-minimal geometry of higher Albanese manifolds,"['math.AG', 'math.CV']",['Vasily Rogov'],"Let X be a normal quasi-projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. We study its higher Albanese manifolds, introduced by Hain and Zucker, from the point of view of o-minimal geometry. We show that for each $s$ the higher Albanese manifold $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ can be functorially endowed with a structure of an $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{alg}}$-definable complex manifold in such a way that the natural projections $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X) \to \operatorname{Alb}^{s-1}(X)$ are $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{alg}}$-definable and the higher Albanese maps $\operatorname{alb}^s \colon X^{\operatorname{an}} \to \operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ are $\mathbb{R}_{\operatorname{an}, \operatorname{exp}}$-definable. Suppose that for some $s \ge 3$ the definable manifold $\operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ is definably biholomorphic to a quasi-projective variety. We show that in this case the higher Albanese tower stabilises at the second step, i.e. the maps $\operatorname{Alb}^r (X) \to \operatorname{Alb}^{r-1}(X)$ are isomorphisms for $r\ge 3$. It follows that if $\operatorname{alb}^s \colon X^{\operatorname{an}} \to \operatorname{Alb}^s(X)$ is dominant for some $s \ge 3$, then the higher Albanese tower stabilises at the second step and the pro-unipotent completion of $π_1(X)$ is at most 2-step nilpotent. This confirms a special case of a conjecture by Campana on nilpotent fundamental groups of algebraic varieties. As another application, we prove the existence and quasi-projectivity of unipotent Shafarevich reductions."

However, LDES technologies are still immature and their future technology costs remain highly uncertain. In this context, we perform in this paper an extensive study to estimate the maximum LDES technology costs (which we define as viability costs) under which LDES systems would be economically viable in each state of the contiguous U.S. according to their characteristics. Our results indicate that only 4 states (out of 48) would be able to remove firm conventional generation supported by LDES systems without increasing their total system costs under the current US-DOE cost target of 1,100 US$/kW for multi-day LDES. In addition, we find that states with the highest LDES viability costs have in general low participation of thermal generation, a high share of wind generation, and higher thermal-related fixed operation and maintenance (FO&M) costs."

Among other notable results, order polytopes of graded posets are known to be $γ$-nonnegative by work of Brändén, who introduced the concept of sign-graded poset in the process.
  In the present paper we are interested in proving an equivariant version of Brändén's result, using the tools of equivariant Ehrhart theory (introduced by Stapledon in 2011). Namely, we prove that order polytopes of graded posets are always $γ$-effective, i.e., that the $γ$-polynomial associated with the equivariant $h^*$-polynomial of the order polytope of any graded poset has coefficients consisting of actual characters. To reach this goal, we develop a theory of order polytopes of sign-graded posets, and find a formula to express the numerator of the equivariant Ehrhart series of such an object in terms of the saturations (à la Brändén) of the given sign-graded poset."

We propose a new and simple constitutive relation for the hyperpressure to ensure that the models are both physically meaningful and mathematically well-posed. The framework is further extended to incorporate pressure-dependent viscosities. We show that for the pressure-dependent viscosity model, the inclusion of second-gradient effects guarantees the ellipticity of the governing pressure equation, in contrast to previous models rooted in classical continuum mechanics. The constant viscosity model is applied to steady cylindrical flows, where explicit solutions are derived under both strong and weak adherence boundary conditions. In each case, we establish convergence of the velocity profiles to the classical Navier-Stokes solutions as the model's characteristic length scales tend to zero."

We analyze both when the cat is captured quickly, and when the cat evades capture forever, or for an arbitrarily long time. We develop a reduction construction that retains the cat number of the graph, and classify all (reduced) graphs that have cat number 3 or less as a finite set of graphs. We expand on a logical characterization of infinite Cat Herding on trees to describe all infinite graphs on which the cat can evade capture forever. We also provide a brief characterization of the graphs on which the cat can score arbitrarily high. We conclude by motivating a definition of cat herding ordinals for future research."

We can consider the ``dual functional"" Lagrangian product $K_Φ\times_LK_{Φ^*}$ and the usual polar dual Lagrangian product $K_Φ\times_L K_Φ^{\circ}$. We show that for the former, all normalized symplectic capacities agree, while for the latter, we give a lower bound depending on $Φ$. In particular, under certain conditions on the $n$-tuple $Φ$, we get that $c(K_Φ\times_L K_Φ^{\circ})=4$, for any normalized symplectic capacity, that is, the strong Viterbo conjecture holds."

We perform a detailed analysis of the point spread function of a medical ultrasound imaging system when there is a mismatch between the effective sound speed in the medium and the one used in the backpropagation imaging functional. Based on this analysis, an estimator for the speed of sound error is introduced. Using recent results on stochastic homogenization of the Helmholtz equation, we provide a representation formula for the field scattered by a random multi-scale medium (whose acoustic behavior is similar to a biological tissue) in the time-harmonic regime. We then prove that statistical moments of the imaging function can be accessed from data collected with only one realization of the medium. We show that it is possible to locally extract the point spread function from an image constituted only of speckle and build an estimator for the effective sound velocity in the micro-structured medium. Some numerical illustrations are presented at the end of the paper."

We systematically establish sharp $L^{p}$-bounds and decay-type $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ estimates for heat operators on $G$, accommodating both bounded and unbounded Laplacians. The analysis utilizes Li-Yau-type Harnack inequalities and geometric completeness arguments to handle degenerate cases. As a key application, we prove the existence of global solutions to a semilinear parabolic system on $G$ under critical exponents governed by volume growth dimension $m$."

2505.07545,Congestion-Sensitive Grid Aggregation for DC Optimal Power Flow,"['math.OC', 'eess.SY']","['Benjamin Stöckl', 'Yannick Werner', 'Sonja Wogrin']","The vast spatial dimension of modern interconnected electricity grids challenges the tractability of the DC optimal power flow problem. Grid aggregation methods try to overcome this challenge by reducing the number of network elements. Many existing methods use Locational Marginal Prices as a distance metric to cluster nodes. In this paper, we show that prevalent methods adopting this distance metric fail to adequately capture the impact of individual lines when there is more than one line congested. This leads to suboptimal outcomes for the optimization of the aggregated model. To overcome those issues, we propose two methods based on the novel Network Congestion Price metric, which preserves the impact of nodal power injections on individual line congestions. The proposed methods are compared to several existing aggregation methods based on Locational Marginal Prices. We demonstrate all methods on adapted versions of the IEEE RTS 24- and 300-Bus systems. We show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches both in terms of objective function value error and maximum line limit violation, while exhibiting faster node clustering. We conclude that aggregation methods based on the novel Network Congestion Price metric are better at preserving the essential physical characteristics of the network topology in the grid aggregation process than methods based on Locational Marginal Prices."

This structure naturally defines two subgroups of its automorphism group, which are called the inner automorphism group and the displacement group, and they act on the quandle from the right. For a quandle with such groups being finitely generated, we investigate the graph structures induced from the actions, and induced metric spaces. The graph structures are defined by the notion of the Schreier graph, which is a natural generalization of the Cayley graph for a group. In particular, the metric associated with the displacement group for an important class of quandles, namely, generalized Alexander quandles, is studied in detail. We show that such a metric space is quasi-isometric to the displacement group with a word metric. Finally, we provide some examples quasi-isometric to typical metric spaces."
2505.07529,On Greenberg's generalized conjecture for families of number fields,['math.NT'],['Thong Nguyen Quang Do'],"For a number field $k$ and an odd prime $p$, let $\tilde{k}$ be the compositum of all the ${\mathbb Z}_p$-extensions of $k$, $\tilde{Λ}$ the associated Iwasawa algebra, and $X(\tilde{k})$ the Galois group over $\tilde{k}$ of the maximal abelian unramified pro-$p$-extension of $\tilde{k}$. Greenberg's generalized conjecture (GGC for short) asserts that the $\tildeΛ$-module $X(\tilde{k})$ is pseudo-null. Very few theoritical results toward GGC are known. We show here that for an imaginary k, GGC is implied by certain pseudo-nullity conditions imposed on a special ${\mathbb Z}^2_p$-extension of $k$, and these conditions are partially or entirely fullfilled by certain families of number fields."
2505.07526,Saturation theorems for neural network operators by solving elliptic and hyperbolic PDEs with analytical and semi-analytical inverse problems,['math.FA'],['Danilo Costarelli'],"This paper addresses inverse problems (in a broad sense) for two classes of multivariate neural network (NN) operators, with particular emphasis on saturation results, and both analytical and semi-analytical inverse theorems. One of the key aspects in addressing these issues is solving of certain elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), as well as suitable asymptotic formulas for the NN operators based on sufficiently smooth functions; the connection between these two topics lies in the application of the so-called generalized parabola technique by Ditzian. From the saturation theorems characterizations of the saturation classes are derived; these are respectively related to harmonic functions and to the solution of a certain transport equation. Analytical inverse theorems, on the other hand, are related to sub-harmonic functions as well as to functions in the Sobolev space $W^2_\infty$. Finally, the problem of reconstructing data affected by noise is addressed, along with a semi-analytical inverse problem. The latter serves as the starting point for deriving a retrieval procedure that may be useful in real world applications."
2505.07521,Convex Trajectory Optimization via Monomial Coordinates Transcription for Cislunar Rendezvous,['math.OC'],"['Omar Regantini', 'Ethan R. Burnett', 'Antonio Rizza', 'Alessandro Morselli', 'Francesco Topputo']","This paper proposes a nonlinear guidance algorithm for fuel-optimal impulsive trajectories for rendezvous operations close to a reference orbit. The approach involves overparameterized monomial coordinates and a high-order approximation of the dynamic flow precomputed using Differential Algebra, which eliminates the need for real-time integration. To address non-convexity in the monomial coordinate formulation of the guidance problem, Sequential Convex Programming is applied. Using the methodology presented in this paper, repeatedly evaluating the nonlinear dynamics is not necessary, as in shooting or collocation methods. Instead, only the monomial equations require updating between iterations, drastically reducing computational burden. The proposed algorithm is tested in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem framework with the target spacecraft on a Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit. The results demonstrate stability, efficiency, and low computational demand while achieving minimal terminal guidance errors. Compared to linear methods, this nonlinear convex approach exhibits superior performance in open-loop propagation of impulsive maneuvers in cislunar space, particularly in terms of accuracy. These advantages make the algorithm an attractive candidate for autonomous onboard guidance for rendezvous operations in the cislunar domain."

Freeman', 'Joanna Slawinska', 'Dimitrios Giannakis']","We develop a framework for the dynamical closure of spatiotemporal dynamics governed by partial differential equations. Employing the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics to embed the original classical dynamics into an infinite dimensional quantum mechanical system, we use the space of quantum states to model the unresolved degrees of freedom of the original dynamics and the framework of quantum measurement to predict their contributions to the resolved dynamics. The embedded dynamics is projected to finite dimension by a positivity preserving discretization process. Based on methods from operator valued kernels and delay embedding, the compressed finite dimensional representation of the dynamics is invariant under the spatial symmetries of the original dynamics. We develop a data driven formulation of the scheme that can be realized numerically and apply it to a dynamical closure problem for the shallow water equations. The results demonstrate that our closure model can accurately predict the main features of the true dynamics, including for out of sample initial conditions."
2505.07518,On Lambda functions in henselian and separably tame valued fields,['math.LO'],['Sylvy Anscombe'],"Given a field extension $F/C$, the ``Lambda closure'' $Λ_{F}C$ of $C$ in $F$ is a subextension of $F/C$ that is minimal with respect to inclusion such that $F/Λ_{F}C$ is separable. The existence and uniqueness of $Λ_{F}C$ was proved by Deveney and Mordeson in 1977. We show that it admits a simple description in terms of given generators for $C$: we expand the language of rings by the parameterized Lambda functions, and then $Λ_{F}C$ is the subfield of $F$ generated over $C$ by additionally closing under these functions. We then show that, given particular generators of $C$, $Λ_{F}C$ is the subfield of $F$ generated iteratively by the images of the generators under Lambda functions taken with respect to $p$-independent tuples also drawn from those generators.
  We apply these results to given a ``local description'' of existentially definable sets in fields equipped with a henselian topology. Let $X(K)$ be an existentially definable set in the theory of a field $K$ equipped with a henselian topology $τ$. We show that there is a definable injection into $X(K)$ from a Zariski-open subset $U_{1}^{\circ}$ of a set with nonempty $τ$-interior, and that each element of $U_{1}^{\circ}$ is interalgebraic (over parameters) with its image in $X(K)$. This can be seen as a kind of {\em very weak local quantifier elimination}, and it shows that existentially definable sets are (at least generically and locally) definably pararameterized by ``big'' sets.
  In the final section we extend the theory of separably tame valued fields, developed by Kuhlmann and Pal, to include the case of infinite degree of imperfection, and to allow expansions of the residue field and value group structures. We prove an embedding theorem which allows us to deduce the usual kinds of resplendent Ax--Kochen/Ershov principles."

  Further analysis considers the computational operation of subspace-based methods and proposes new numerical practices.
  In particular, analytical guarantees on dimension detection of spectral subspaces in the presence of noise are introduced.
  The generality of the framework invites application to a broad class of numerical methods, and its utility is demonstrated through recent advances in signal processing."

The model features two coupled order parameters: a Landau-de Gennes~$\mathbf{Q}$-tensor for the liquid crystal component and a magnetisation vector field~$\mathbf{M}$, both of them governed by a Ginzburg-Landau-type energy. The energy includes a singular coupling term favouring alignment between~$\mathbf{Q}$ and~$\mathbf{M}$. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of (not necessarily minimizing) critical points as a small parameter~$\varepsilon$ tends to zero. Our main results show that the energy concentrates along distinct singular sets: the (rescaled) energy density for the~$\mathbf{Q}$-component concentrates, to leading order, on a finite number of singular points, while the energy density for the~$\mathbf{M}$-component concentrate along a one-dimensional rectifiable set. Moreover, we prove that the curvature of the singular set for the $\M$-component (technically, the first variation of the associated varifold) is concentrated on a finite number of points, i.e.~the singular set for the~$\Q$-component."

2505.07499,KAM theory at the Quantum resonance,['math.DS'],"['Huanhuan Yuana', 'Yong Li']","We consider the semiclassical operator $\hat{H}(ε,h):=H_{0}(hD_{x})+ε\tilde{P}_{0}$ on $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{l})$, where the symbol of $\hat{H}(ε,h)$ corresponds to a perturbed classical Hamiltonian of the form:
  \begin{align*}
  H(x,y,ε)=H_{0}(y)+εP_{0}(x,y).
  \end{align*}
  Here, $\tilde{P}_{0}=Op_{h}^{W}(P_{0})$ is a bounded pseudodifferential operator with a holomorphic symbol that decays to zero at infinity, and $ε\in \mathbb{R}$ is a small parameter. We establish that for small $|ε|<ε^{*}$, there exists a frequency $ω(ε)$ satisfying condition \eqref{b}, such that the spectrum of $\hat{H}(ε,h)$ is given by the quantization formula:
  \begin{align*}
  E(n_{y},E_{u},E_{v},ε,h)=\varepsilon(h,ε)+h\sum_{j=1}^{d}ω_{j}(n_{y}^{j}+\frac{\vartheta_{j}}{4})+\fracε{2}\bigg(\sum_{j=1}^{d_{0}}λ_{j}
  (n_{u}^{j}+\frac{1}{2})+\sum_{j=1}^{d_{0}}\tildeλ_{j}(n_{v}^{j}+\frac{1}{2})\bigg)+O(ε\exp(-ch^{\frac{1}{α-1}})),
  \end{align*}
  where $α>1$ is Gevrey index, $\vartheta$ represents the Maslov index of the torus.
  This spectral expression captures the detailed structure of the perturbed system, reflecting the influence of partial resonances in the classical dynamics. In particular, the resonance-induced quadratic terms give rise to clustering of eigenvalues, determined by the eigenvalues $λ_{j}$ and $\tildeλ_{j}$ of the associated quadratic form in the resonant variables. Moreover, the corresponding eigenfunctions exhibit semiclassical localization-quantum scarring-on lower-dimensional invariant tori formed via partial splitting under resonance."
2505.07497,Generalized upper and lower Legendre conjugates for weight functions,['math.CA'],['Gerhard Schindl'],"We introduce and study new transformations between two functions satisfying some basic growth properties and generalize the known lower and upper Legendre conjugate (or envelope). We also investigate how these transformations modify recently defined growth indices for weight functions. A special but important and useful situation, to which the knowledge is then applied, is when considering associated weight functions which are expressed in terms of an underlying weight sequence. In this case these transformations precisely correspond to the point-wise product resp. point-wise division of the given sequences. Therefore, the new approach studied in this work illustrates the genuineness and importance and suggests applications for weighted spaces in different directions."

We show that the space of those $W\in \mathbb{G}(V)$ for which $\mathrm{G}_W$ acts trivially on $W$ (or $V$) is open in the Zariski topology of the Weil restriction $\mathrm{Res}_{\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{G}(V)$. More generally, this holds for the space of $W$ for which (a) the $\mathrm{G}_W$-action factors through its abelianization, or (b) the summands of the $\mathrm{G}_W$-representation on $W$ (or $V$) are otherwise dimensionally constrained.
  The results generalize analogous classical generic rigidity statements useful in establishing the triviality of the classical automorphism groups of random quantum graphs in the matrix algebra $M_n$, and can be put to similar use in fully non-commutative versions of those results (quantum graphs, quantum groups)."

Recognizing that lower sensitivity leads to higher accuracy, we analyze the key factors influencing the sensitivity of differentially private distributed algorithms. Building on these insights, we propose a novel differentially private distributed algorithm that enhances optimization accuracy by reducing sensitivity. To ensure practical applicability, we derive a closed-form expression for the noise parameter as a function of the privacy budget. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the proposed algorithm can achieve arbitrarily rigorous $ε$-differential privacy, establish its convergence in the mean square sense, and provide an upper bound on its optimization accuracy. Finally, extensive comparisons with various privacy-preserving methods validate the effectiveness of our algorithm."
2505.07469,Global structure behind pointwise equivalences of noncommutative polynomials,"['math.RA', 'math.OA']","['Eli Shamovich', 'Jurij Volčič']","This paper investigates the interplay between local and global equivalences on noncommutative polynomials, the elements of the free algebra. When the latter are viewed as functions in several matrix variables, a local equivalence of noncommutative polynomials refers to their values sharing a common feature point-wise on matrix tuples of all dimensions, such as rank-equivalence (values have the same ranks), isospectrality (values have the same spectrum), and pointwise similarity (values are similar). On the other hand, a global equivalence refers to a ring-theoretic relation within the free algebra, such as stable association or (elementary) intertwinedness. This paper identifies the most ubiquitous pairs of local and global equivalences. Namely, rank-equivalence coincides with stable association, isospectrality coincides with both intertwinedness and transitive closure of elementary intertwinedness, and pointwise similarity coincides with equality. Using these characterizations, further results on spectral radii and norms of values of noncommutative polynomials are derived."

Recently a new effective leaf peeling method has been proposed by S. Avdonin and P. Kurasov \cite{AK} for solving inverse problems on trees (graphs without cycles). It allows recalculating efficiently the inverse data from the original tree to the smaller trees, `removing' leaves step by step up to the rooted edge. In this paper we describe the main step of the spectral and dynamical versions of the peeling algorithm -- recalculating the inverse data for the `peeled tree'."

  The question of the possible order of the core of the tensor product (also known as categorical, Heidetnemi or direct product) of two graphs captures some well known problems. For instance, the recent counterexample to the Hedetniemi conjecture for 5-chromatic graphs is equivalent to saying that there are cores of order at least 5 whose product has a core of order 4.
  In this work, motivated by a question from Leonid Libkin in the area of graph databases, we first present methods of building cores whose categorical product is also a core. Extending on this we present sufficient conditions for a set of cores to have a product which is also a core. Presenting an example of such a family of digraphs, we construct a family of $\binom{2n}{n}$ digraphs, where the number of vertices of each is between $n^2+5n+2$ and $3n^2+3n+2$ and the product is a core. We then present a method of transforming the example into a family of graphs."

To adapt this for optimization over a space of probability distributions requires a suitable noise. For this purpose, we introduce here a simple stochastic process where a number of moments of the distribution are following a chosen finite-dimensional diffusion process, generalizing some previous studies where the expectation of the measure is subject to a Brownian noise. The process may explode in finite time, for instance when trying to force the variance of a distribution to behave like a Brownian motion. We show, up to the possible explosion time, well-posedness and propagation of chaos for the system of mean-field interacting particles with common noise approximating the process."

  As a consequence, random $\ell$-gonal groups at densities $\frac{1}{\ell} < d< \frac{1}{2}$ have boundaries homeomorphic to the Menger sponge, and $\frac{1}{\ell}$ is also the threshold for finiteness of $\mathrm{Out}(G)$.

We prove that the common theory of the class $C$ resplendently eliminates quantifiers down to the residue field and the value group, in a three sorted language of valued fields with a symbol for an angular component map and symbols for the parameterized lambda-functions. As a consequence, we obtain that equi-characteristic NIP and NIP$_n$ henselian fields with an angular component map resplendently eliminate field quantifiers in this language. We also prove that this elimination reduces existential formulas to existential formulas without quantifiers from the home sort. Finally, we draw several conclusions following the AKE philosophy for elements of the class $C$, including the usual AKE principles for $\equiv,\equiv_{\exists},\preceq,\preceq_{\exists}$ and for relative decidability."

More recently, Nathanson posed the inverse problem for the restricted sumset $h^{\wedge} A$ when $|h^{\wedge} A|$ is small. For $h \in \{2, 3, 4\}$, this question has already been studied by Mohan and Pandey.

To a variety $ \mathcal V $ is associated a numerical sequence called the sequence of proper central $G$-codimensions, $c^{G,δ}_n(\mathcal V), \, n \ge 1.$ Here $c^{G,δ}_n(\mathcal V)$ is the dimension of the space of multilinear proper central $G$-polynomials in $n$ fixed variables of any algebra $A$ generating the variety $\mathcal V.$
  Such sequence gives information on the growth of the proper central $G$-polynomials of $A$ and in \cite{LMR} it was proved that $exp^{G,δ}(\mathcal V)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sqrt[n]{c_n^{G,δ}(\mathcal V)}$ exists and is an integer called the proper central $G$-exponent.
  The aim of this paper is to characterize the varieties of associative

  To this end we construct a finite list of $G$-graded algebras and we prove that $exp^{G,δ}(\mathcal V) >2$ if and only if at least one of the algebras belongs to $\mathcal V$.
  Matching this result with the characterization of the varieties of almost polynomial growth given in \cite{GLP}, we obtain a characterization of the varieties of proper central $G$-exponent equal to two."

In particular, it is important to study the case where the dissipative coefficient behave like $1/t$ as $t$ goes to infinity, which is called weak dissipation, because its order is close to the critical case of decay and non-decay. In this case, an oscillating perturbation of weak dissipation can give a crucial effect on the energy decay estimate, but the analysis is very difficult compared to the case without oscillations. In this paper, we develop a method recently introduce by Ghisi-Gobbino that has contributed to a precise analysis for dissipative wave equations with oscillating weak dissipation, and consider the effect of the oscillations, which is more general and close to the critical case. Furthermore, we study the effect of the smoothness of the initial data on the energy decay estimates."

The algorithm is developed through a structured synthesis procedure: first, a robust controller leveraging the IMP ensures asymptotic convergence in the unconstrained setting. Second, an anti-windup augmentation guarantees stability and performance in the presence of the projection operator needed to satisfy the constraints.

Adrover', 'Marcelo Ruiz']","The concept of statistical depth has received considerable attention as a way to extend the notions of the median and quantiles to other statistical models. These procedures aim to formalize the idea of identifying deeply embedded fits to a model that are less influenced by contamination. Since contamination introduces bias in estimators, it is well known in the location model that the median minimizes the worst-case performance, in terms of maximum bias, among all equivariant estimators. In the multivariate case, Tukey's median was a groundbreaking concept for location estimation, and its counterpart for scatter matrices has recently attracted considerable interest. The breakdown point and the maximum asymptotic bias are key concepts used to summarize an estimator's behavior under contamination. For the location and scale model, we consider two closely related depth formulations, whose deepest estimators display significantly different behavior in terms of breakdown point. In the multivariate setting, we analyze recently introduced concentration inequalities that provide a unified framework for studying both the statistical convergence rate and robustness of Tukey's median and depth-based scatter matrices. We observe that slight variations in these inequalities allow us to visualize the maximum bias behavior of the deepest estimators. Since the maximum bias for depth-based scatter matrices had not previously been derived, we explicitly calculate both the breakdown point and the maximum bias curve for the deepest scatter matrices."
2505.07378,Undecidability of Polynomial Inequalities in Subset Densities and Additive Energies,"['math.CO', 'cs.CC', 'math.LO']",['Yaqiao Li'],"Many results in extremal graph theory can be formulated as certain polynomial inequalities in graph homomorphism densities. Answering fundamental questions raised by Lov{á}sz, Szegedy and Razborov, Hatami and Norine proved that determining the validity of an arbitrary such polynomial inequality in graph homomorphism densities is undecidable. We observe that many results in additive combinatorics can also be formulated as polynomial inequalities in subset's density and its variants. Based on techniques introduced in Hatami and Norine, together with algebraic and graph construction and Fourier analysis, we prove similarly two theorems of undecidability, thus showing that establishing such polynomial inequalities in additive combinatorics are inherently difficult in their full generality."

Starting from the so-called principle of conditioning and using some arguments developed by Klartag-Sodin and Bobkov-Chistyakov-G{ö}tze, we give some upper bounds for the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of these weighted sums and a Normal distribution. Under some conditions on the conditional variances of the martingale differences, the obtained rates are always faster than those obtained in case of usual partial sums."

However, for the Euclidean ball, Rogers obtained the better upper bound $n(\log_{e}n)^{c}$, and this result was extended to certain symmetric convex bodies by Gritzmann. The constant $c$ above is independent on $n$. In this paper, we show that such a bound can be achieved for more general classes of convex bodies without symmetry, including anti-blocking bodies, locally anti-blocking bodies and $n$-dimensional polytopes with $n+2$ vertices."

We establish the global small-time approximate null controllability and the Lagrangian controllability of the system, in the class of smooth solutions, by following the approach initiated in \cite{CMS} to establish the global small-time null controllability of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the class of weak solutions and extended in \cite{LSZ1} to establish the global small-time null and Lagrangian controllability of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the class of strong solutions. This approach makes use of controls with an extra fast scale in time and some corresponding multi-scale asymptotic expansions of the controlled solution. This expansion is constructed by an iterative process which requires some regularity. The extra-difficulty here is that the MHD system at stake is mixed hyperbolic-parabolic, without any regularizing effect on the magnetic field. Despite our strategy makes use of a quite precise asymptotic expansion, we succeed to cover the case where the initial velocity belongs the Sobolev space $H^{24}$ and the initial magnetic field belongs to the Sobolev space $H^8$."
2505.07353,Neural Operators for Adaptive Control of Traffic Flow Models,['math.OC'],"['Kaijing Lyu', 'Junmin Wang', 'Yihuai Zhang', 'Huan Yu']","The uncertainty in human driving behaviors leads to stop-and-go instabilities in freeway traffic. The traffic dynamics are typically modeled by the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models, in which the relaxation time parameter is usually unknown or hard to calibrate. This paper proposes an adaptive boundary control design based on neural operators (NO) for the ARZ PDE systems. In adaptive control, solving the backstepping kernel PDEs online requires significant computational resources at each timestep to update estimates of the unknown system parameters. To address this, we employ DeepONet to efficiently map model parameters to kernel functions. Simulations show that DeepONet generates kernel solutions nearly two orders of magnitude faster than traditional solvers while maintaining a loss on the order of \(10^{-2}\). Lyapunov analysis further validates the stability of the system when using DeepONet-approximated kernels in the adaptive controller. This result suggests that neural operators can significantly accelerate the acquisition of adaptive controllers for traffic control."

2505.07343,Reflective centers as categories of modules,['math.CT'],['Peter Schauenburg'],"In [LWY23] the authors construct the reflective center of a module category M over a braided monoidal category B. The reflective center is by construction a braided module category over B. In the case where B is the category of modules over a finite dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebra H, acting on the category of modules over a comodule algebra, they construct a comodule algebra, the reflective algebra, whose modules are precisely the reflective center. In the construction, Majid's transmutation of H plays a crucial r{ô}le.  This note centers on the transmuted H, seeking to ''explain'' its appearance through a generalization in which the acting category is no longer a module category, but admits an internal reconstructed Hopf algebra; the transmutation is a special case of this notion. As a result, in certain cases, the reflective center is simply the category of modules in M over that Hopf algebra in B."
2505.07342,Rough Burger-like SPDEs,"['math.PR', 'math.AP']","['Nannan Li', 'Xing Gao']","By applying the theory of rough paths, Martin Hairer provided a notion of solution for a class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) of Burgers type, driven by additive space-time white noise in one spatial dimension. These equations exhibit spatial roughness that is too severe for classical analytical techniques to handle. Hairer developed a pathwise framework for solutions when the spatial regularity of the solution lies in the range $(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$. In this paper, we generalize Hairer's result by extending the spatial regularity to the range $(0, 1]$. More precisely, we establish the pathwise existence and uniqueness of mild (and, equivalently, weak) solutions to Burgers-type SPDEs under this spatial regularity regime."

II. (Local generic vanishing theorems for holonomic D-modules) We prove that the natural morphism from the proper pushforward to the total pushforward of an algebraic holonomic D-module by an open inclusion is an isomorphism if we first twist the D-module structure by suitable closed algebraic differential forms. III. (Laplace transform of a Stokes-filtered constructible sheaf of exponential type) Motivated by the construction in [YZ24], we~propose a slightly different construction of the Laplace transform of a Stokes-perverse sheaf on the projective line and show directly that it corresponds to the Laplace transform of the corresponding holonomic D-module via the Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff-Deligne-Malgrange correspondence. This completes the presentation given in [Sab13, Chap. 7]}, where only the other direction of the Laplace transformation is analyzed. We~also compare our approach with the construction made previously in [YZ24]."

It naturally extends well-known static problems such as lasso or total variation regularized problems to a (temporally) dynamic setting. Further, the decision variables, realized as BV curves, are allowed to exhibit discontinuities, in contrast to the design variables in classical optimal transport based regularization techniques. We prove the existence and a characterization of a sparse solution. Further, we use an adaption of the fully-corrective generalized conditional gradient method to experimentally justify that the determination of BV curves in the Wasserstein-$1$ space is numerically implementable."
2505.07311,Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Projected Gradient Descent for Physics-Informed Neural Networks,['math.OC'],"['Jonas Nießen', 'Johannes Müller']","In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of projected gradient descent for physics-informed neural networks for the Poisson equation. Under suitable assumptions, we show that the optimization error can be bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + 1/\sqrt{m} + ε_{\text{approx}})$, where $T$ is the number of algorithm time steps, $m$ is the width of the neural network and $ε_{\text{approx}}$ is an approximation error. The proof of our optimization result relies on bounding the linearization error and using this result together with a Lyapunov drift analysis. Additionally, we quantify the generalization error by bounding the Rademacher complexities of the neural network and its Laplacian. Combining both the optimization and generalization results, we obtain an overall error estimate based on an existing error estimate from regularity theory."
2505.07308,Revisiting Sparse Matrix Coloring and Bicoloring,"['math.NA', 'cs.DM', 'cs.MS', 'math.CO']","['Alexis Montoison', 'Guillaume Dalle', 'Assefaw Gebremedhin']","Sparse matrix coloring and bicoloring are fundamental building blocks of sparse automatic differentiation. Bicoloring is particularly advantageous for rectangular Jacobian matrices with at least one dense row and column. Indeed, in such cases, unidirectional row or column coloring demands a number of colors equal to the number of rows or columns. We introduce a new strategy for bicoloring that encompasses both direct and substitution-based decompression approaches. Our method reformulates the two variants of bicoloring as star and acyclic colorings of an augmented symmetric matrix. We extend the concept of neutral colors, previously exclusive to bicoloring, to symmetric colorings, and we propose a post-processing routine that neutralizes colors to further reduce the overall color count. We also present the Julia package SparseMatrixColorings, which includes these new bicoloring algorithms alongside all standard coloring methods for sparse derivative matrix computation. Compared to ColPack, the Julia package also offers enhanced implementations for star and acyclic coloring, vertex ordering, as well as decompression."

It is well known that $α(G) \le Θ(G) \le \vartheta(G)$ and $α(G) \le n_{\ge0}(G)$.
  Continuing a long line of work, we investigate the relationships between $ α(G) $, $ \vartheta(G) $, $Θ(G)$, and $ n_{\ge 0}(G) $. We prove a conjecture of Kwan and Wigderson, showing that for every integer $k$, there exists a graph $G$ with $α(G) \leq 2$ and $n_{\ge 0}(G) \ge k$. In addition, we prove that for every integer $k$, there exists a graph $G$ with $Θ(G) \leq 3$ and $n_{\ge 0}(G) \ge k$. Both results rely on a new observation: if the complement of $G$ contains a good spectral expander, then $n_{\geq 0}(G)$ must be large. We also show that $\vartheta(G)$ can be exponentially larger than $n_{\ge 0}(G)$, improving a recent result of Ihringer."

For the range of singularity under study, after having introduced a suitable self-adjoint extension that enables to transmit information from one side of the singularity to another, we prove null-controllability in arbitrary small time, firstly with an internal control supported in an arbitrary measurable set of positive measure, secondly with a boundary control acting on one side of the boundary. Our proof is mainly based on a precise spectral study of the singular operator together with some recent refinements of the moment method of Fattorini and Russell. This notably requires to use some fine (and sometimes new) properties for Bessel functions and their zeros."

We establish the non-asymptotic convergence rate analysis in terms of $(ν, δ)$-near stationarity in expectation under variable proximal parameters and batch sizes, which exhibits the superior convergence performance and enhanced stability in both theory and practice. We provide numerical results with both synthetic and real data which illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm in terms of algorithmic stability and efficiency."

In this article, we prove some results about the real Betti realizations of certain motivic $\mathcal{E}_1$- and $\mathcal{E}_\infty$-rings. We show that the motivic Thom spectrum functor and the topological one correspond to each other, as symmetric monoidal functors, under real realization. In particular, we obtain equivalences of $\mathcal{E}_\infty$-rings between the real realizations of the variants $\mathsf{MGL}$, $\mathsf{MSL}$, and $\mathsf{MSp}$ of algebraic cobordism, and the variants $\mathsf{MO}$, $\mathsf{MSO}$, and $\mathsf{MU}$ of topological cobordism, respectively. Using this, we identify the $\mathcal{E}_1$-ring structure on the real realization of $\mathsf{ko}$, the very effective cover of Hermitian K-theory, by an explicit 2-local fracture square, as being equivalent to $\mathsf{L}(\mathbb{R})_{\geq 0}$, the connective L-theory spectrum of $\mathbb{R}$."

Under weak identification, standard estimation methods, such as the generalized method of moments (GMM), can have sizeable bias in finite samples or even asymptotically. In addition, many practical settings involve a growing number of nuisance parameters, adding further complexity to the problem. In this paper, we study estimation and inference under a general nonlinear moment model with many weak moment conditions and many nuisance parameters. To obtain debiased inference for finite-dimensional target parameters, we demonstrate that Neyman orthogonality plays a stronger role than in conventional settings with strong identification. We study a general two-step debiasing estimator that allows for possibly nonparametric first-step estimation of nuisance parameters, and we establish its consistency and asymptotic normality under a many weak moment asymptotic regime. Our theory accommodates both high-dimensional moment conditions and function-valued nuisance parameters. We provide high-level assumptions for a general setting and discuss specific applications to the problems of estimation and inference with weak instruments and weak proxies."

Accurate upper and lower bounds on the number of such singular values are established with the help of auxiliary notions of upper and lower bound weights. Assuming that the Laplacian of the exponential weight changes sign along a curve, we construct optimal such weights by solving a free boundary problem, which yields a Weyl asymptotics for the counting function of the singular values in an interval of the form $[0,\mathrm{e}^{-τ/h}]$, for $τ>0$ smaller than the oscillation of the weight. We also provide a precise description of the leading term in the Weyl asymptotics, in the regime of small $τ> 0$."

It builds upon the concurrent synthesis framework presented in [1], in which the requirement of existence of an RCI set is modeled as a control-oriented regularization. Here, we reduce the conservativeness of the approach by bounding the qLPV system with an uncertain LTI system, which we derive using bound propagation approaches. The resulting regularization function is the optimal value of a nonlinear robust optimization problem that we solve via a differentiable algorithm. We numerically demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach over two benchmark approaches."

All such functions bounded by~1 are necessarily pretentious and they have exactly one Furstenberg system. Moreover, we characterize the class of pretentious functions that have precisely one Furstenberg system as those being Besicovitch (rationally) almost periodic.

The main result is a novel two-parameter Carleman estimate for the linear equation with internal observation, assuming a monotonicity condition on the main coefficient. As a primary application, we establish the local exact controllability to the trajectories by employing a duality argument for the linear case and a local inversion theorem for the nonlinear equation. Secondly, we establish the Lipschitz-stability of the inverse problem of retrieving an unknown potential using the Bukhge{\uı}m-Klibanov method, when some further assumptions on the interface are made.

A tantalizing open question due to Herzog and Iyengar asks whether a noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ is Koszul if its residue field $R/\mathfrak{m}$ has a finite linearity defect. We provide a positive answer to this question when $R$ is a Cohen-Macaulay local ring of almost minimal multiplicity with the residue field of characteristic zero. The proof depends on the study of noetherian local rings $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ such that $\mathfrak{m}^2$ is a principal ideal, which we call $g$-$stretched$ local rings. The class of $g$-stretched local rings subsumes stretched artinian local rings studied by Sally, and generic artinian reductions of Cohen-Macaulay local rings of almost minimal multiplicity. An essential part in the proof of our main result is a complete characterization of one-dimensional complete $g$-stretched local rings. Beside partial progress on Herzog-Iyengar's question, another consequence of our study is a numerical characterization of all $g$-stretched Koszul rings, strengthening previous work of Avramov, Iyengar, and Şega."
2505.07244,The Influence of the Memory Capacity of Neural DDEs on the Universal Approximation Property,"['math.DS', 'cs.LG', 'cs.NE']","['Christian Kuehn', 'Sara-Viola Kuntz']","Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying the memory capacity is the product $K τ$ of the Lipschitz constant and the delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation property. We show that if the memory capacity $Kτ$ is sufficiently small, the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE. Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity $Kτ$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by increasing the memory capacity $Kτ$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of DDEs with positive delay $τ>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory threshold, universal approximation holds."
2505.07228,Nakai-Moishezon criteria and the toric Thomas-Yau conjecture,"['math.DG', 'math.AG', 'math.SG']",['Jacopo Stoppa'],"We consider a class of Lagrangian sections $L$ contained in certain Calabi-Yau Lagrangian fibrations (mirrors of toric weak Fano manifolds). We prove that a form of the Thomas-Yau conjecture holds in this case: $L$ is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in this class if and only if a stability condition holds, in the sense of a slope inequality on objects in a set of exact triangles in the Fukaya-Seidel category. This agrees with general proposals by Li. We use the SYZ transform, the toric gamma theorem, and toric homological mirror symmetry in order to reduce the statement to one about supercritical deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections, known as the Nakai-Moishezon criterion. As an application, we prove that, on the mirror of a toric weak del Pezzo surface, if $L$ defines a Bridgeland stable object in the Fukaya-Seidel category in a natural sense, then it is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in the class. The converse also holds for the mirror of the projective plane blown-up at one or two points, and always holds assuming a conjecture of Arcara and Miles. When $L$ is Bridgeland unstable, we obtain a morphism from $L$ to a weak solution of the special Lagrangian equation with phase angle satisfying a minimality condition. These results are consistent with general conjectures due to Joyce. We discuss some generalisations, including a weaker analogue of our main result for general projective toric manifolds, and a similar obstruction, related to Lagrangian multi-sections, in a special case."

We do this by combining homological algebra and descriptive set theory, and hence study the Borel complexity of those functions inducing $H$, the abelian cocycles. We prove that, for every $N \geq 2$, there are no non-trivial Borel definable abelian cocycles coding group extensions of $(\mathbb{R}^N,+)$ by a countable abelian group $G$, and hence show that no non-trivial such group extensions exist.

A set of ${\rm U}_q$-invariants in ${\mathcal A}_m$ attached to certain acyclic trivalent graphs is obtained, which spans the subalgebra ${\mathcal A}_m^{{\rm U}_q}$ of invariants as vector space. A finite set of homogeneous elements is constructed explicitly, which generates ${\mathcal A}_m^{{\rm U}_q}$ as algebra. Commutation relations among the algebraic generators are determined. These results may be regarded as a non-commutative first fundamental theorem of invariant theory for ${\rm U}_q$. The algebra ${\mathcal A}_m$ is a non-flat quantisation of the coordinate ring of ${\mathbb C}^7\otimes{\mathbb C}^m$. As ${\rm U}_q$-module, ${\mathcal A}_m={\mathcal A}_1^{\otimes m}$ and we decompose ${\mathcal A}_1$ into simple submodules. The affine scheme associated to the classical limit of ${\mathcal A}_m$ is described. This is a rare case where the structure of a non-flat quantisation is understood."

2505.07192,Bifurcations of synchronized solutions in a continuum limit of the Kuramoto model with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs,['math.DS'],['Kazuyuki Yagasaki'],"We study bifurcations of the completely synchronized state in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators with two-mode interaction depending on two graphs. Here one of the graphs is uniform but may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse, and the other is a deterministic finite nearest neighbor. We use the center manifold reduction technique, which is a standard one in dynamical systems, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of completely synchronized state becomes unstable and a stable two-parameter family of $\ell$-humped sinusoidal shape stationary solutions ($\ell\ge 2$) appears. This contrasts the author's recent result on the classical KM for which bifurcation behavior in its CL is very different from ones in the KM and difficult to explain by standard techniques in dynamical systems such as the center manifold reduction. Moreover, similar bifurcation behavior is shown to occur in the KM, based on the previous fundamental results. The occurrence of such bifurcations were suggested by numerical simulations for the deterministic graphs in a previous study. We also demonstrate our theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM with the zero natural frequency."
2505.07190,Connectedness of the boundaries of the strata of differentials,"['math.AG', 'math.GT']",['Dawei Chen'],"Let $\mathcal{P}(μ)^{\circ}$ be a connected component of the projectivized stratum of differentials on smooth complex curves, where the zero and pole orders of the differentials are specified by $μ$. When the complex dimension of $\mathcal{P}(μ)^{\circ}$ is at least two, Dozier--Grushevsky--Lee, through explicit degeneration techniques, showed that the boundary of $\mathcal{P}(μ)^{\circ}$ is connected in the multi-scale compactification constructed by Bainbridge--Chen--Gendron--Grushevsky--Möller.
  A natural question is whether the connectedness of the boundary of $\mathcal{P}(μ)^{\circ}$ is determined by its intrinsic properties. In the case of meromorphic differentials, we provide a concise explanation that the boundary of $\mathcal{P}(μ)^{\circ}$ is always connected in any complete algebraic compactification, based on the fact that the strata of meromorphic differentials are affine varieties. We also observe that the same result holds for linear subvarieties of meromorphic differentials, as well as for the strata of $k$-differentials with a pole of order at least $k$.
  In the case of holomorphic differentials, using properties of Teichmüller curves, we provide an alternative argument showing that the horizontal boundary of $\mathcal{P}(μ)^{\circ}$ and every irreducible component of its vertical boundary intersect non-trivially in the multi-scale compactification."

TIBA leverages the analytic attractiveness of a trigonometric polynomial to reformulate the dynamics of $y, y',y''$ implied by ODE and boundary conditions. TIBA is particularly attractive for a linear ODE where the solution can be obtained directly by solving a linear system. The framework can be used to solve integro-differential equations. Numerical tests have been conducted to assess TIBA's performance regarding convergence, existence, and uniqueness of solution under various boundary conditions with expected results."

We rely on recent results of Crouzeix and Greenbaum [Spectral sets: numerical range and beyond. SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 40(3):1087-1001, 2019], showing that a convex region with a circular hole is a spectral set. Sufficient conditions are derived for convergence independent of the matrix dimensions. We apply our results to preconditioned nonsymmetric saddle-point systems, and show their applicability to families of block preconditioners that have not been previously covered by existing FOV analysis. A limitation of our theory is that the preconditioned matrix is required to have a small skew-symmetric part in norm. Consequently, our analysis may not be applicable, for example, to fluid flow problems characterized by a small viscosity coefficient. Some numerical results illustrate our findings."

We also discuss applications of these general formalisms to the theory of Harish-Chandra modules, specifically to classify irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over fields $F$ of characteristic zero and to identify smaller fields of definition of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over $\bar{F}$, particularly in the case of cohomological irreducible essentially unitarizable modules."

Poisson($λ$) copies of them at each vertex. If the expected volume of the animals w.r.t. $ν$ is infinite, then the whole $G$ is covered for any $λ>0$. If the second moment of the volume is finite, then it is easy to see that for small enough $λ$ the union of the animals has only finite clusters, while for $λ$ large enough there are also infinite clusters. Here we show that:
  1. If $G$ is a nonamenable free product, then for ANY $ν$ with infinite second but finite first moment and any $λ>0$, there will be infinite clusters, despite having arbitrarily low density.
  2. The same result holds for ANY nonamenable $G$, when the lattice animals are worms: random walk pieces of random finite length.
  It remains open if the result holds for ANY nonamenable Cayley graph with ANY lattice animal measure $ν$ with infinite second moment.

Our functor has remarkable properties. For example it is a tensor functor and sends every standard and costandard object in the principal block to a one-dimensional object. We connect our functor to recent work of Gruber and conjecture that our functor is equivalent to hypercohomology under the equivalence of the Finkelberg-Mirkovic conjecture.
2505.07143,Subgradient Regularization: A Descent-Oriented Subgradient Method for Nonsmooth Optimization,['math.OC'],"['Hanyang Li', 'Ying Cui']","In nonsmooth optimization, a negative subgradient is not necessarily a descent direction, making the design of convergent descent methods based on zeroth-order and first-order information a challenging task. The well-studied bundle methods and gradient sampling algorithms construct descent directions by aggregating subgradients at nearby points in seemingly different ways, and are often complicated or lack deterministic guarantees. In this work, we identify a unifying principle behind these approaches, and develop a general framework of descent methods under the abstract principle that provably converge to stationary points. Within this framework, we introduce a simple yet effective technique, called subgradient regularization, to generate stable descent directions for a broad class of nonsmooth marginal functions, including finite maxima or minima of smooth functions. When applied to the composition of a convex function with a smooth map, the method naturally recovers the prox-linear method and, as a byproduct, provides a new dual interpretation of this classical algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on several challenging classes of nonsmooth optimization problems, including the minimization of Nesterov's nonsmooth Chebyshev-Rosenbrock function."

This new proof also provided a conceptual understanding of the phenomenon. In this paper, we give, for the first time, a proof of the known phenomenon for the parameters $c=-3/4$ and $c=-5/4$, which is also conceptual, and we provide a generalization of the phenomenon and the proof for all bifurcation points of the Mandelbrot set."

We discuss a historical precedent which leads to the notion of {\em non-singular map} and we show that, for a topos ${\cal E}$ with a local state classifier, and each object $X$ therein, the domain of the full subcategory of ${{\cal E}/X}$ consisting of non-singular maps over $X$ is a topos, and that the inclusion is the inverse image functor of a hyperconnected geometric morphism. The prospective geometric applications direct our attention to local state classifiers in toposes `of spaces'. We show that, at least in the pre-cohesive topos of reflexive graphs, the local state classifier, which is a colimit by definition, may be characterized as a limit; more specifically, as a variant of a subobject classifier."

Second, we exhibit a whole-line operator whose spectral measure has Hausdorff dimension one, while every half-line restriction (under any boundary condition) has spectral measure of Hausdorff dimension zero. Finally, for the same whole-line operator, we prove the existence of a Borel set that carries positive spectral measure, yet has measure zero with respect to the spectral measure of the positive half-line restriction for every boundary condition."

These Lie groups preserve the direct sums of the subspaces determined by the grade involution and reversion under the adjoint and twisted adjoint representations in degenerate geometric algebras. We prove that the generalized degenerate Clifford and Lipschitz groups can be defined using centralizers and twisted centralizers of fixed grades subspaces and the norm functions that are widely used in the theory of spin groups. We study the relations between these groups and consider them in the particular cases of plane-based geometric algebras and Grassmann algebras. The corresponding Lie algebras are studied. The presented groups are interesting for the study of generalized degenerate spin groups and applications in computer science, physics, and engineering."
2505.07104,The Restricted Three-Body Problem as a Perturbed Duffing Equation,"['math.CA', 'math.AP', 'math.DS']","['Rongchang Liu', 'Qiudong Wang']","This paper investigates the restricted circular planar three-body problem. We prove that for every negative Jacobi constant of sufficiently large magnitude, the surface of unperturbed parabolic solutions breaks to induce homoclinic tangle for all but at most finitely many mass ratios of primaries. This result is not covered by \cite{G} as the required large magnitude of the Jacobi constant is uniform across the mass ratios.
  Our approach consists of three main ingredients. First, by introducing new coordinate transformations, we reformulate the restricted three-body problem as a perturbed Duffing equation. Second, we adopt the method recently introduced in \cite{CW} to derive integral equations for the primary stable and unstable solutions. This enables us to effectively capture the order of the singularities involved and to further establish the existence and analytic dependence of the invariant manifolds on the mass ratio of the primaries and the Jacobi constant. Third, in evaluating the Poincaré-Melnikov integral, we take advantage of the explicit homoclinic solution of the unperturbed Duffing equation.
  Compared to existing works, our proof is significantly simpler and more direct. Moreover, the paper is self-contained: we do not rely on McGehee's analysis in \cite{Mc} to justify the applicability of the Poincaré-Melnikov method."

We show how this ring $\tildeΛ$ is the natural place to define the stable versions of the higher Specht polynomials of Ariki, Terasoma, and Yamada and their generalized versions from the prequels to this paper, and investigate its various properties as a representation of the infinite symmetric groups. This requires defining infinite versions of Ferrers diagrams, standard Young tableau, semi-standard ones, and the appropriate representations inside $\tildeΛ$, which are irreducibe as limits of irreducible representations of finite symmetric groups. The homogeneous parts of $\tildeΛ$ and of its subring of polynomials in infinitely many variables are no longer completely reducible, and we determine the form of the maximal completely reducible sub-representations there (in several normalizations). After posing a conjecture about the decompositions of polynomials in $n$ variables using the representations of $S_{n+1}$, we obtain explicit filtrations on $\tildeΛ$ and its subring, whose graded pieces are the maximal completely reducible sub-representations at each step."

By allowing empty sets and working with multi-sets and weak partitions as indices, we obtain a decomposition of the action of $S_{n}$ on homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ into irreducible representations, in a way that lifts a formula of Stanley. By considering generalized higher Specht polynomials, we obtain yet another such decomposition, lifting another formula involving Kostka numbers. We also investigate several operations on both types of representations, which are based on normalizations of the generalized higher Specht polynomials that allow for defining their stable versions."

For a given $n$, the orbits of the action of $S_{n}$ are associated with subsets of the set of positive integers that are smaller than $n$, and we relate the representation associated with a set $I$ to the ones of $S_{n+1}$ associated with $I$ and with its union with $n$, the latter being a lifting of the Branching Rule."
2505.07095,Optimal control of convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations: Dynamic programming equation and Viscosity solutions,['math.OC'],"['Sagar Gautam', 'Manil T.

Anal.} {163}(4) (2002), 295--327] that the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to the first-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJBE) associated with the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) have not been resolved due to the lack of global solvability and continuous dependence results. However, by adding a damping term to NSE, the so-called \emph{damped Navier-Stokes equations} fulfills the requirement of existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions. In this work, we address this issue in the context of the following two- and three-dimensional convective Brinkman-Forchheimer (CBF) equations (damped NSE) in $\mathbb{T}^d,\ d\in\{2,3\}$:
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{u}}{\partial t}-μΔ\boldsymbol{u}+(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla)\boldsymbol{u}+α\boldsymbol{u}+β|\boldsymbol{u}|^{r-1}\boldsymbol{u}+\nabla p=\boldsymbol{f}, \ \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}=0,
  \end{align*}
  where $μ,α,β>0$, $r\in[1,\infty)$. We first prove the existence of a viscosity solution to the infinite-dimensional HJBE in the supercritical regime. For spatial dimension $d=2$, we consider the nonlinearity exponent $r\in(3,\infty)$, while for $d=3$, due to some technical difficulty, we focus on $r\in(3,5]$. In the case $r=3$, we require the condition $2βμ\geq 1$ for both $d=2$ and $d=3$. Next, we derive a comparison principle for the HJB equation covering the ranges $r\in(3,\infty)$ and $r=3$ with $2βμ\geq 1$ in $d\in\{2,3\}$. It ensures the uniqueness of the viscosity solution."

We study the secondary $Z_2$-valued index of elliptic boundary value problems for such operators. We prove a $Z_2$-valued analog of the splitting theorem: the $Z_2$-valued index of an operator on a closed manifold $M$ equals the $Z_2$-valued index of a boundary value problem on a manifold obtained by cutting $M$ along a hypersurface $N$. When $N$ divides $M$ into two disjoint submanifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$, the $Z_2$-valued index on $M$ is equal to the mod 2 reduction of the usual $Z$-valued index of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary value problem on $M_1$. This leads to a cohomological formula for the $Z_2$-valued index."

Borkar']","The behavior of slow-fast diffusions as the separation of scale diverges is a well-studied problem in the literature. In this short paper, we revisit this problem and obtain a new proof of existing strong quantitative convergence estimates (in particular, $L^2$ estimates) and weak convergence estimates in terms of $n$ (the parameter associated with the separation of scales). In particular, we obtain the rate of $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ in the strong convergence estimates and the rate of $n^{-1}$ for weak convergence estimate which are already known to be optimal in the literature. We achieve this using nonlinear filtering theory where we represent the evolution of fast diffusion in terms of its conditional distribution given the slow diffusion. We then use the well-known Kushner-Stratanovich equation which gives the evolution of the conditional distribution of the fast diffusion given the slow diffusion and establish that this conditional distribution approaches the invariant measure of the ``frozen"" diffusion (obtained by freezing the slow variable in the evolution equation of the fast diffusion). At the heart of the analysis lies a key estimate of a weighted Lipschitz distance like function between a generic one-parameter family of measures and the family of unique invariant measures (of the ``frozen"" diffusion parametrized by a path). This estimate is in terms of the operator norm of the dual of the infinitesimal generator of the ``frozen"" diffusion."

Given two resolutions connected by a flop, if the strict transform of a tilting bundle is again tilting, then the derived categories of the two resolutions are equivalent, thereby proving the Bondal-Orlov conjecture in this setup. Unfortunately, it is difficult to produce tilting bundles that are compatible with flops. In this article, we introduce the notion of CM-degree of locally-free sheaves on resolutions and use them to construct tilting generators. In particular, we show that if there exists a relative very ample line bundle on the resolution with CM degree equal to the dimension of the exceptional locus, then the generator bundles constructed by Van den Bergh and Toda-Uehara are also tilting bundles. The advantage of our approach is that the CM degree is preserved under strict transform. As a consequence we prove the Bondal-Orlov conjecture in certain cases of small resolutions."

If all elements of this cover are equal with respect to the given masses, we refer to them as equicoverings.
  To construct equicoverings, we study a natural generalization of $k$-fan partitions, which we call spiral equicoverings. Like $k$-fans, these consist of wedges centered at a common point, but arranged in a way that allows overlapping. Our main result nearly characterizes all reduced positive rational numbers $p/q$ for which there exists a covering by $q$ convex wedges such that every point is covered exactly $p$ times. The proofs use results about centerpoints and combine tools from classical mass partition results, and elementary number theory."

Considering the action of $S_n$ on $[n]=\{1,\dots,n\}$, let $κ(π_1,\dots,π_{\ell})$ be equal to the number of orbits of the action of the subgroup $\langle π_1,\dots,π_{\ell} \rangle \subset S_n$. There has been interest in the study of the combinatorial numbers $A(\ell,n,k)$ equal to the cardinalities $|\{(π_1,\dots,π_{\ell}) \in \mathcal{A}(\ell,n)\, :\, κ(π_1,\dotsπ_{\ell})=k\}|$. If one defines $B(\ell,n)=A(\ell,n,1)/(n-1)!$, then it is known that $B(\ell,n) = \sum_{(f_1,\dots,f_{\ell}) \in \mathbb{N}^{\ell}} \mathbf{1}_{\{n\}}(f_1\cdots f_{\ell}) \prod_{r=1}^{\ell-1} f_r^{\ell-r}$. A special case, $\ell=2$, is $B(2,n) = \sum_{d|n} d = σ_1(n)$ the sum-of-divisors function. Then $A(2,n,1)/n!=B(2,n)/n$ is called the abundancy index: $σ_1(n)/n$. We call $B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ the ``generalized abundancy index.'' Building on work of Abdesselam, using the probability model, we prove that $\lim_{N \to \infty} N^{-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N} B(\ell,n) n^{-\ell+1}$ equals $ζ(2)\cdots ζ(\ell)$. Motivated by this we state a more precise conjecture for the asymptotics of $-ζ(2) + N^{-1}\sum_{n=1}^{N} (B(2,n)/n)$."

2505.07047,The large-scale charging scheduling problem for fleet batteries: Lagrangian decomposition with time-block reformulations,['math.OC'],"['Sunney Fotedar', 'Jiaming Wu', 'Balazs Kulcsar', 'Rebecka Jornsten']","There is a rise in the need for efficient battery charging methods due to the high penetration of electromobility solutions. Battery swapping, a technique in which fully or partially depleted batteries are exchanged and then transported to a central facility for charging, introduces a unique scheduling problem. For scenarios involving a large number of batteries, commercial solvers and existing methods do not yield optimal or near-optimal solutions in a reasonable time due to high computational complexity. Our study presents a novel approach that combines variable layering with Lagrangian decomposition. We develop a new, tighter time-block reformulation for one of the Lagrangian sub-problems, enhancing convergence rates when used with our partial-variable fixing Lagrangian heuristic. We also propose an ergodic-iterate-based local search method to further improve the solution quality. Lower bounds are improved by learning the relation between Lagrangian multipliers and electricity cost. Our extensive benchmarks show superior computational performance against commercial solvers. We achieved, on average, a 43% lower objective value compared to state-of-the-art methods. In 71% of the instances, we obtained near-optimal solutions (optimality gap less than 6%), and 93% of the instances were below 10%. We obtained feasible solutions for all instances, compared to only 65% feasibility using incumbent methods. The developed exact method aims to support future research on charging scheduling, especially important for micromobility industry, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) applications, and second-life utilization of batteries. Furthermore, the developed polyhedral insights can be useful in other scheduling problems with a common underlying mathematical structure."
2505.07046,Streaming Krylov-Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent,"['math.NA', 'cs.LG']",['Stephen Thomas'],"We present SKA-SGD (Streaming Krylov-Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel optimization approach that accelerates convergence for ill-conditioned problems by projecting stochastic gradients onto a low-dimensional Krylov subspace. Directly inspired by recent advances in s-step Conjugate Gradient methods with streaming Gauss-Seidel Gram solvers \cite{dambra2025sstep}, our method extends these techniques to the stochastic optimization domain. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) projection coefficients computed via a single streaming Gauss-Seidel iteration, which is mathematically equivalent to Modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization; (2) a Chebyshev polynomial basis for constructing the Krylov subspace, providing superior numerical stability; and (3) efficient implementation for AMD GPUs using HIP. We prove that our streaming approach achieves a backward error near machine precision with $O(s^2)$ complexity rather than $O(s^3)$, where $s$ is the Krylov subspace dimension. Experimental results demonstrate that SKA-SGD significantly outperforms standard SGD and Adam in convergence rate and final error, particularly for problems with condition numbers exceeding $10^3$. GPU performance analysis reveals a crossover point where communication-avoiding benefits outweigh computational overhead, typically occurring at moderate scale ($p \approx 64$ processors) for problem sizes $n \geq 10^6$."

Then we show that $Γ$ densely and definably embeds in an $\mathcal{L}$-definable group $G$.
  Further, using a $C^1$-cell decomposition result, we show that $Γ$ densely and definably embeds in a definable $D$-group, generalizing the classical construction of Buium of algebraic $D$-groups and extending for that class of fields, results obtained in arXiv:2208.08293, arXiv:2305.16747."

One of the main difficulties is that the third eigenspace of the linearized operator may contain only spherical harmonics of degree $1$, and hence, an essential non-vanishing criterion fails [arXiv:2210.08482]. This non-vanishing criterion is indispensable for proving the best Bianchi-Egnell constant $C_{\tiny\mbox{BE}}(γ) < C_{\tiny\mbox{BE}}^{\tiny\mbox{loc}}(γ)$ that prevents a minimizing sequence converging to one of the optimizers. In addition, not being translation invariant, extracting a non-zero weak limit from a minimizing sequence presents difficulties. We found another hidden critical level $C_{\tiny\mbox{BE}}(γ) <1 - \frac{S_γ}{S},$ where $S$ is the best Sobolev constant that plays a significant role in proving the existence of an extremizer. In particular, we show that there exists a $γ_0>0$ such that for $γ\geq γ_0,\ C_{\tiny\mbox{BE}}(γ)$ is attained. Moreover, we remark that there is a region $γ_0 \leq γ< γ_c^{\star},$ where the third eigenspace of the linearized operator contains only spherical harmonics of degree $1.$ Our result improves some of the results in Wei-Wu [arXiv:2308.04667] corresponding to the HS inequality."

2505.07025,Local rainbow colorings of hypergraphs,['math.CO'],"['Zhenyu Li', 'Weichan Liu', 'Guowei Sun', 'Xia Wang', 'Shunan Wei']","In this paper, we generalize the concepts related to rainbow coloring to hypergraphs. Specifically, an $(n,r,H)$-local coloring is defined as a collection of $n$ edge-colorings, $f_v: E(K^{(r)}_n) \rightarrow [k]$ for each vertex $v$ in the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph $K^{(r)}_n$, with the property that for any copy $T$ of $H$ in $K^{(r)}_n$, there exists at least one vertex $u$ in $T$ such that $f_u$ provides a rainbow edge-coloring of $T$ (i.e., no two edges in $T$ share the same color under $f_u$). The minimum number of colors required for this coloring is denoted as the local rainbow coloring number $C_r(n, H)$.
  We first establish an upper bound of the local rainbow coloring number for $r$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ consisting of $h$ vertices, that is, $C_r(n, H)= O\left( n^{\frac{h-r}{h}} \cdot h^{2r + \frac{r}{h}} \right)$. Furthermore, we identify a set of $r$-uniform hypergraphs whose local rainbow coloring numbers are bounded by a constant. A notable special case indicates that $C_3(n,H) \leq C(H)$ for some constant $C(H)$ depending only on $H$ if and only if $H$ contains at most 3 edges and does not belong to a specific set of three well-structured hypergraphs, possibly augmented with isolated vertices. We further establish two 3-uniform hypergraphs $H$ of particular interest for which $C_3(n,H) = n^{o(1)}$.
  Regarding lower bounds, we demonstrate that for every $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with sufficiently many edges, there exists a constant $b = b(H) > 0$ such that $C_r(n,H) = Ω(n^b)$. Additionally, we obtain lower bounds for several hypergraphs of specific interest."

Moreover, we introduce a stretched variant of the Caputo fractional derivative and prove that its eigenfunction is, in fact, the Kilbas Saigo function. Furthermore, we solve fractional Cauchy problems involving the generator of the Pearson diffusion and the Fokker Planck operator, providing both analytic and stochastic solutions, which connect the newly defined process and fractional operator with the Kilbas Saigo function. We also prove that stretched non local Pearson diffusions share the same limiting distributions as their standard counterparts. Finally, we investigate fractional hyperbolic Cauchy problems for Pearson diffusions, which resemble time fractional telegraph equations, and provide both analytical and stochastic solutions. As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive a novel representation and an asymptotic formula for the Kilbas Saigo function with complex argument, which, to the best of our knowledge, are not currently available in the existing literature."

It is known that when the kernel concentrates around the origin, the nonlocal equation converges to the local one. In one spatial dimension, for a particular choice of the kernel, and under mere assumptions on the initial condition, we quantify the rate of convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance. Our proof is very simple, exploiting the so-called Evolutionary Variational Inequality for both the nonlocal and local equations as well as a priori estimates. We also present numerical simulations using the finite volume method, which suggests that the obtained rate can be improved - this will be addressed in a forthcoming work."
2505.07009,The $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for higher order Schrödinger operator with zero singularities in low odd dimensions,"['math.AP', 'math-ph', 'math.CA']","['Han Cheng', 'Avy Soffer', 'Zhao Wu', 'Xiaohua Yao']","This paper investigates the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators for higher-order Schrödinger operators $H = (-Δ)^m + V$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $m \ge 2$ and real-valued decaying potentials $V$. Our main objective is to establish the sharp $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-Δ)^m)$ in the presence of all types of zero-resonance singularities, for all odd dimensions $1 \le n \le 4m - 1$.
  Specifically, for odd $n$ with $1 \le n \le 4m - 1$, there exist $m_n$ types of zero resonances for $H$, along with a critical type $k_c$ (both depending on $n$ and $m$). If zero is a regular point of $H$ or a $\mathbf{k}$-th kind resonance with $1 \le \mathbf{k} \le k_c$, the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-Δ)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 < p < \infty$. If zero is a $\mathbf{k}$-th kind resonance with $k_c < \mathbf{k} \le m_n$, we show that the range of $p$-boundedness for $W_\pm(H; (-Δ)^m)$ narrows to $1 < p < p_{\mathbf{k}}$, where $$p_{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{n}{n - 2m + \mathbf{k} + k_c - 1}.$$ Additionally, if zero is an eigenvalue of $H$ (i.e., $\mathbf{k} = m_n + 1$), then $W_\pm(H; (-Δ)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 < p < \frac{2n}{n - 1}$.
  Furthermore, it is shown that the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-Δ)^m)$ are unbounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $p_{\mathbf{k}} < p \le \infty$ if $k_c < \mathbf{k} \le m_n$, and for all $\frac{2n}{n - 1} < p \le \infty$ if zero is an eigenvalue of $H$ with a non-zero solution $φ$ to $Hφ= 0$ in $\bigcap_{s < -\frac{1}{2}} L^{2}_{s}(\mathbb{R}^n) \setminus L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$(referred to as a $p$-wave resonance). The key idea of the proof is to reduce the $L^p$-unboundedness to establishing the optimality of time-decay estimates for $e^{itH}P_{ac}(H)$ in weighted $L^2$ spaces."

2505.07002,Three-edge-coloring (Tait coloring) cubic graphs on the torus: A proof of Grünbaum's conjecture,['math.CO'],"['Yuta Inoue', 'Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi', 'Atsuyuki Miyashita', 'Bojan Mohar', 'Tomohiro Sonobe']","We prove that every cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graph that can be embedded in the torus, with the exceptional graph class called ""Petersen-like"", is 3-edge-colorable. This means every (non-trivial) toroidal snark can be obtained from several copies of the Petersen graph using the dot product operation. The first two snarks in this family are the Petersen graph and one of Blanuša snarks; the rest are exposed by Vodopivec in 2008. This proves a strengthening of the well-known, long-standing conjecture of Grünbaum from 1968.
  This implies that a 2-connected cubic (multi)graph that can be embedded in the torus is not 3-edge-colorable if and only if it can be obtained from a dot product of copies of the Petersen graph by replacing its vertices with 2-edge-connected planar cubic (multi)graphs. Here, replacing a vertex $v$ in a cubic graph $G$ is the operation that takes a 2-connected planar cubic multigraph $H$ and one of its vertices $u$ of degree 3, unifying $G-v$ and $H-u$ and connecting the neighbors of $v$ in $G-v$ with the neighbors of $u$ in $H-u$ with a matching.
  This result is a highly nontrivial generalization of the Four Color Theorem, and its proof requires a combination of extensive computer verification and computer-free extension of existing proofs on colorability.
  An important consequence of this result is a very strong version of the Tutte 4-Flow Conjecture for toroidal graphs. We show that a 2-edge connected graph embedded in the torus admits a nowhere-zero 4-flow unless it is Petersen-like (in which case it does not admit nowhere-zero 4-flows). Observe that this is a vast strengthening over the Tutte 4-Flow Conjecture on the torus, which assumes that the graph does not contain the Petersen graph as a minor because almost all toroidal graphs contain the Petersen graph minor, but almost none are Petersen-like."

2505.06990,On some critical Riemannian metrics and Thorpe-type conditions,['math.DG'],['Mohammed Larbi Labbi'],"Let \((M, g)\) be a compact, closed Riemannian manifold of dimension \(n\), and let \(k\) be an integer such that \(2 \leq 2k \leq n\). Denote by \(R^k\) the \(k\)-th Thorpe tensor, defined as the \(k\)-fold exterior product of the Riemann curvature tensor \(R\). We consider the geometric functionals $ H_{2k}(g) := \int_M \operatorname{tr}(R^k) \, \mathrm{dvol}_g$ and $ G_{2k}(g) :=\int_M \|R^k\|^2 \, \mathrm{dvol}_g,$ where \(\operatorname{tr}(R^k)\) denotes the full contraction (trace) of \(R^k\). For \(k = 1\), \(H_2(g)\) coincides with the Hilbert--Einstein functional, while \(G_2(g)\) is the \(L^2\)-norm of the Riemann curvature tensor.
  We derive the first variation formulas for \(H_{2k}\) and \(G_{2k}\), and study some properties of their critical points. In particular, we prove that an Einstein metric is critical for \(G_2\) if and only if it is critical for \(H_4\). More generally, we show that a hyper-\((2k)\)-Einstein metric is critical for \(G_{2k}\) if and only if it is critical for \(H_{4k}\).
  We further introduce and study two new classes of Riemannian metrics: the \((2k)\)-Thorpe and \((2k)\)-anti-Thorpe metrics, defined via self-duality and anti-self-duality conditions on the Thorpe tensor \(R^k\), respectively. In dimension \(n = 4k\), we show that both types are critical for \(G_{2k}\). In higher dimensions (\(n > 4k\)), the same duality conditions imply that $R^k$ is harmonic. Under additional positivity assumptions on the Riemann tensor, we further deduce rigidity results for such metrics."

Using the d-bar steepest descent method, we derive long-time asymptotic expansions of the solutions, including both the electric field and the components of the Bloch vector, within any fixed cone. In particular, we formulate the inverse scattering transform as a properly posed Riemann-Hilbert problem, avoiding singularities in the scattering data by modifying the time evolution of the reflection coefficient. Under assumptions that allow only soliton generation, the leading-order asymptotics are determined by solitons inside the cone, while soliton-radiation interactions appear in lower-order terms. These results extend the applicability of the nonlinear steepest descent method to integrable systems with singularities in the associated Lax pair."

2505.06957,The basic component of the mean curvature of Riemannian foliations,['math.DG'],['Jesús A. Álvarez López'],"For a Riemannian foliation $F$ on a compact manifold $M$ with a bundle-like metric, the de Rham complex of $M$ is $C^{\infty}$-splitted as the direct sum of the basic complex and its orthogonal complement. Then the basic component $κ_{b}$ of the mean curvature form of $F$ is closed and defines a class $ξ(F)$ in the basic cohomology that is invariant under any change of the bundle-like metric. Moreover, any element in $ξ(F)$ can be realized as the basic component of the mean curvature of some bundle-like metric.
  It is also proved that $ξ(F)$ vanishes iff there exists some bundle-like metric on $M$ for which the leaves are minimal submanifolds. As a consequence, this tautness property is verified in any of the following cases: (a) when the Ricci curvature of the transverse Riemannian structure is positive, or (b) when $F$ is of codimension one. In particular, a compact manifold with a Riemannian foliation of codimension one has infinite fundamental group.

Note that we do not assume any hyperbolicity for $μ$.
  We also establish an analogous conclusion for compact invariant sets $Λ$ with a singular dominated splitting, assuming some mild contraction property (any regular ergodic measure properly supported in $Λ$ must have at least one negative Lyapunov exponent). This result will be used in our future work on the Palis density conjecture for three-dimensional vector fields."

We use finite elements of higher order for the approximation in space and a Galerkin-Petrov method with first order polynomials for the approximation in time. We require global continuity of the discrete velocity trajectory in time, while allowing the discrete pressure trajectory to be discontinuous at the endpoints of the time intervals. We show existence and uniqueness of the discrete velocity solution, characterize the set of all discrete pressure solutions and prove an optimal second order estimate in time for the pressure error in the midpoints of the time intervals. The key result and innovation is the construction of approximations to the pressure trajectory by means of post-processing together with the proof of optimal order error estimates. We propose two variants for a post-processed pressure within the set of pressure solutions based on collocation techniques or interpolation. Both variants guarantee that the pressure error measured in the L2-norm converges with optimal second order in time and optimal order in space. For the discrete velocity solution, we prove error estimates of optimal order in time and space. We present some numerical tests to support our theoretical results."

Train tracks with a single vertex suffice in this case. As an application, for each $p\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}$, we find an infinite sequence of Teichmüller polynomials $Θ_{g,p}$ associated to pseudo-Anosov maps on surfaces of genus $g\geq2$, such that the hyperbolic 3-manifold obtained as the mapping torus has first Betti number $g$.

2505.06927,Stability Regularized Cross-Validation,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG', 'stat.ML']","['Ryan Cory-Wright', 'Andrés Gómez']","We revisit the problem of ensuring strong test-set performance via cross-validation. Motivated by the generalization theory literature, we propose a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme that selects hyperparameters by minimizing a weighted sum of the usual cross-validation metric and an empirical model-stability measure. The weight on the stability term is itself chosen via a nested cross-validation procedure. This reduces the risk of strong validation set performance and poor test set performance due to instability. We benchmark our procedure on a suite of 13 real-world UCI datasets, and find that, compared to k-fold cross-validation over the same hyperparameters, it improves the out-of-sample MSE for sparse ridge regression and CART by 4% on average, but has no impact on XGBoost. This suggests that for interpretable and unstable models, such as sparse regression and CART, our approach is a viable and computationally affordable method for improving test-set performance."

2505.06921,Stochastic ADMM with batch size adaptation for nonconvex nonsmooth optimization,['math.OC'],"['Jiachen Jin', 'Kangkang Deng', 'Boyu Wang', 'Hongxia Wang']","Stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) is a popular method for solving nonconvex nonsmooth optimization in various applications. However, it typically requires an empirical selection of the static batch size for gradient estimation, resulting in a challenging trade-off between variance reduction and computational cost. This paper proposes adaptive batch size SADMM, a practical method that dynamically adjusts the batch size based on accumulated differences along the optimization path. We develop a simple convergence analysis to handle the dependence of batch size adaptation that matches the best-known complexity with flexible parameter choices. We further extend this adaptive scheme to reduce the overall complexity of the popular variance-reduced methods, SVRG-ADMM and SPIDER-ADMM. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods."

  \end{align*} First, for any $\vartheta<1/3$, we construct infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically strong and analytically weak solutions $u\in C([0,\infty),C^{\vartheta}(\mathbb{T}^3,\mathbb{R}^3))$. These solutions dissipate the energy pathwisely up to a stopping time $\mathfrak{t}$, which can be chosen arbitrarily large with high probability, i.e. it holds almost surely

For instance, torsion-free and nearly $G_2$-structures are saddle critical points of the volume-normalized $G_2$-Hilbert functional. This allows us to uniquely distinguish two new flows of $G_2$-structures, which can be considered as analogues of the Ricci flow in $G_2$-geometry."
2505.06866,Quantum preconditioning method for linear systems problems via Schrödingerization,['math.NA'],"['Shi Jin', 'Nana Liu', 'Chuwen Ma', 'Yue Yu']","We present a quantum computational framework that systematically converts classical linear iterative algorithms with fixed iteration operators into their quantum counterparts using the Schrödingerization technique [Shi Jin, Nana Liu and Yue Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 133 No. 230602,2024]. This is achieved by capturing the steady state of the associated differential equations. The Schrödingerization technique transforms linear partial and ordinary differential equations into Schrödinger-type systems, making them suitable for quantum computing. This is accomplished through the so-called warped phase transformation, which maps the equation into a higher-dimensional space. Building on this framework, we develop a quantum preconditioning algorithm that leverages the well-known BPX multilevel preconditioner for the finite element discretization of the Poisson equation. The algorithm achieves a near-optimal dependence on the number of queries to our established input models, with a complexity of $\mathscr{O}(\text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ for a target accuracy of $\varepsilon$ when the dimension $d\geq 2$. This improvement results from the Hamiltonian simulation strategy applied to the Schrödingerized preconditioning dynamics, coupled with the smoothing of initial data in the extended space."

This method is applied to solve a nonlinear system of $n\in \mathbb{N}$ differential equations of order $l\in \mathbb{N}$ with $n $ unknown functions $u_{i}\left( t \right)$, where $i=1,\, \mathellipsis ,\,n $.
  For a function $Q\in \mathcal{N}_κ(\mathcal{H}) ,\, κ\in \mathbb{N} \cup \lbrace 0 \rbrace$, posesing a pole at infinity of order $m \in \mathbb{N}$, the following factorization is establish \[ Q(z)=(z-β)^{m}\tilde{Q}(z), \, z\in \mathcal{D}(Q), \] where $β\in \mathbb{R}$ is a regular point of $Q$, and $\tilde{Q}\in \mathcal{N}_{κ'}(\mathcal{H})$ is holomotphic at $\infty$. Unlike the Krein-Langer representation of $Q$, which involves a linear relation $A$, this representation employs a bounded operator $\tilde{A}$ in the Krein-Langer representation of $\tilde{Q}$. The operator $\tilde{A}$ and the relation $A$ have identical spectra, except at $β$ and $\infty$. We demonstrate how to obtain this representation for a given meromorphic function $Q\in \mathcal{N}_κ^{n \times n}$ using the root functions developed in this work."

Arnold's second stability theorem states that the flow is Lyapunov stable if $0<\nablaω/\nablaψ<C_{ar}$ for some $C_{ar}>0$. In this paper, we show that, for a bounded domain, $C_{ar}$ can be taken as the first eigenvalue $\bmΛ_1$ of a certain Laplacian eigenvalue problem. When $\nablaω/\nablaψ$ reaches $\bmΛ_1$, instability may occur, as illustrated by a non-circular steady flow in a disk; however, a certain form of structural stability still holds. Based on these results, we establish a theorem on the rigidity and orbital stability of steady Euler flows in a disk."
2505.06806,Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition For Sparse Reconstruction of Closable Koopman Operators,"['math.DS', 'stat.ML']","['Nishant Panda', 'Himanshu Singh', 'J. Nathan Kutz']","Spatial temporal reconstruction of dynamical system is indeed a crucial problem with diverse applications ranging from climate modeling to numerous chaotic and physical processes. These reconstructions are based on the harmonious relationship between the Koopman operators and the choice of dictionary, determined implicitly by a kernel function. This leads to the approximation of the Koopman operators in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) associated with that kernel function. Data-driven analysis of Koopman operators demands that Koopman operators be closable over the underlying RKHS, which still remains an unsettled, unexplored, and critical operator-theoretic challenge. We aim to address this challenge by investigating the embedding of the Laplacian kernel in the measure-theoretic sense, giving rise to a rich enough RKHS to settle the closability of the Koopman operators. We leverage Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with the Laplacian kernel to reconstruct the dominant spatial temporal modes of various diverse dynamical systems. After empirical demonstration, we concrete such results by providing the theoretical justification leveraging the closability of the Koopman operators on the RKHS generated by the Laplacian kernel on the avenues of Koopman mode decomposition and the Koopman spectral measure. Such results were explored from both grounds of operator theory and data-driven science, thus making the Laplacian kernel a robust choice for spatial-temporal reconstruction."

In this work, we propose the first-ever stochastic gradient descent method for solving unconstrained trilevel optimization problems and provide a convergence theory that covers all forms of inexactness of the trilevel adjoint gradient, such as the inexact solutions of the middle-level and lower-level problems, inexact computation of the trilevel adjoint formula, and noisy estimates of the gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, and tensors of third-order derivatives involved. We also demonstrate the promise of our approach by providing numerical results on both synthetic trilevel problems and trilevel formulations for hyperparameter adversarial tuning."

We prove that the dominant part of solutions to the linearized equation around a $1$-line soliton is a time derivative of the $1$-line soliton multiplied by a function of time and transverse variables. The amplitude is described by a $1$-dimensional damped wave equation in the transverse variable, as is the case with the linearized KP-II equation."

A probabilistic cheater has a positive probability of declaring to have no money to give to other agents in the system, resulting in a potential financial benefits from being dishonest about his/her financial status. We provide a mean-field description of the agent-based model (in terms of a coupled infinite dimensional system of nonlinear ODEs), in the large population limit where the number of players is sent to infinity, and proves convergence of the coupled mean-field system to its stationary distribution (provided by a mixture of geometric distributions). In particular, the model gives rise to a novel formulation involving a mixture of probability distributions, thereby motivating the introduction of a unusual (generalized) entropy functional tailored to the associated mean-field system."
2505.06757,Some variants of the periodic tiling conjecture,"['math.CA', 'math.DS', 'math.LO']","['Rachel Greenfeld', 'Terence Tao']","The periodic tiling conjecture (PTC) asserts, for a finitely generated Abelian group $G$ and a finite subset $F$ of $G$, that if there is a set $A$ that solves the tiling equation $\mathbb{1}_F * \mathbb{1}_A = 1$, there is also a periodic solution $\mathbb{1}_{A_{\mathrm{p}}}$. This conjecture is known to hold for some groups $G$ and fail for others. In this paper we establish three variants of the PTC. The first (due to Tim Austin) replaces the constant function $1$ on the right-hand side of the tiling equation by $0$, and the indicator functions $\mathbb{1}_F$ and $\mathbb{1}_A$ by bounded integer-valued functions. The second, which applies in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$, replaces the right-hand side of the tiling equation by an integer-valued periodic function, and the functions $\mathbb{1}_F$ and $\mathbb{1}_A$ on the left-hand side by bounded integer-valued functions. The third (which is the most difficult to establish) is similar to the second, but retains the property of both $\mathbb{1}_A$ and $\mathbb{1}_{A_{\mathrm{p}}}$ being indicator functions; in particular, we establish the PTC for multi-tilings in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$. As a result, we obtain the decidability of constant-level integer tilings in any finitely generated Abelian group $G$ and multi-tilings in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$."

As a byproduct, we obtain bounds on the projective dimension of the second power of any monomial ideal. We also establish bounds on the Betti numbers of $ I^2 $, which are significantly tighter than those determined by the Taylor resolution of $ I^2 $. Moreover, we introduce the permutation ideal $\mathcal{T}_q$ which is generated by $q$ monomials. For any monomial ideal $I$ with $q$ generators, we establish that $β(I^2) \leq β({\mathcal{T}_q}^2)$.

Takens' embedding theorem shows that if $k > 2\dim M$, then $φ_{h,k}$ is an embedding for typical $h$. We consider the probabilistic case, where for a given probability measure $μ$ on $M$ one allows self-intersections in the time-delayed embedding to occur along a zero-measure set. We show that if $k \geq \dim M$ and $k > \dim_H(\text{supp} μ)$, then for a typical observable, $φ_{h,k}$ is injective on a full-measure set with a pointwise Lipschitz inverse. If moreover $k > \dim M$, then $φ_{h,k}$ is a local diffeomorphism at almost every point. As an application, we show that if $k > \dim M$, then the Lyapunov exponents of the original system can be approximated with arbitrary precision by almost every orbit in the time-delayed model of the system. We also give almost sure pointwise bounds on the prediction error and provide a non-dynamical analogue of the main result, which can be seen as a probabilistic version of Whitney's embedding theorem."

We present general upper bounds for the torsion index of half-spin groups, showing that, except for certain exceptional cases, it is at most twice that of the corresponding spin groups. For these exceptional cases, the torsion index is bounded above by at most $2^3$ times that of the spin groups. Our results also reveal that in many cases, the torsion index of half-spin groups coincides with that of the spin groups."

Traditional image quality evaluation often relies on expert judgment and full-reference metrics such as MSE and SSIM. However, these approaches are limited by their subjectivity or the need for a ground-truth image. In this paper, we investigate the usage of a no-reference image quality assessment method tailored for SPECT imaging, employing the Perception-based Image QUality Evaluator (PIQUE) score. Precisely, we propose a novel application of PIQUE in evaluating SPECT images reconstructed via filtered backprojection using a parameter-dependent Butterworth filter. For the optimization of filter's parameters, we adopt a kernel-based Bayesian optimization framework grounded in reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory, highlighting the connections to recent greedy approximation techniques. Experimental results in a concrete clinical setting for SPECT imaging show the potential of this optimization approach for an objective and quantitative assessment of image quality, without requiring a reference image."

The proposed approach employs sinusoidal perturbations to estimate the pseudo-gradients of unknown quadratic payoff functions. This is the first instance of noncooperative games being tackled in a model-free fashion with event-triggered extremum seeking. Each player evaluates independently the deviation between the corresponding current pseudo-gradient estimate and its last broadcasted value from the event-triggering mechanism to tune individually the player action, while they preserve collectively the closed-loop stability/convergence. We guarantee Zeno behavior avoidance by establishing a minimum dwell-time to avoid infinitely fast switching. In particular, the stability analysis is carried out using Lyapunov's method and averaging for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. We quantify the size of the ultimate small residual sets around the Nash equilibrium and illustrate the theoretical results numerically on an oligopoly setting."

Linearization via successive one-fold prolongations requires special properties of the linearizability distributions $\mathcal{D}^0 \subset \mathcal{D}^1 \subset\mathcal{D}^2 \subset \cdots$. Contrary to the case of static feedback linearizability, they need not be involutive but the first noninvolutive one has to contain an involutive subdistribution of corank one. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to replace, at each step, the first noninvolutive distribution by its involutive subdistribution of corank one, thus for the prolonged system we gain at least one new involutive distribution. Our algorithm is constructive, gives sufficient conditions for flatness, and can be seen as the dual of the dynamic feedback linearization algorithm of Battilotti and Califano [2003, 2005]."

Our first result generalizes the classical Ax-Grothendieck theorem: We show that if $ f_1, \ldots, f_m $ are elements of the free associative algebra $ D\langle X_1, \ldots, X_m \rangle $ generated by $ m \geq 1 $ variables over an algebraically closed division ring $ D $ of finite dimension over its center $ F $, and if the induced map $ f = (f_1, \ldots, f_m) \colon D^m \to D^m $ is injective, then $ f $ must be surjective. With no condition on the dimension over the center, our second result is that $ p(D) = D $ if $ p $ is either an element in $ F\langle X_1, \ldots, X_m \rangle $ with zero constant term such that $ p(F) \neq \{0\} $, or a nonconstant polynomial in $F[x]$. Furthermore, we also establish some Waring type results. For instance, for any integer $ n > 1 $, we prove that every matrix in $ \mathrm{M}_n(D) $ can be expressed as a difference of pairs of multiplicative commutators of elements from $ p(\mathrm{M}_n(D)) $, provided again that $ D $ is finite-dimensional over $ F $."

The proof uses a phase space barrier argument that yields a new obstruction to the existence of closed cohomogeneity one Einstein metrics, even when the principal orbits admit homogeneous Einstein metrics."
2505.06626,Positivity in the shadow of Hodge index theorem,"['math.AG', 'math.CO', 'math.CV']","['Jiajun Hu', 'Jian Xiao']","Taking a compact Kähler manifold as playground, we explore the powerfulness of Hodge index theorem. A main object is the Lorentzian classes on a compact Kähler manifold, behind which the characterization via Lorentzian polynomials over the Kähler cone and hence the validity of Hodge index theorem. Along the exploration, we discover several applications in complex geometry that may be unexpected before. (1) For a Lefschetz type operator given by the complete intersection of nef classes, we give a complete characterization of its kernel face against the pseudo-effective cone. (2) We provide a new approach to Teissier's proportionality problem from the validity of hard Lefschetz property. This perspective enables us to establish the extremals for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality on a strictly Lorentzian class, and thus also characterize the most extremal case for a log-concavity sequence given by the intersection numbers of two nef classes. These Lorentzian classes include the fundamental classes of smooth projective varieties or compact Kähler manifolds as typical examples, hence our result extends Boucksom-Favre-Jonsson's and Fu-Xiao's results in respective settings to broader contexts, e.g. certain algebraic cycle classes given by reducible subvarieties. (3) Furthermore, we also strengthen the proportionality characterization by comparing various quantitative deficits and establishing stability estimates. Two quantitative sharper stability estimates with close relation with complex Monge--Ampère equations and Newton-Okounkov bodies are also discussed."

The system is formulated in a weak sense and the analysis relies on a Faedo-Galerkin method tailored to handle the nonlinear coupling and heterogeneous domains. Under suitable assumptions on the initial data and source terms, enhanced regularity in both time and space is obtained. In contrast with classical scalar models, the study addresses a multi-component system with realistic boundary conditions and complex interfacial dynamics."
2505.06614,Shellability of Higher Independence Complexes of Graphs,"['math.CO', 'math.AC']","['Arka Ghosh', 'S Selvaraja']","This paper investigates the shellability of $r$-independence complexes $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$, a generalization of classical independence complexes introduced by Paolini and Salvetti. For a graph $G$, a subset $A \subseteq V(G)$ is $r$-independent if every connected component of the induced subgraph $G[A]$ has at most $r$ vertices. The associated simplicial complex $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ has been the subject of significant interest due to its connections to combinatorial topology and commutative algebra. We address the classification problem for shellable $r$-independence complexes, focusing on block graphs, trees, and related families. Our main results establish sufficient conditions for shellability based on structural graph parameters such as diameter and forbidden subgraphs. Furthermore, we develop constructive techniques for generating shellable complexes through graph operations, including star-clique attachments, clique whiskering, and clique cycle constructions. These results extend and refine earlier work on classical independence complexes and provide a framework for understanding the topological and algebraic properties of higher independence complexes in structured graph families."
2505.06608,RideAgent: An LLM-Enhanced Optimization Framework for Automated Taxi Fleet Operations,['math.OC'],"['Xinyu Jiang', 'Haoyu Zhang', 'Mengyi Sha', 'Zihao Jiao', 'Long He', 'Junbo Zhang', 'Wei Qi']","Efficient management of electric ride-hailing fleets, particularly pre-allocation and pricing during peak periods to balance spatio-temporal supply and demand, is crucial for urban traffic efficiency. However, practical challenges include unpredictable demand and translating diverse, qualitative managerial objectives from non-expert operators into tractable optimization models. This paper introduces RideAgent, an LLM-powered agent framework that automates and enhances electric ride-hailing fleet management. First, an LLM interprets natural language queries from fleet managers to formulate corresponding mathematical objective functions. These user-defined objectives are then optimized within a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) framework, subject to the constraint of maintaining high operational profit. The profit itself is a primary objective, estimated by an embedded Random Forest (RF) model leveraging exogenous features. To accelerate the solution of this MIP, a prompt-guided LLM analyzes a small sample of historical optimal decision data to guide a variable fixing strategy. Experiments on real-world data show that the LLM-generated objectives achieve an 86% text similarity to standard formulations in a zero-shot setting. Following this, the LLM-guided variable fixing strategy reduces computation time by 53.15% compared to solving the full MIP with only a 2.42% average optimality gap. Moreover, this variable fixing strategy outperforms five cutting plane methods by 42.3% time reduction with minimal compromise to solution quality. RideAgent offers a robust and adaptive automated framework for objective modeling and accelerated optimization. This framework empowers non-expert fleet managers to personalize operations and improve urban transportation system performance."
2505.06590,Generalised Erdős distance theory on graphs,"['math.CO', 'math.MG']","['Sean Dewar', 'Nora Frankl', 'Samuel Mansfield', 'Anthony Nixon', 'Jonathan Passant', 'Audie Warren']","The famous Erdős distinct distances problem asks the following: how many distinct distances must exist between a set of $n$ points in the plane? There are many generalisations of this question that ask one to consider different spaces and metrics, or larger structures of points. We bring these problems into a common framework using the concept of $g$-rigidity. Specifically, if $G=(V,E)$ is a (hyper)graph, $g$ is a map assigning polynomial measurements to the edges of $G$ and $f_{g,G}(P^V)$ gives the set of $g$-distinct realisations of the $g$-rigid graph $G$, where vertices must lie in a point set $P$, our main results describe sharp lower bounds for the size of $\big|f_{g,G}(P^V)\big|$. This allows us to obtain results for pseudo-Euclidean metrics, $\ell_p$ metrics, dot-product problems, matrix completion problems, and symmetric tensor completion problems.
  In addition, we use the recent work of Alon, Bucić and Sauermann along with a simple colouring argument to prove that the number of $\| \cdot\|$-distinct realisations of a graph $G=(V,E)$ within a $d$-dimensional point set $P$ is at least $Ω\left(\frac{|P|^{|V|-1}}{(\log |P|)^2} \right)$ for almost all $d$-norms. Our methods here also provide a short proof that the unit distance conjecture implies the pinned distance conjecture."
2505.06586,To what extent does the consideration of positive total flux influence the dynamics of Keller-Segel-type models?,['math.AP'],"['Khadijeh Baghaei', 'Silvia Frassu', 'Yuya Tanaka', 'Giuseppe Viglialoro']","Since the introduction of the Keller-Segel model in 1970 to describe chemotaxis (the interactions between cell distributions u and chemical distributions v), there has been a significant proliferation of research articles exploring various extensions and modifications of this model within the scientific community. From a technical standpoint, the totality of results concerning these variants are characterized by the assumption that the total flux, involving both distributions, of the model under consideration is zero. This research aims to present a novel perspective by focusing on models with a positive total flux. Specifically, by employing Robin-type boundary conditions for u and v, we seek to gain insights into the interactions between cells and their environment, uncovering important dynamics such as how variations in boundary conditions influence chemotactic behavior. In particular, the choice of the boundary conditions is motivated by real-world phenomena and by the fact that the related analysis reveals some interesting properties of the system."

Originating within the broader framework of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), PH has found diverse applications ranging from protein structure and knot analysis to financial domains such as Bitcoin behaviour and stock market dynamics. Despite its growing relevance, there remains a lack of accessible resources that bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementation for beginners. This paper offers a clear and comprehensive introduction to persistent homology, guiding readers from core concepts to real-world applications. Specifically, we illustrate the methodology through the analysis of a 3-1 supercoiled DNA structure. The paper is tailored for readers without prior exposure to algebraic topology, aiming to demystify persistent homology and foster its broader adoption in data analysis tasks."

We prove that for Anosov flows on smooth compact manifolds, the strong unstable (respectively, stable) distribution is integrable to complex manifolds, on which the flow acts holomorphically. Furthermore, assuming its complex dimension to be one, it is uniquely integrable to complex affine one-dimensional manifolds, each moreover affinely diffeomorphic to $\mathbb C$, on which the flow acts affinely. In this case, the weak stable (respectively, unstable) foliation is transversely holomorphic, and even transversely projective if the flow is assumed to be topologically transitive. By combining these facts in low dimensions, our main result is as follows : if a transversely holomorphic Anosov flow on a smooth compact five-dimensional manifold is topologically transitive, then it is either $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the suspension of a hyperbolic automorphism of a complex torus, or, up to finite covers, $C^\infty$-orbit equivalent to the geodesic flow of a compact hyperbolic manifold."

We analyze the stability of the proposed method and give rigorous error estimates with order $O(Δt^{k} + M^{-m})$, where $Δt$ and $M$ are time step size and number of collocation nodes in extended direction, respectively. Also, we point out that the computational cost and the storage requirement is essentially the same as the integer problems, namely, the computational cost and the storage of the present algorithm are $O(N)$ and $O(1)$, respectively, where $N$ is the total number of time step. We present several numerical examples, including both linear and nonlinear problems, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and to validate the theoretical results"

In recent years, delving into the factorization of the second operator appearing in the Fueter-Sce mapping theorem has uncovered its potential to generate novel classes of functions and their respective functional calculi. The sets of functions obtained from this factorization and the associated functional calculi define the so-called {\em fine structures on the $S$-spectrum}. This paper aims to comprehensively investigate the function theories for the fine structures of Dirac type in the quaternionic framework, presenting new series expansions for axially harmonic, Fueter regular, and axially polyanalytic functions. These series expansions are highly nontrivial. In fact, when considering the hypercomplex realm, specifically the quaternionic or the Clifford setting, extending the concept of complex power series expansion is not immediate, and different Taylor and Laurent expansions appear with different sets of convergence. Additionally, our objectives include establishing the representation formulas for these function spaces; such formulas encode the fundamental properties of the functions and have numerous consequences. Finally, in the last section of this paper, we explain the applications of the fine structures in operator theory."

Motivated by recent progress on coarse treewidth, Abrishami, Czyżewska, Kluk, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rzążewski (2025) conjectured a coarse analogue to this result: every graph that has a balanced separator consisting of a bounded number of balls of bounded radius is quasi-isometric to a graph with bounded treewidth. In this paper, we confirm their conjecture for $K_{t,t}$-induced-subgraph-free graphs when the separator consists of a bounded number of balls of radius $1$. In doing so, we bridge two important conjectures concerning the structure of graphs that exclude a planar graph as an induced minor."

Using Colmez's theory of periods of CM abelian varieties, we propose a definition for the height of a partial CM-type and prove that the Colmez conjecture follows from an arithmetic period formula for surfaces. We give an explicit conjecture for the form of this period formula, which relates the height of special points on a Shimura surface with special values of $L$-functions. Further, we relate the heights of periods given by Colmez to arithmetic degree of Hermitian line bundles and thus give a formulation of Colmez's full conjecture in geometric terms."

2505.06510,Optimizing Railcar Movements to Create Outbound Trains in a Freight Railyard,['math.OC'],"['Ruonan Zhao', 'Joseph Geunes', 'Xiaofeng Nie']","A typical freight railyard at a manufacturing facility contains multiple tracks used for storage, classification, and outbound train assembly. Individual railcar storage locations on classification tracks are often determined before knowledge of their destination locations is known, giving rise to railcar shunting or switching problems, which require retrieving subsets of cars distributed throughout the yard to assemble outbound trains. To address this combinatorially challenging problem class, we propose a large-scale mixed-integer programming model that tracks railcar movements and corresponding costs over a finite planning horizon. The model permits simultaneous movement of multiple car groups via a locomotive and seeks to minimize repositioning costs. We also provide a dynamic programming formulation of the problem, demonstrate the NP-hardness of the corresponding optimization problem, and present an adaptive railcar grouping dynamic programming (ARG-DP) heuristic, which groups railcars with common destinations for efficient moves. Average results from a series of numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and quality of the ARG-DP algorithm in both simulated yards and a real yard. On average, across 60 test cases of simulated yards, the ARG-DP algorithm obtains solutions 355 times faster than solving the mixed-integer programming model using a commercial solver, while finding an optimal solution in 60% of the instances and maintaining an average optimality gap of 6.65%. In 10 cases based on the Gaia railyard in Portugal, the ARG-DP algorithm achieves solutions 229 times faster on average, finding an optimal solution in 50% of the instances with an average optimality gap of 6.90%."

In this paper, we investigate their utility in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function: high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine learning for dynamical environments."

However, the DNR problem is computationally challenging due to the mixed-integer non-convex nature. One feasible approach for addressing this challenge is to reformulate binary line on/off state variables as (continuous) non-convex constraints, leading to a nonconvex program. Unfortunately, it remains unclear whether this formulation satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions at locally optimal solutions. In this brief, we study the existence of Lagrange multipliers in DNR problems and prove that under mild assumptions, Lagrange multipliers exist for the DNR model at every locally optimal solution almost surely such that the KKT conditions hold."

While it is known that there can be non-isomorphic unicyclic graphs with the same CSF, we find experimentally that such examples are rare for graphs with up to 17 vertices. In fact, in many cases we can recover data such as the number of leaves, number of internal edges, cycle size, and number of attached non-trivial trees, by extending known results for trees to unicyclic graphs. These results are obtained by analyzing the CSF of a connected unicyclic graph in the $\textit{star-basis}$ using the deletion-near-contraction (DNC) relation developed by Aliste-Prieto, Orellana and Zamora, and computing the ""leading"" partition, its coefficient, as well as coefficients indexed by hook partitions.

Pachner's theorem \cite{P91} shows the flip graph is connected with 1--4 and 4--1 moves, but (\mathcal{F}(n)) loses connectivity: it is connected for (5 \leq n \leq 9) ((n=5) minimal for (S^3)) but splits into multiple components at (n=16), (n=20), (n=21), and likely beyond. The polytopal closure of (\mathcal{F}(n)) is the component with all boundary complexes of convex 4-polytopes. We prove (\mathcal{F}(10)) and (\mathcal{F}(11)) are connected by showing: every non-polytopal 10-vertex seed triangulation (no 3--2 flips) is one 2--3 flip from a convex-polytope boundary, and every 11-vertex seed triangulation arises from a 10-vertex convex polytope via a 1--4 flip and 2--3 or 3--2 flips, both in the polytopal closure. We address four unflippable (S^3) complexes ((U(16)), (U(20)), (U_1(21)), (U_2(21))), showing each connects to the polytopal closure of (\mathcal{F}(n+1)) after one 1--4 vertex insertion and an annealing process maximizing removable-vertex chains. We propose the Weeping Willow Conjecture: non-polytopal components of (\mathcal{F}(n)) stem from the polytopal closure of (\mathcal{F}(m)), (m > n), via 4--1 moves, with the polytopal closure as the trunk and other components as branches."

In particular, Kalinov classified the simple finite-length modules over $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_t)$.

Under low regularity assumptions, convergence is established by proving that, up to a subsequence, the discrete pressure, velocity and concentration converge to a weak solution as the mesh size and time step tend to zero. The analysis is based on several key features: an H(div) reconstruction of the velocity, the skew-symmetrization of the concentration equation, the introduction of an auxiliary variable and the definition of a new numerical flux. Numerical examples demonstrate optimal rates of convergence for smooth solutions, and convergence for problems of low regularity."

2505.06452,Semiparametric semi-supervised learning for general targets under distribution shift and decaying overlap,['math.ST'],"['Lorenzo Testa', 'Qi Xu', 'Jing Lei', 'Kathryn Roeder']","In modern scientific applications, large volumes of covariate data are readily available, while outcome labels are costly, sparse, and often subject to distribution shift. This asymmetry has spurred interest in semi-supervised (SS) learning, but most existing approaches rely on strong assumptions -- such as missing completely at random (MCAR) labeling or strict positivity -- that put substantial limitations on their practical usefulness. In this work, we introduce a general semiparametric framework for estimation and inference in SS settings where labels are missing at random (MAR) and the overlap may vanish as sample size increases. Our framework accommodates a wide range of smooth statistical targets -- including means, linear coefficients, quantiles, and causal effects -- and remains valid under high-dimensional nuisance estimation and distributional shift between labeled and unlabeled samples. We construct estimators that are doubly robust and asymptotically normal by deriving influence functions under this decaying MAR-SS regime. A key insight is that classical root-$n$ convergence fails under vanishing overlap; we instead provide corrected asymptotic rates that capture the impact of the decay in overlap. We validate our theory through simulations and demonstrate practical utility in real-world applications on the internet of things and breast cancer where labeled data are scarce."

Then we compute the conjugate of each resulting piece to obtain piecewise quadratic functions defined over a parabolic subdivision. Finally we compute the maximum of all those functions to obtain the conjugate as a piecewise quadratic function defined on a parabolic subdivision. The resulting algorithm runs in linear time if the initial subdivision is a triangulation (or has a uniform upper bound on the number of vertexes for each piece).
  Our open-source implementation in MATLAB uses symbolic computation and rational numbers to avoid floating-point errors, and merges pieces as soon as possible to minimize computation time."

We show that $R$ is a homogeneous reductive C$^\infty$ manifold of the unitary group $U_2(A)\subset M_2(A)$ and carries the differential geometry deduced from this structure (including an invariant Finsler metric). Special attention is paid to the properties of geodesics and the exponential map. If the algebra $A$ is represented in a Hilbert space $H$, in terms of local charts of $R$, elements of the Riemann sphere may be identified with (graphs of) closed operators on $H$ (bounded or unbounded). In the first part of the paper, we develop several geometric aspects of $R$ including a relation between the exponential map of the reductive connection and the cross-ratio of subspaces of $H\times H$. In the last section we show some applications of the geometry of $R$, to the geometry of operators on a Hilbert space. In particular, we define the notion of bounded deformation of an unbounded operator and give some relevant examples."

This model consists of a coupled system of Navier-Stokes and Mullins-Sekerka type parts, and can be obtained from the sharp interface limit of the diffuse interface model proposed by the first author, Garcke, and Grün (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 22, 2012). We introduce a new notion of weak solutions and prove its global in time existence, together with a consistency result of smooth weak solutions with the classical Navier-Stokes-Mullins-Sekerka system. Our new notion of solution allows to include the case of different densities of the two fluids, a sharp energy dissipation principle à la De Giorgi, together with a weak formulation of the constant contact angle condition at the boundary, which were left open in the previous notion of solution proposed by the first author and Röger (Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré Anal. Non Linéaire 26, 2009)."

We establish a stability estimate that bounds the norm of the traceless second fundamental form of the hypersurface in terms of the deficit in the Minkowski inequalities satisfied by the hypersurface. Additionally, we prove the stability of Minkowski inequalities in specific cases of the Reissner-Nordström Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) and Anti-de Sitter Schwarzschild (AdS-Schwarzschild) manifolds, which serve as examples of warped products. We also establish a new rigidity result for locally conformally flat manifolds to understand the stability of these inequalities."
2505.06419,Initialization and training of matrix product state probabilistic models,"['math.NA', 'quant-ph']","['Xun Tang', 'Yuehaw Khoo', 'Lexing Ying']","Modeling probability distributions via the wave function of a quantum state is central to quantum-inspired generative modeling and quantum state tomography (QST). We investigate a common failure mode in training randomly initialized matrix product states (MPS) using gradient descent. The results show that the trained MPS models do not accurately predict the strong interactions between boundary sites in periodic spin chain models. In the case of the Born machine algorithm, we further identify a causality trap, where the trained MPS models resemble causal models that ignore the non-local correlations in the true distribution. We propose two complementary strategies to overcome the training failure -- one through optimization and one through initialization. First, we develop a natural gradient descent (NGD) method, which approximately simulates the gradient flow on tensor manifolds and significantly enhances training efficiency. Numerical experiments show that NGD avoids local minima in both Born machines and in general MPS tomography. Remarkably, we show that NGD with line search can converge to the global minimum in only a few iterations. Second, for the BM algorithm, we introduce a warm-start initialization based on the TTNS-Sketch algorithm. We show that gradient descent under a warm initialization does not encounter the causality trap and admits rapid convergence to the ground truth."

Let $\mathcal{G} = \left(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}\right)$ be a directed graph with vertex set $\mathcal{V} =\{1,\dots, N\}$, and let $\mathcal{P} = \{p_{ij}\}$ be a collection of weights, where each $p_{ij}\in (0, 1]$ is associated with the edge $(i,j) \in \mathcal{E}$. We introduce the function $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}: \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X} \to [0,1]$ defined by \begin{align*} d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}(\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}) := \left(1 - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \prod_{i=1}^N \left[1- d_i(g_i,h_i)\right]^{\frac{1}{p_{ji}}} \right), \end{align*} for all $\mathbf{g},\mathbf{h} \in \mathcal{X}$. In this paper we show that $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ defines a metric space over $\mathcal{X}$. Then we determine how this distance behaves under various graph operations, including disjoint unions and Cartesian products. We investigate two limiting cases: (a) when $d_{\mathcal{X},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{P}}$ is defined over a finite field, leading to a broad generalization of graph-based distances commonly studied in error-correcting code theory; and (b) when the metric is extended to graphons, enabling the measurement of distances in a continuous graph limit setting."

While these specific metrics have been thoroughly investigated, the overarching theory of projective metrics has remained underdeveloped since their introduction. In this paper, we present and develop the foundational theory of projective metrics, establishing several elementary key results on their characterizing properties, equivalence classes, isometries, constructions, connections with the Hamming metric, associated matroids, sphere sizes and Singleton-like bounds. Furthermore, some general aspects of scale-translation-invariant metrics are examined, with particular focus on their embeddings into larger projective metric spaces."

It is shown that, given $δ\in(0,1)$ and $ε\in(0,1]$, the ADAGB2 algorithm needs at most $\calO(ε^{-2})$ iterations to ensure an $ε$-approximate first-order critical point of the bound-constrained problem with probability at least $1-δ$, provided the average root mean square error of the gradient oracle is sufficiently small. Should this condition fail, it is also shown that the optimality level of iterates is bounded above by this average. The relation between the approximate and true classical projected-gradient-based optimality measures for bound constrained problems is also investigated, and it is shown that merely assuming unbiased gradient oracles may be insufficient to ensure convergence in $\calO(ε^{-2})$ iterations."

We put this result into a much wider context of graded structures on supermanifolds and describe explicitly several canonical equivalences of the corresponding categories in a purely geometrical and constructive way; the desuperization equivalence functor is a composition of some of them. Our constructions are completely canonical, we use such tools of supergeometry as the iterated tangent functor, the parity reversion in vector superbundles, and the modern view of $n$-tuple vector bundles as a sequence of commuting Euler vector fields of the vector bundle structures in question. All this opens new horizons in the land of graded supergeometry."

We derive a formula for the second order time derivative of the square of the distance between close fluid particles and show that a curvature term appears. The elongation of a material line is accelerated by negative curvature. The use of this expression extends Haller's definition of hyperbolic domains to flows on curved surfaces. The need to consider curvature effects is illustrated by three examples. The example of a curved two-dimensional torus implies that the filamentation of vortices can be triggered by negative curvature."
2505.06242,Holder continuity of an alternating Erdos series on prime K-tuples,['math.GM'],['Nikos Mantzakouras'],"This open problem, first posed by Erdοs, was further explored by Terence Tao. Tao work shows that the series can converge conditionally, but only under a sufficiently strong form of the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture for k-primary pairs. Based on this, we offer a new method leading to a representation of the series as a Riemann-Stieltjes integral or a tightly coupled prime counting function. We rigorously analyze this integral by decomposing it into principal and error terms, applying integration by parts in the Stieltjes sense, and defining the error terms. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we investigate the Hοlder continuation of ψ(x) in the asymptotic form ψ(x) = x+O(x 1/2), and introduce a test function g(x) = e^( iπx) e^( -λx) , which is smooth and Lipschitz. Applying Young's criterion, we show that the integral converges. Moreover , we prove that the integral converges perfectly for λ > 3 2 , based on sharp bounds on the error terms. Our results are supported by fractional Sobolev integrations and justify the use of Young's inequality under generalized Holder conditions."

2505.06234,The Largest Circle Enclosing $n$ Lattice Points,['math.GM'],['Jianqiang Zhao'],"In this paper, we propose a class of elementary plane geometry problems closely related to the title of this paper. Here, a circle is the 1-dimensional curve bounding a disk. For any nonnegative integer, a circle is called $n$-enclosing if it contains exactly $n$ lattice points on the $xy$-plane in its interior. The main questions are when the largest $n$-enclosing circle exists and what the largest radius is. We study the small integer cases by hand and extend to all $n<1100$ with the aid of a computer. We find that frequently such a circle does not exist, e.g., when $n=5,6$. We then show a few general results on these circles including some regularities among their radii and an easy criterion to determine exactly when largest $n$-enclosing circles exist. Further, from numerical evidence, we conjecture that the set of integers whose largest enclosing circles exist is infinite, and so is its complementary in the set of nonnegative integers. Throughout this paper we present more mysteries/problems/conjectures than answers/solutions/theorems. In particular, we list many conjectures and some unsolved problems including possible higher dimensional generalizations at the end of the last two sections."

First, we establish finite difference characterizations and fractional Sobolev-type inequalities in settings where the underlying measure is non-doubling or only satisfies a weak doubling condition. Second, we incorporate variable exponent and Orlicz space frameworks to capture nonstandard growth phenomena. Third, we derive anisotropic and directional versions of these inequalities to better address non-isotropic structures, and we apply our results to study regularity properties of nonlocal operators. Finally, we investigate the stability and sharpness of the associated constants as well as interpolation and limiting behaviors that bridge classical and fractional settings. These developments not only generalize existing results but also open new avenues for applications in partial differential equations and numerical analysis."

Specifically, the $n$-trailer system is analysed, showing that its associated distribution is related to a Lie system if $n = 0$ or $n = 1$. These systems allow symmetry reductions and the reconstruction of solutions of the original system from those of the reduced one. The reconstruction procedure is discussed and indicates potential extensions for studying broader classes of differential equations through Lie systems and new types of superposition rules."

We show that the limit of the spectral constant as $r$ goes to infinity is $2.$ Via the correspondence between annuli and hyperbolae, our study degenerates the problem to one on the quantum cross, pairs of contractions with product zero, where the spectral constant is exactly $2.$
  The essential technique is to rationally dilate $Z$ to $\hat{Z}$ which has $U =(\hat{Z}+(\hat{Z}^{-1})^*)/(r+1/r)$ unitary and estimate $Uf(\hat{Z})U^*$ directly."

A cubic number field with discriminant $D$ determines a unique nontrivial $\mathbb{F}_3$-orbit in the first cohomology group of the elliptic curve $E^D: y^2 = 4x^3 + D$ with respect to a certain 3-isogeny $φ$. Orbits corresponding to monogenic fields must lie in the soluble part of the Selmer group $S^φ(E^D/\mathbb{Q})$, and this gives a criterion to discard monogenity. From this, we can derive bounds on the number of monogenic cubic fields in terms of the rank of the elliptic curve. We can also determine the monogenity of many concrete pure cubic fields assuming GRH."
2505.06211,Alternating Methods for Large-Scale AC Optimal Power Flow with Unit Commitment,['math.OC'],"['Matthew Brun', 'Thomas Lee', 'Dirk Lauinger', 'Xin Chen', 'Xu Andy Sun']","Security-constrained unit commitment with alternating current optimal power flow (SCUC-ACOPF) is a central problem in power grid operations that optimizes commitment and dispatch of generators under a physically accurate power transmission model while encouraging robustness against component failures. SCUC-ACOPF requires solving large-scale problems that involve multiple time periods and networks with thousands of buses within strict time limits. In this work, we study a detailed SCUC-ACOPF model with a rich set of features of modern power grids, including price-sensitive load, reserve products, transformer controls, and energy-limited devices. We propose a decomposition scheme and a penalty alternating direction method to find high-quality solutions to this model. Our methodology leverages spatial and temporal decomposition, separating the problem into a set of mixed-integer linear programs for each bus and a set of continuous nonlinear programs for each time period. To improve the performance of the algorithm, we introduce a variety of heuristics, including restrictions of temporal linking constraints, a second-order cone relaxation, and a contingency screening algorithm. We quantify the quality of feasible solutions through a dual bound from a convex second-order cone program. To evaluate our algorithm, we use large-scale test cases from Challenge 3 of the U.S. Department of Energy's Grid Optimization Competition that resemble real power grid data under a variety of operating conditions and decision horizons. The experiments yield feasible solutions with an average optimality gap of 1.33%, demonstrating that this approach generates near-optimal solutions within stringent time limits."

Clow and McKay also showed that the 22 game values born by day 2 correspond to Digraph Placement games with at most 4 vertices. This bound is best possible. We extend this work using a combination of exhaustive and random searches to demonstrate all 1474 values born by day 3 correspond to Digraph Placement games on at most 8 vertices. We provide a combinatorial proof that this bound is best possible. We conclude by giving improved bounds on the number of vertices required to construct all game values born by days 4 and 5."

We restrict our attention to surfaces without boundary, but allow for spontaneous curvature effects. The axisymmetric setting allows us to formulate our schemes in terms of the generating curve of the considered surface. We propose a novel weak formulation, that combines an evolution equation for the surface's mean curvature and the curvature identity of the generating curve. The mean curvature is used to describe the gradient flow structure, which enables an unconditional stability result for the discrete solutions. The generating curve's curvature, on the other hand, describes the surface's in-plane principal curvature and plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier for an equidistribution property on the discrete level. We introduce two fully discrete schemes and prove their unconditional stability. Numerical results are provided to confirm the convergence, stability and equidistribution properties of the introduced schemes."

However, in the case of scattering by trapping obstacles, the Helmholtz solution exhibits nearly-real complex resonances -- which significantly slows the convergence of numerical inverse transform. To address this difficulty this paper introduces a frequency-domain singularity subtraction technique that regularizes the integrand of the inverse transform and efficiently computes the singularity contribution via a combination of a straightforward and inexpensive numerical technique together with a large-time asymptotic expansion. Crucially, all relevant complex resonances and their residues are determined via rational approximation of integral equation solutions at real frequencies. An adaptive algorithm is employed to ensure that all relevant complex resonances are properly identified."

2505.06187,Preferential Attachment Trees with Vertex Death: Persistence of the Maximum Degree,['math.PR'],['Bas Lodewijks'],"We consider an evolving random discrete tree model called Preferential Attachment with Vertex Death, as introduced by Deijfen. Initialised with an alive root labelled $1$, at each step $n\geq1$ either a new vertex with label $n+1$ is introduced that attaches to an existing alive vertex selected preferentially according to a function $b$, or an alive vertex is selected preferentially according to a function $d$ and killed. In this article we introduce a generalised concept of persistence for evolving random graph models. Let $O_n$ be the smallest label among all alive vertices (the oldest alive vertex), and let $I_n^m$ be the label of the alive vertex with the $m^{\mathrm{th}}$ largest degree. We say a persistent $m$-hub exists if $I_n^m$ converges almost surely, we say that persistence occurs when $I_n^1/O_n$ is tight, and that lack of persistence occurs when $I_n^1/O_n$ tends to infinity. We identify two regimes called the infinite lifetime and finite lifetime regimes. In the infinite lifetime regime, vertices are never killed with positive probability. Here, we provide conditions under which we prove the (non-)existence of persistent $m$-hubs for any $m\in\mathbb N$. This expands and generalises recent work of Iyer, which covers the case $d\equiv 0$ and $m=1$. In the finite lifetime regime, vertices are killed after a finite number of steps almost surely. Here we provide conditions under which we prove the occurrence of persistence, which complements recent work of Heydenreich and the author, where lack of persistence is studied for preferential attachment with vertex death."

How']","Aerocapture consists of converting a hyperbolic approach trajectory into a captured target orbit utilizing the aerodynamic forces generated via a single pass through the atmosphere. Aerocapture guidance systems must be robust to significant environmental variations and modeling uncertainty, particularly regarding atmospheric properties and delivery conditions. Recent work has shown that enabling control over both bank angle and angle of attack, a strategy referred to as augmented bank angle modulation (ABAM), can improve robustness to entry state and atmospheric uncertainties. In this work, we derive optimal control solutions for an aerocapture vehicle using ABAM. We first formulate the problem using a linear aerodynamic model and derive closed-form optimal control profiles using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. To increase modeling fidelity, we also consider a quadratic aerodynamic model and obtain the solution directly using the optimality conditions. Both formulations are solved numerically using Gauss pseudospectral methods (via GPOPS, a software tool for pseudospectral optimal control), to validate the analytic solutions. We then introduce a novel aerocapture guidance algorithm, ABAMGuid+, which indirectly minimizes propellant usage by mimicking the structure of the optimal control solution, enabling efficient guidance by avoiding the complexity of solving the full optimal control problem online. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a Uranus aerocapture mission demonstrate that ABAMGuid+ increases capture success rates and reduces post-capture propellant requirements relative to previous methods."

The proposed approach utilizes the convergent Rayleigh inverse iterative formulation introduced by Abedin and Kitagawa as the prototype. More importantly, it employs an error tolerance criterion of inexact Aleksandrov solutions to approximately solve the subproblems without spoiling the convergence, which becomes the most crucial issue for the efficient implementation of the iterative method. For the two-dimensional case, by properly taking advantage of the flexibility rendered by the proposed inexact approach and a convergent fixed-point-based approach to solve the subproblems, considerable advancements in computational efficiency can be achieved by the inexact AKI method with its convergence under the ${\cal C}^{2,α}$ boundary condition being rigorously established. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed inexact AKI method. The numerical results suggest that the inexact AKI method can be more than eight times faster than the original AKI method, at least for all the tested problems."
2505.06156,Representation of tensor functions using lower-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group,"['math.RT', 'cond-mat.mtrl-sci']","['Mohammad Madadi', 'Lin Cheng', 'Pu Zhang']","The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc."

We prove that this problem can be described by an equation using a Lagrange multiplier and a characteristic function. The Lagrange multiplier contains information about the contact set of the modulus of the gradient of the solution with the gradient constraint, and the characteristic function is defined in the contact set of the solution with the obstacle. Moreover, given a convergent sequence of data, we prove the stability of the corresponding solutions."
2505.06147,A categorification of combinatorial Auslander-Reiten quivers,['math.RT'],['Ricardo Canesin'],"We provide a categorification of Oh and Suh's combinatorial Auslander-Reiten quivers in the simply laced case. We work within the perfectly valued derived category $\mathrm{pvd}(Π_Q)$ of the 2-dimensional Ginzburg dg algebra of a Dynkin quiver $Q$. For any commutation class $[i]$ of reduced words in the corresponding Weyl group, we define a subcategory $C([i])$ of $\mathrm{pvd}(Π_Q)$ whose objects are obtained by applying a sequence of spherical twist functors to the simple objects. We describe the Hom-order for $C([i])$ in terms of $[i]$, generalizing a result of Bédard. Furthermore, when $[i]$ is a commutation class for the longest element, we construct a category $D([i])$ generalizing the bounded derived category of $Q$. It is realized as a certain subquotient of $\mathrm{pvd}(Π_Q)$. We demonstrate the existence of particular distinguished triangles in $\mathrm{pvd}(Π_Q)$ with corners in $D([i])$, which allows us to extend the classical mesh-additivity to arbitrary commutation classes. Additionally, we define an analog of the Euler form and prove that its symmetrization yields the corresponding Cartan-Killing form. For commutation classes $[i]$ arising from Q-data, a generalization of Dynkin quivers with a height function introduced by Fujita and Oh, we establish the existence of a partially Serre functor on $D([i])$. Lastly, we apply our results to reinterpret a formula by Fujita and Oh for the inverse of the quantum Cartan matrix."

We then develop a strategy for solving the inverse problem for the Schrödinger equation using this method with other techniques of the Boundary control method."

For a closed $m$-quasi Einstein manifold of dimension $n \ge 2$, if $X$ is conformal, then it is Killing; and in addition, if $M$ admits a non-Killing conformal vector field $V$, then it is globally isometric to a sphere and $V$ is gradient for $n > 2$. Finally, we derive an integral identity for a vector field on a closed Riemannian manifold, which provides a direct proof of the Bourguignon-Ezin conservation identity."

If instead we are given elements $x,y,z \in G$ such that $xy = z$, whose respective orders divide integers $k,l,m \geq 2$, and are given an integer $r$ that is coprime to $k,l$ and $m$, then there exist $x'$, $y'$ and $z'$ conjugate to respectively $x^r$, $y^r$ and $z^r$ such that $x'y' = z'$.

Our primary goal is to characterize these function spaces-as well as the corresponding convolutor and multiplier spaces-through mollification. For this purpose, we introduce the moment-wise decomposition factorization property for pairs of compactly supported smooth functions, and establish complete characterizations in terms of mollifications with these windows."
2505.06106,Unconditionally local bounds preserving numerical scheme based on inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for advection on networks,['math.NA'],"['Peter Frolkovič', 'Svetlana Krišková', 'Katarína Lacková']","We derive an implicit numerical scheme for the solution of advection equation where the roles of space and time variables are exchanged using the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure. The scheme contains a linear weight for which it is always second order accurate in time and space, and the stencil in the implicit part is fully upwinded for any value of the weight, enabling a direct computation of numerical solutions by forward substitution. To fulfill the local bounds for the solution represented by the discrete minimum and maximum principle (DMP), we use a predicted value obtained with the linear weight and check a priori if the DMP is valid. If not, we can use either a nonlinear weight or a limiter function that depends on Courant number and apply such a high-resolution version of the scheme to obtain a corrected value. The advantage of the scheme obtained with the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure is that only in the case of too small Courant numbers, the limiting is towards the first order accurate scheme, which is not a situation occurring in numerical simulations with implicit schemes very often. In summary, the local bounds are satisfied up to rounding errors unconditionally for any Courant numbers, and the formulas for the predictor and the corrector are explicit. The high-resolution scheme can be extended straightforwardly for advection with nonlinear retardation coefficient with numerical solutions satisfying the DMP, and a scalar nonlinear algebraic equation has to be solved to obtain each predicted and corrected value. In numerical experiments, including transport on a sewer network, we can confirm the advantageous properties of numerical solutions for several representative examples."
2505.06104,Two stability theorems on plethysms of Schur functions,"['math.CO', 'math.RT']","['Rowena Paget', 'Mark Wildon']","The plethysm product of Schur functions corresponds to composing polynomial representations of infinite general linear groups.

We prove two stability theorems for plethysm coefficients under the operations of adding and/or joining an arbitrary partition to either $μ$ or $ν$. In both theorems $μ$ may be replaced with an arbitrary skew partition. As special cases we obtain all stability results on the plethysm product of two Schur functions in the literature to date. The proofs are entirely combinatorial using plethystic semistandard tableaux with positive and negative entries."

The packing chromatic number of $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ which admits a packing $k$-coloring of $G$. In this paper, the packing chromatic number of the unitary Cayley graph of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is computed. Two metaheuristic algorithms for calculating the packing chromatic number are also proposed."

By developing a new variational approach, we show that the problem has a family of normalized multi-bump solutions focused on the isolated part of the local maximum of the potential $Q(x)$ for sufficiently small $ε>0$. The asymptotic behavior of the solutions as $ε\rightarrow0$ are also explored. It is worth noting that our results encompass the sublinear case $p<2$, which complements some of the previous works."

This connection was explained in terms of operadic Koszul duality by Fresse, and later generalized by Vallette to the setting of decorated partitions. In this article, we set up and study a general formalism which produces a priori operadic structures (operads and operadic modules) on the cohomology of families of posets equipped with some natural recursive structure, that we call ""operadic poset species"". This framework goes beyond decorated partitions and operadic Koszul duality, and contains the metabelian Lie operad and Kontsevich's operad of trees as two simple instances. In forthcoming work, we will apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to post-Lie and pre-Lie algebras."
2505.06088,Approximations for the number of maxima and near-maxima in independent data,"['math.PR', 'math.ST']",['Fraser Daly'],"In the setting where we have $n$ independent observations of a random variable $X$, we derive explicit error bounds in total variation distance when approximating the number of observations equal to the maximum of the sample (in the case where $X$ is discrete) or the number of observations within a given distance of an order statistic of the sample (in the case where $X$ is absolutely continuous). The logarithmic and Poisson distributions are used as approximations in the discrete case, with proofs which include the development of Stein's method for a logarithmic target distribution. In the absolutely continuous case our approximations are by the negative binomial distribution, and are established by considering negative binomial approximation for mixed binomials. The cases where $X$ is geometric, Gumbel and uniform are used as illustrative examples."
2505.06083,Towards time series aggregation with exact error quantification for optimization of energy systems,['math.OC'],"['Beltrán Castro Gómez', 'Yannick Werner', 'Sonja Wogrin']","Energy system optimization models are becoming increasingly popular for analyzing energy markets, such as the impact of new policies or interactions between energy carriers. One key challenge of these models is the trade-off between modeling accuracy and computational tractability. A recently proposed mathematical framework addresses this challenge by achieving exact time series aggregations merging time periods sharing the same active constraint sets. This aggregation, however, is insufficient when the number of unique active constraints is large. We overcome this issue by aggregating data points from different active constraint sets. While this further reduces model size, it inevitably introduces an error compared to the full model. Yet, we show how this error can be exactly quantified without re-solving the optimization problem, enabling users to trade off computational efficiency and model accuracy proactively. This may be especially useful in energy markets to accommodate varying granularity across short- and long-term time horizons."

This approach represents vector fields as linear combinations of frame elements constructed using the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on smooth functions, along with their gradients. Such reconstructed vector fields generate dynamical flows that consistently approximate the true system, while being compatible with the nonlinear geometry of the manifold. The data-driven implementation of this framework utilizes embedded data points and tangent vectors as training data, along with a graph-theoretic approximation of the Laplacian. In this paper, we prove the convergence of the SEC-based reconstruction in the limit of large data. Moreover, we illustrate the approach numerically with applications to dynamical systems on the unit circle and the 2-torus. In these examples, the reconstructed vector fields compare well with the true vector fields, in terms of both pointwise estimates and generation of orbits."
2505.06059,Functoriality of Enriched Data Types,"['math.CT', 'cs.LO']","['Lukas Mulder', 'Paige Randall North', 'Maximilien Péroux']","In previous work, categories of algebras of endofunctors were shown to be enriched in categories of coalgebras of the same endofunctor, and the extra structure of that enrichment was used to define a generalization of inductive data types. These generalized inductive data types are parametrized by a coalgebra $C$, so we call them $C$-inductive data types; we call the morphisms induced by their universal property $C$-inductive functions. We extend that work by incorporating natural transformations into the theory: given a suitable natural transformation between endofunctors, we show that this induces enriched functors between their categories of algebras which preserve $C$-inductive data types and $C$-inductive functions. Such $C$-inductive data types are often finite versions of the corresponding inductive data type, and we show how our framework can extend classical initial algebra semantics to these types. For instance, we show that our theory naturally produces partially inductive functions on lists, changes in list element types, and tree pruning functions."

The class of Gaussian noises under consideration allows for long-range correlations. We show that the largest eigenvalues converge to a Poisson point process and we obtain a very precise description of the associated eigenfunctions near their localisation centres. We also relate these localisation centres with the locations of the maxima of the noise. Actually, our analysis reveals that this relationship depends in a subtle way on the behaviour near $0$ of the covariance function of the noise: in some situations, the largest eigenfunctions are not associated with the largest values of the noise."

In contrast, the real eigenvalues are described in terms of the roots of a third-degree polynomial with real coefficients. The results of numerical experiments are reported to show the quality of the theoretical bounds and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioners used with GMRES, especially in comparison with similar block diagonal preconditioning strategies along with the MINRES iteration."

Leveraging the well-known Galois connection between operations and relations, we define a small class of \textit{canonical relations} sufficient to describe all Boolean multi-sorted clones up to non-surjective operations. Furthermore, we introduce \textit{elementary operations} on relations, which are less cumbersome than general formulas and have many useful properties. Using these tools, we provide a~new and elementary proof of the famous Post's lattice theorem. We also show that every multi-sorted clone of $k$-tuples of operations decomposes into a surjective part described by canonical relations and $2k$ clones of $(k-1)$-tuples of operations. This structural understanding allows us to describe an embedding of the lattice of multi-sorted clones into a well-understood poset. In particular, we rederive -- by a simpler method -- a~result of V.~Taimanov originally from 1983, showing that every multi-sorted clone on a two-element domain is finitely generated. Finally, we also give a~concise proof of the Galois connection between (surjective) multi-sorted clones and the corresponding closed sets of relations."

  The result provides a positive answer to Problem 20.23 of the Kourovka Notebook [KM22], improves theorems of Garonzi and Maróti [GM21] (using $4$ classes) and Rodgers [Rod02] (using larger classes), complements the known result for $G$ a simple group of Lie type [MP21] [LST24] [FM25], and is tight in several senses. Furthermore, since no character theory is involved, the proof can be used in principle to build a constructive algorithm that, given $g\in G$, outputs $c_{i}\in C_{i}$ such that $c_{1}c_{2}c_{3}=g$."
2505.06011,Construction of exceptional Lie algebra G2 and non-associative algebras using Clifford algebra,['math.RA'],['G. P. Wilmot'],This article uses Clifford algebra of definite signature to derive octonions and the Lie exceptional algebra G2 from calibrations using Pin(7). This is simpler than the usual exterior algebra derivation and uncovers a subalgebra of Spin(7) that enables G2 and an invertible element used to classify six other algebras which are found to be related to the symmetries of G2 in a way that breaks the symmetry of octonions. The 4-form calibration terms of Spin(7) are related to an ideal with three idempotents and provides a direct construction of G2 for each of the 480 representations of the octonions. Clifford algebra thus provides a new construction of G2 without using the Lie bracket. This result is extended to 15 dimensions generating another 100 algebras as well as the sedenions.

While BLO is intractable in its general form, we show that restricting the lower-level objective to the recently proposed PL-circle functions (Gong et al., 2024) guarantees a continuous hyper-objective F_max. The PL-circle condition is strictly weaker than the global Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition used in prior BLO work and allows modeling of practical settings such as hyperparameter tuning in over-parameterized deep learning. However, even under this condition, F_max remains non-convex and non-smooth. To address this, we propose a relaxed solution concept: we approximate F_max with a continuously differentiable function F_max_tilde that is pointwise epsilon_v-close to F_max and seek an epsilon_g-stationary point of F_max_tilde. In this framework, we reduce the minima-selection subproblem to a sampling task using a novel Superquantile-Gibbs relaxation. By leveraging the manifold structure of the lower-level solution set under the PL-circle condition, our method finds a relaxed solution using poly(epsilon_v^{-k} epsilon_g^{-1}) queries to a Gibbs sampling oracle, which is efficiently implemented using Langevin dynamics. Here, k is the intrinsic dimension of the manifolds defining the lower-level solutions. This is the first work to characterize the complexity of BLO in terms of this intrinsic dimensionality."

It can be constructed by setting $h_t:=g_{t/2}g_{t/2}^*$, where $(g_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a free multiplicative Brownian motion, which is the large $N$ limit in non-commutative distribution of the Brownian motion in $\operatorname{Gl}(N,\mathbb{C})$. One key property of $(h_t)_{t\geq0}$ is the fact that the corresponding spectral distributions $(ν_t)_{t\geq0}\subset M^1((0,\infty))$ form a semigroup w.r.t. free multiplicative convolution. In recent work by M. Voit and the present author, it was shown that $ν_t$ can be expressed by the image measure of a free additive convolution of the semicircle and the uniform distribution on an interval under the exponential map. In this paper, we provide a new proof of this result by calculating the moments of the free additive convolution of semicircle and uniform distributions on intervals. As a by-product, we also obtain new integral formulas for $ν_t$ which generalize the corresponding known moment formulas involving Laguerre polynomials."

This general framework encompasses many examples studied in the literature, including Siegel (or $Θ$-) transforms and Marklof-Strömbergsson transforms in the geometry of numbers, Siegel-sVeech transforms for translation surfaces, and Zak transforms in time-frequency analysis.
  Our main applications concern dynamical systems $(X, μ)$ in which the cross section is induced from a separated cross section. We establish criteria for the boundedness, integrability, and square-integrability of the associated Siegel-Radon transforms, and show how these transforms can be used to embed induced $G$-representations into $L^p(X, μ)$ for appropriate values of $p$. These results apply in particular to hulls of approximate lattices and certain ""thinnings"" thereof, including arbitrary positive density subsets in the amenable case.
  In the special case of cut-and-project sets, we derive explicit formulas for the dual transforms, and in the special case of the Heisenberg group we provide isometric embedding of Schrödinger representations into the $L^2$-space of the hulls of positive density subsets of approximate lattices in the Heisenberg group by means of aperiodic Zak transforms."

To this end, we prove that cost controllability of the original system is preserved if proportional bounds on the approximation error hold. Here, proportional refers to state and control, while the respective constants depend on the approximation accuracy. The proportionality of the error bounds is a key element to derive asymptotic stability in presence of modeling errors and not only practical asymptotic stability. Second, we exemplarily verify the imposed assumptions for data-driven surrogates generated with kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition based on the Koopman operator. Hereby, we do not impose invariance assumptions on finite dictionaries, but rather derive all conditions under non-restrictive data requirements. Finally, we verify our findings with numerical simulations."

2505.05921,Limit Theorems for step reinforced random walks with regularly varying memory,"['math.PR', 'math-ph']","['Aritra Majumdar', 'Krishanu Maulik']","For a generalized step reinforced random walk, starting from the origin, the first step is taken according to the first element of an innovation sequence. Then in subsequent epochs, it recalls a past epoch with probability proportional to a regularly varying sequence $\{μ_n\}$ of index $γ>-1$; recalls and repeats the step taken with probability $p$, or with probability $1-p$ takes a fresh step from the innovation sequence. The innovation sequence is assumed to be i.i.d.\ with mean zero. We study the corresponding step reinforced random walk process with linearly scaled time as an r.c.l.l.\ function on $[0, \infty)$. We prove law of large numbers for the linearly scaled process almost surely and in $L^1$ for all possible values of $p$ and $γ$.
  Assuming finite second moments for the innovation sequence, we obtain interesting phase transitions based on the boundedness of a sequence associated with $\{μ_n\}$. The random walk suitably scaled converges almost surely to a process, which may not be Gaussian, when the sequence is bounded and the convergence is in distribution to a Gaussian process otherwise. This phase transition introduces the point of criticality at $p_c=\frac{γ+1/2}{γ+1}$ for $γ>-\frac12$. For the subcritical regime, the process is diffusive, while it is superdiffusive otherwise. However, for the critical regime, the scaled process can converge almost surely or in distribution depending on the choice of sequence $\{μ_n\}$. Almost sure convergence in the critical regime is new. In the critical regime, the scaling can include many more novel choices in addition to $\sqrt{n \log n}$. Further, we use linear time scale and time independent scales even for the critical regime. We argue the exponential time scale for the critical regime is not natural. All the convergences in all the regimes are obtained for the process as an r.c.l.l.\ function."

By doing this, we show that the results presented in [Bal18] can be utilised to construct simplex 3-designs scaling as $d^2$, which suggest a general scaling of $d^{t-1}$.

2505.05878,Multi-armed Bandit for Stochastic Shortest Path in Mixed Autonomy,['math.OC'],"['Yu Bai', 'Yiming Li', 'Xi Xiong']","In mixed-autonomy traffic networks, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are required to make sequential routing decisions under uncertainty caused by dynamic and heterogeneous interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Early-stage greedy decisions made by AVs during interactions with the environment often result in insufficient exploration, leading to failures in discovering globally optimal strategies. The exploration-exploitation balancing mechanism inherent in multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods is well-suited for addressing such problems. Based on the Real-Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) framework, we introduce the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) exploration strategy from the MAB paradigm and propose a novel algorithm. We establish the path-level regret upper bound under the RTDP framework, which guarantees the worst-case convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on a real-world local road network in Shanghai demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively overcomes the failure of standard RTDP to converge to the optimal policy under highly stochastic environments. Moreover, compared to the standard Value Iteration (VI) framework, the RTDP-based framework demonstrates superior computational efficiency. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in routing within large-scale stochastic mixed-autonomy environments."

Such manifolds are usually found using local polynomial approximations and, hence, are limited by the unknown domains of convergence of their Taylor expansions. To address this limitation, we extend local expansions for invariant manifolds via Padé approximants, which re-express the Taylor expansions as rational functions for broader utility. This approach significantly expands the range of applicability of manifold-reduced models, enabling reduced modeling of global phenomena, such as large-scale oscillations and chaotic attractors of finite element models. We illustrate the power of globalized manifold-based model reduction on several equation-driven and data-driven examples from solid mechanics and fluid mechanics."

In this paper, we focus on the analytic properties related to Baxter numbers. We prove that the descent polynomials of Baxter permutations have interlacing zeros, which is a property stronger than real-rootedness. Our approach is based on Dilks' framework of $(q,t)$-Hoggatt sums, which is a $q$-analog for Baxter permutations. Within this framework, we show that the family of $(1,t)$-Hoggatt sums satisfies the interlacing property using fundamental results on Hadamard products of polynomials. For Baxter numbers, we prove their asymptotic $r$-log-convexity via asymptotic expansions of $P$-recursive sequences. In particular, we confirm their $2$-log-convexity using symbolic computation techniques."

2505.05807,Counting subgraphs of coloring graphs using shadow graphs,['math.CO'],['Simon MacLean'],"Given a graph $G$, the $k$-coloring graph $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is constructed by selecting proper $k$-colorings of $G$ as vertices, with an edge between two colorings if they differ in the color of exactly one vertex. The number of vertices in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is the famous chromatic polynomial of $G$. Asgarli, Krehbiel, Levinson and Russell showed that for any subgraph $H$, the number of induced copies of $H$ in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ is a polynomial function in $k$. Hogan, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan found a shorter proof for polynomiality of these chromatic $H$-polynomials. In this paper, we provide a method of constructing these polynomials explicitly in terms of chromatic polynomials of shadow graphs. We illustrate the practicality of our formulas by computing an explicit formula for $H$-polynomial for trees when $H=Q_d$ is an arbitrary hypercube, a task which does not seem approachable from previous methods. The coefficients of the resulting polynomials feature generalized degree sequences introduced by Crew. In the special case when $H=P_2$, the corresponding polynomial is dubbed the chromatic pairs polynomial. We present a pair of graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ sharing the same chromatic pairs polynomial but different chromatic polynomials, disproving a conjecture raised by Asgarli, Krehbiel, Levinson and Russell."

These methods seek numerical approximations to both cell-averages and nodal solutions and evolves them in time simultaneously. It was shown in earlier work that the HV methods are supraconvergent, providing that the discretization uses more unknowns in the upwind direction than the downwind one, similar to the ""upwind condition"" of classical finite-difference schemes. Although it is well known that the stencil of finite-difference methods could not be too biased towards the upwind direction for stability consideration, known as ""stability barrier"", such a barrier has not been established for Hermite-type methods. In this work, we first show by numerical evidence that a similar barrier exists for HV methods and make a conjecture on the sharp bound on the stencil. Next, we prove the existence of stability barrier by showing that the semi-discretized HV methods are unstable given a stencil sufficiently biased towards the upwind direction. Tighter barriers are then proved using combinatorical tools, and finally we extend the analysis to studying other Hermite-type methods built on approximating nodal solutions and derivatives, such as those widely used in Hermite WENO methods."

In addition, we prove a joint dilation theorem for commuting tuples of $\text{Ritt}_{\text{E}}$ operators on a broad class of Banach spaces.

2505.05770,On the structure of complex spectra and eigenfunctions of transfer and Koopman operators,"['math.DS', 'math.PR']","['Matheus M Castro', 'Gary Froyland']","Complex spectra of transfer and Koopman operators describe rotational motion in dynamical systems. A particularly relevant situation in applications is where the rotation speed depends on the position in the phase space. We consider a canonical model of such dynamics in the presence of small noise, and provide precise characterisations of the eigenspectrum and eigenfunctions of the corresponding transfer operators. Further, we study the limiting behaviour of the eigenspectrum and eigenfunctions in the zero-noise limit, including their quadratic and linear response. Our results clarify the structure of transfer and Koopman operator eigenspectra, and provide new interpretations for applications. Our theorems on support localisation of the eigenfunctions yield simple algorithms to detect the existence and phase-space location of approximately cyclic motion with distinct periods. Our response results demonstrate that information on the cycle periods and their locations determined by the operator eigendata is largely insensitive to the noise level. We believe the mechanisms creating the eigendata apply more broadly and enhance our understanding of approximate cycle detection in dynamical systems with operator methods."

In this case, we show that the Hausdorff dimension of the Kakeya set is at least $n - s$. Furthermore, using the ""bush argument"", we improve the lower bound to $\max \{ n - s, n - g_n(s)\}$, where $g_n(s)$ is defined inductively. For example, when $n = 4$, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension is at least $\max\{\frac{19}{5} - \frac{3}{5}s,4-s\}$. We also establish Kakeya maximal function analogues of these results."

For many planar lattice graphs, we show these bounds are easy to compute and provide excellent numerical estimates for the spanning tree entropy."
2505.05685,Convergence from the Log-Gamma Polymer to the Directed Landscape,['math.PR'],['Xinyi Zhang'],"We define the log-gamma sheet and the log-gamma landscape in terms of the 2-parameter and 4-parameter free energy of the log-gamma polymer model and prove that they converge to the Airy sheet and the directed landscape, which are central objects in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our proof of convergence to the Airy sheet relies on the invariance of free energy through the geometric RSK correspondence and the monotonicity of the free energy. To upgrade the convergence to the directed landscape, tail bounds in both spatial and temporal directions are required. However, due to the lack of scaling invariance in the discrete log-gamma polymer--unlike the Brownian setting of the O'Connell-Yor model--existing on-diagonal fluctuation bounds are insufficient. We therefore develop new off-diagonal local fluctuation estimates for the log-gamma polymer."

2505.05662,Enumerative Chromatic Choosability,['math.CO'],"['Sarah Allred', 'Jeffrey A. Mudrock']","Chromatic-choosablility is a notion of fundamental importance in list coloring. A graph is chromatic-choosable when its chromatic number is equal to its list chromatic number. In 1990, Kostochka and Sidorenko introduced the list color function of a graph $G$, denoted $P_{\ell}(G,m)$, which is the list analogue of the chromatic polynomial of $G$, $P(G,m)$. It is known that for any graph $G$ there is a positive integer $k$ such that $P_{\ell}(G,m) = P(G,m)$ whenever $m \geq k$. In this paper, we study enumerative chromatic-choosability. A graph $G$ is enumeratively chromatic-choosable when $P_{\ell}(G,m) = P(G,m)$ whenever $m \in \mathbb{N}$. We completely determine the graphs of chromatic number two that are enumeratively chromatic-choosable. We construct examples of graphs that are chromatic-choosable but fail to be enumeratively-chromatic choosable, and finally, we explore a conjecture as to whether for every graph $G$, there is a $p \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the join of $G$ and $K_p$ is enumeratively chromatic-choosable. The techniques we use to prove results are diverse and include probabilistic ideas and ideas from DP (or correspondence)-coloring."

The proposed method is unconditionally energy stable and, under a sharp discrete regularity condition, achieves second order accuracy with respect to the constraint violation. Furthermore, the method accommodates variable step sizes to speed up the convergence to stationary points and to improve the accuracy of the numerical solutions near singularities, without affecting the unconditional energy stability and the constraint violation property. We illustrate the accuracy in approximating the unit-length constraint and the performance of the method through a series of numerical experiments, and compare it with the linearly implicit Euler and two-step BDF methods."

In 2006, Kamae and Rao examined the maximal pattern complexity of sequences over larger alphabets and showed that sequences which have maximal pattern complexity less than $\ell k$, for $\ell$ the size of the alphabet, must have some periodic structure. In this paper, we investigate the structure of sequences of low maximal pattern complexity over $\ell$ letters where $\liminf\limits\limits_{k \to \infty} p_α^*(k) - 3k = -\infty$. In addition, we show that the minimal maximal pattern complexity of an aperiodic sequence which uses all $\ell$ letters is $p_α^*(k) = 2k + \ell -2$, and give an exact structure for aperiodic sequences with this maximal pattern complexity."
2505.05624,Stability analyses of divergence and vorticity damping on gnomonic cubed-sphere grids,"['math.NA', 'physics.ao-ph']","['Timothy C. Andrews', 'Christiane Jablonowski']","Divergence and vorticity damping, which operate upon horizontal divergence and relative vorticity, are explicit diffusion mechanisms used in dynamical cores to ensure numerical stability. There are mesh-dependent upper bounds on the coefficients of these diffusion operators, else the diffusion itself instigates model instability. This work considers such stability limits for three gnomonic cubed-sphere meshes -- 1) equidistant, 2) equiangular, and 3) equi-edge mappings. Von Neumann analysis is used to derive linear stability limits, and these depend on the cell areas and aspect ratios of the cubed-sphere grid. The linear theory is compared to practical divergence and vorticity damping limits in NOAA GFDL's finite-volume dynamical core on the cubed-sphere (FV3), using a baroclinic wave initial condition and the equiangular and equi-edge grids. For divergence damping, both the magnitude of maximum stable coefficients and the locations of instability agree with linear theory. Due to implicit vorticity diffusion from the transport scheme, practical limits for vorticity damping are lower than the explicit stability limits. The maximum allowable vorticity damping coefficient is dependent on the choice of horizontal transport scheme for the equi-edge grid; it is hypothesised that this indicates the relative implicit diffusion of the transport scheme in this test."

As an application, letting $R$ to be the ring of $p$-adic integers, we examine some necessary and sufficient conditions for a $p$-group of nilpotency class $2$ to have its set of commutators coincide with its commutator subgroup.

2505.05601,"Counting primes with a given primitive root, uniformly",['math.NT'],"['Steve Fan', 'Paul Pollack']","The celebrated Artin conjecture on primitive roots asserts that given any integer $g$ which is neither $-1$ nor a perfect square, there is an explicit constant $A(g)>0$ such that the number $Π(x;g)$ of primes $p\le x$ for which $g$ is a primitive root is asymptotically $A(g)π(x)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $π(x)$ counts the number of primes not exceeding $x$. Artin's conjecture has remained unsolved since its formulation in 1927. Nevertheless, Hooley demonstrated in 1967 that Artin's conjecture is a consequence of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) for Dedekind zeta functions of certain cyclotomic-Kummer extensions over $\mathbb{Q}$. In this paper, we use GRH to establish a uniform version of the Artin--Hooley asymptotic formula. Specifically, we prove that $Π(x;g) \sim A(g) x/\log{x}$ whenever $\log{x}/\log\log{2|g|} \to \infty$, i.e., whenever $x$ tends to infinity faster than any power of $\log{(2|g|)}$. Under GRH, we also show that the least prime $p_g$ possessing $g$ as a primitive root satisfies the upper bound $p_g=O(\log^{19}(2|g|))$ uniformly for all non-square $g\ne-1$. We conclude with an application to the average value of $p_g$ and a discussion of an analogue concerning the least ""almost-primitive'' root."

Wimmer', 'Ahsan Ali', 'James Brannick', 'Karsten Kahl']","Consider an algebraic two-level method applied to the $n$-dimensional linear system $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ using fine-space preconditioner (i.e., ``relaxation'' or ``smoother'') $M$, with $M \approx A$, restriction and interpolation $R$ and $P$, and algebraic coarse-space operator ${A_c := R^*AP}$. Then, what are the the best possible transfer operators $R$ and $P$ of a given dimension $n_c < n$? Brannick et al. (2018) showed that when $A$ and $M$ are Hermitian positive definite (HPD), the optimal interpolation is such that its range contains the $n_c$ smallest generalized eigenvectors of the matrix pencil $(A, M)$. Recently, in Ali et al. (2025) we generalized this framework to the non-HPD setting, by considering both right (interpolation) and left (restriction) generalized eigenvectors of $(A, M)$ and defining corresponding nonsymmetric transfer operators $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$. Tight convergence bounds for $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$ are derived in spectral radius, as well as a proof of pseudo-optimality. Note, $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$ are typically complex valued, which is not practical for real-valued problems. Here we build on Ali et al. (2025), first characterizing all inner products in which the coarse-space correction defined by $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$ is orthogonal. We then develop tight two-level convergence bounds in these norms, and prove that the underlying transfer operators $\{R_\#,P_\#\}$ are genuinely optimal. As a special case, our theory both recovers and extends the HPD results from Brannick et al. (2018). Finally, we show how to construct optimal, real-valued transfer operators in the case of that $A$ and $M$ are real valued, but are not HPD. Numerical examples arising from discretized advection and wave-equation problems are used to verify and illustrate the theory."

This kind of manifold is also interesting from the point of view of the general theory of relativity. In this article, we introduce electrostatic manifolds with boundary as a natural generalization of static manifolds with boundary in the presence of a non-zero electric field. We study the geometry of the zero-level set of the potential and its connection to the global properties of electrostatic manifolds with boundary. In particular, we establish some rigidity theorems for the 3-dimensional Euclidean ball and for the Reissner-Nordström manifold."

But Schur $σ$-groups can also be constructed and studied abstractly. We prove that if $p>3$, any Schur $σ$-group of Zassenhaus type $(3,3)$, for which every open subgroup has finite abelianization, is isomorphic to an open subgroup of a form of ${\rm PGL}_2$ over ${\mathbb Q}_p$.

2505.05569,A Cohen-Lenstra Heuristic for Schur $σ$-Groups,['math.NT'],"['Richard Pink', 'Luca Ángel Rubio']","For any odd prime $p$ and any imaginary quadratic field $K$, the $p$-tower group $G_K$ associated to $K$ is the Galois group over $K$ of the maximal unramified pro-$p$-extension of $K$. This group comes with an action of a finite group $\{1,σ\}$ of order $2$ induced by complex conjugation and is known to possess a number of other properties, making it a so-called Schur $σ$-group. Its maximal abelian quotient is naturally isomorphic to the $p$-primary part of the narrow ideal class group of ${\mathcal O}_K$, and the Cohen-Lenstra heuristic gives a probabilistic explanation for how often this group is isomorphic to a given finite abelian $p$-group.
  The present paper develops an analogue of this heuristic for the full group $G_K$. It is based on a detailed analysis of general pro-$p$-groups with an action of $\{1,σ\}$, which we call $σ$-pro-$p$-groups. We construct a probability space whose underlying set consists of $σ$-isomorphism classes of weak Schur $σ$-groups and whose measure is constructed from the principle that the relations defining $G_K$ should be randomly distributed according to the Haar measure. We also compute the measures of certain basic subsets, the result being inversely proportional to the order of the $σ$-automorphism group of a certain finite $σ$-$p$-group, as has often been observed before. Finally, we show that the $σ$-isomorphism classes of weak Schur $σ$-groups for which each open subgroup has finite abelianization form a subset of measure $1$."
2505.05545,On a specific family of orthogonal polynomials of Bernstein-Szegö type,['math.CA'],['Martin Nicholson'],"We study a class of weight functions on $[-1,1]$, which are special cases of the general weights studied by Bernstein and Szegö, as well as their extentions to the interval $[-a,1]$ for a continuous parameter $a>0$. These weights are parametrized by two positive integers. As these integers tend to infinity, these weights approximate certain weight functions on $\mathbb{R}$ considered in the earlier literature in connection with orthogonal polynomials related to elliptic functions. It turns out that an orthogonal polynomial of certain degree corresponding to these weights has a particularly simple form with known roots. This fact allows us to find explicit quadrature formulas for these weights and construct measures on $\mathbb{R}$ with identical moments. We also find finite analogs of some improper integrals first studied by Glaisher and Ramanujan, and show that some of the functions used in this work are in fact generating functions of certain finite trigonometric power sums."

This method extends the MeLoCoToN algorithm for inversion and optimization problems with continuous variables, by using Field Tensor Networks. The fundamentals of the method are the conversion of the problem of minimization of $N$ continuous variables into a problem of maximization of a dependent functional of a single variable. It can also be adapted to determine other properties, such as the zeros of any function. For this purpose, we use an extension of the imaginary time evolution, the new method of continuous signals, and partial or total integration, depending on the case. In addition, we show a direct way to recover both the tensor networks and the MeLoCoToN from this formalism. We show some examples of application, such as the Riemann hypothesis resolution. We provide an explicit integral equation that gives the solution of the Riemann hypothesis, being that if it results in a zero value, it is correct; otherwise, it is wrong.

2505.05451,The Brownian marble,['math.PR'],"['Samuel G. G. Johnston', 'Andreas Kyprianou', 'Tim Rogers', 'Emmanuel Schertzer']","Let $R:(0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ be a measurable function. Consider coalescing Brownian motions started from every point in the subset $\{ (0,x) : x \in \mathbb{R} \}$ of $[0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}$ (with $[0,\infty)$ denoting time and $\mathbb{R}$ denoting space) and proceeding according to the following rule: the interval $\{t\} \times [L_t,U_t]$ between two consecutive Brownian motions instantaneously fragments' at rate $R(U_t - L_t)$. At a fragmentation event at a time $t$, we initiate new coalescing Brownian motions from each of the points $\{ (t,x) : x \in [L_t,U_t]\}$. The resulting process, which we call the $R$-marble, is easily constructed when $R$ is bounded, and may be considered a random subset of the Brownian web.
  Under mild conditions, we show that it is possible to construct the $R$-marble when $R$ is unbounded as a limit as $n \to \infty$ of $R_n$-marbles where $R_n(g) = R(g) \wedge n$. The behaviour of this limiting process is mainly determined by the shape of $R$ near zero. The most interesting case occurs when the limit $\lim_{g \downarrow 0} g^2 R(g) = λ$ exists in $(0,\infty)$, in which case we find a phase transition. For $λ\geq 6$, the limiting object is indistinguishable from the Brownian web, whereas if $λ< 6$, then the limiting object is a nontrivial stochastic process with large gaps.
  When $R(g) = λ/g^2$, the $R$-marble is a self-similar stochastic process which we refer to as the \emph{Brownian marble with parameter $λ> 0$}. We give an explicit description of the spacetime correlations of the Brownian marble, which can be described in terms of an object we call the Brownian vein; a spatial version of a recurrent extension of a killed Bessel-$3$ process."

Second, we provide a comprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps, satisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to those obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated metric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length intervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on the edges.

2505.05425,On differentiation of integrals in Lebesgue spaces,['math.CA'],"['Marco Fraccaroli', 'Dariusz Kosz', 'Luz Roncal']","We study the problem of differentiation of integrals for certain bases in the infinite-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^ω$. In particular, for every $p_0 \in [1,\infty)$, we construct a basis $\mathcal{B}$ which differentiates $L^p(\mathbb{T}^ω)$ if and only if $p \geq p_0$, thus reproving classical theorems of Hayes in $\mathbb{R}$. The main novelty is that our $\mathcal{B}$ is a Busemann--Feller basis consisting of rectangles (of arbitrarily large dimensions) with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Our construction gives us the opportunity to classify all possible ranges of differentiation for general complete spaces. Namely, let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis in a metric measure space $\mathcal{X}$. If $\mathcal{X}$ is complete, then the set $\{ p \in [1,\infty] : \mathcal{B} \text{ differentiates } L^p(\mathcal{X}) \}$ takes one of the six forms\[ \emptyset, \, \{\infty\}, \, [p_0,\infty], \, (p_0,\infty], \, [p_0,\infty), \, (p_0,\infty) \quad \text{for some} \quad p_0 \in [1,\infty). \] Conversely, for every $p_0 \in [1,\infty)$ and each of the six cases above, we construct a complete space $\mathcal{X}$ and a basis $\mathcal{B}$ illustrating the corresponding range of differentiation."
2505.05424,An efficient second-order cone programming approach for dynamic optimal transport on staggered grid discretization,['math.OC'],"['Liang Chen', 'Youyicun Lin', 'Yuxuan Zhou']","This paper proposes an efficient numerical method based on second-order cone programming (SOCP) to solve dynamic optimal transport (DOT) problems with quadratic cost on staggered grid discretization. By properly reformulating discretized DOT problems into a linear SOCP, the proposed method eliminates the interpolation matrices and thus avoids solving a series of cubic equations and linear systems induced by interpolation. Then, by taking advantage of the SOCP reformulation, we can solve them efficiently by a computationally highly economical implementation of an inexact decomposition-based proximal augmented Lagrangian method. Moreover, we have made the proposed approach an open-source software package. Numerical experiments on various DOT problems suggest that the proposed approach performs significantly more efficiently than state-of-the-art software packages. In addition, it exhibits prominent robustness to problems with non-negative measures."

A single vehicle is in charge for all pick-up and drop-off operations, and the solution cost is associated with its route, which must also be decided. We provide a general and flexible mathematical optimization based approach for solving the problem that has some peculiarities to assure that the demand is adequately picked up, that some pickup points can be visited multiple times, that the capacity of the vehicle is respected, or that the vehicle is capable to implement the path or tour in the obtained solution. We report the results of a extense battery of experiments to validate our proposal on synthetic instances, and provide some insighs on the usefulness of our approach in practical applications."

Specifically, we focus on computing the power series of non-expansive Perron-Frobenius operators under a given $L^p$-norm with a constant damping parameter in $(0,1)$. We use PINNs and RVPINNs to approximate solutions in their strong and variational forms, respectively. We provide a priori error estimates for quasi-minimizers of the associated loss functions.

We use a generalized version of chip firing to bound the number of invariant factors of the critical group of an arithmetical structure on a graph. We also show that, under suitable hypotheses, critical groups are additive under wedge sums of graphs with arithmetical structures. These results allow us to relate the number of invariant factors of critical groups associated to any given tree to decompositions of the tree into simpler trees. We use this to classify those trees for which every arithmetical structure has cyclic critical group. Finally, we show how to construct arithmetical structures on trees with prescribed critical groups. In particular, every finite abelian group is realized as the critical group of some arithmetical structure on a tree."

Bowtell, Morris, Pehova and Staden proved an analog of Dirac's theorem in this setting, namely that if $δ(G_i)\geq (1/2+o(1))n$ then $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ is Hamilton-universal. Combining McDiarmid's coupling and a colorful version of the Friedman-Pippenger tree embedding technique, we establish a similar result in the setting of sparse random graphs, showing that there exists $C$ such that if the $G_i$ are independent random graphs sampled from $G(n,p)$, where $p\geq C\log n/n$, then $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ is Hamilton-universal with high probability."

To this end, two quasi-incompressible diffuse interface models with singular free energies are analyzed, differing primarily in their velocity averaging. Firstly, to generalize a model by Abels, Garcke, and Grün, a thermodynamically consistent system of Navier--Stokes/Cahn--Hilliard type with source terms is derived in a framework of continuum fluid dynamics, followed by a proof of existence of weak solutions to the latter. Secondly, the quasi-stationary version of a model by Aki, Dreyer, Giesselmann, and Kraus is investigated analytically, with existence of weak solutions being established for the resulting quasi-stationary Stokes system coupled to a Cahn--Hilliard equation with a source term."

Order $S$ by using the Cartesian product of the $t$ standard orders of $[0,1]$. We determine a constant $\bar x(t)<e$ such that, with probability $\ge 1-\exp(-Θ(\eps)n^{1/t})$, cardinality of a largest subset of comparable points is at most $(\bar x(t)+\eps)n^{1/t}$. The bound $\bar x(t)$ complements an explicit lower bound obtained by Bollobás and Winkler in 1982. Furthermore, we use Dilworth's theorem on partitions of a set into chains to prove that the cardinality of a largest antichain, i. e. a largest subset of incomparable points, is at least $(1-\eps) (n/e)^{1-1/t}$ with probability exponentially close to $1$."

Our goal is to reconstruct the optical coefficients, i.e., the diffusion and absorption coefficients, using multiple internal observational data. The foundation of our numerical algorithm lies in solving an inverse diffusivity problem and a direct problem associated with elliptic equations. The stability of the inverse problem depends critically on a non-zero condition in the internal observations, a condition that can be met using randomly chosen boundary excitation data. Utilizing these randomly generated boundary data, we implement an output least squares formulation combined with finite element discretization to solve the inverse problem. In this scenario, we provide a rigorous error estimate in $L^2(Ω)$ norm for the numerical reconstruction using a weighted energy estimate, inspired by the analysis of a newly proposed conditional stability result. The resulting error estimate serves as a valuable guide for selecting appropriate regularization parameters and discretization mesh sizes according to the noise levels present in the data. Several numerical experiments are presented to support our theoretical results and illustrate the effectiveness of our numerical scheme."

It is well known that, in the free case, the associated energy functional has a mountain pass geometry on the $L^2$-sphere. This boils down, in higher dimensions, to the existence of a mountain pass solution which is (a suitable scaling of) the Aubin-Talenti function. In this paper, we consider the same problem, in presence of a weakly attractive, possibly irregular, potential, wondering (i) whether a local minimum solution appears, thus providing an orbitally stable family of solitons, and (ii) if the existence of a mountain-pass solution persists. We provide positive answers, depending on suitable assumptions on the potential and on the mass value.
  Moreover, by the Hopf-Cole transform, we give some applications of our results to the existence of multiple solutions to ergodic Mean Field Games systems with potential and quadratic Hamiltonian."

The use of a Weber model system gives results that are uniform in the eigenvalue parameter over the whole range from the bottom of the potential well up to finite values."
2505.05339,A Counterexample to a Conjecture of Lovász,['math.CO'],"['Alexander Clow', 'Penny Haxell', 'Bojan Mohar']","In 1975 Lovász conjectured that every $r$-partite, $r$-uniform hypergraph contains $r-1$ vertices whose deletion reduces the matching number. If true, this statement would imply a well-known conjecture of Ryser from 1971, which states that every $r$-partite, $r$-uniform hypergraph has a vertex cover of size at most $r-1$ times its matching number. When $r=2$, Ryser's conjecture is simply Kőnig's theorem, and the conjecture of Lovász is an immediate corollary. Ryser's conjecture for $r=3$ was proven by Aharoni in 2001, and remains open for all $r\geq 4$.
  Here we show that the conjecture of Lovász is false in the case $r=3$. Our counterexample is the line hypergraph of the Biggs-Smith graph, a highly symmetric cubic graph on 102 vertices."

For $ α\in (0,1) $, we study regularity estimates of the fractional heat semigroups $ \{ exp (-tL^ {α} )\} _ { t > 0 }$, via the subordination formula and the fundamental solution of the associated uniformly parabolic equation $ \partial_t u + Lu = 0 $. This approach avoids the use of Fourier transforms and is applicable to second-order differential operators whose heat kernels satisfy Gaussian upper bounds. As an application, we characterize the Campanato-type space $Λ_{ L , γ} \left( \mathbb{R}^n \right)$ via the fractional heat semigroups $\{exp ( - t L ^ {α} ) \} _ { t > 0 } $."

As an application, we prove a conjecture of Moseley--Proudfoot--Young that relates the reduced Orlik--Terao algebra of a graph to the cohomology of a certain configuration space. In the second half of the paper, we interpret the Macaulay inverse system of a zonotopal algebra as the space of sections of a sheaf on the Schubert variety of a linear space. As an application of this, we use an equivariant resolution of the structure sheaf of the Schubert variety inside of a product of projective lines to produce an exact sequence relating internal and external zonotopal algebras."

This side condition bounds the oscillation of a weight on the top halves of Carleson squares and allows for the development of a rich theory for Békollé-Bonami weights, analogous to that of Muckenhoupt weights. First, we prove that the side condition can essentially be dropped when the weight is radial and monotonic. Then, by means of counterexamples, we show that the side condition is sharp for non-monotonic weights. In addition, we extend the characterization of the $B_\infty$ class so that it includes all twelve $A_\infty$ conditions recently studied by Duoandikoetxea, Martín-Reyes and Ombrosi, and we present a complete picture of the relationships between these twelve conditions for arbitrary weights on the unit disc. Finally, we use our results to prove an analogue of the self-improvement property of Muckenhoupt weights for monotonic Békollé-Bonami weights."

Our goal is to determine a route for a single crew to visit and repair the disruptions to restore service with minimum negative impact. We call this problem the Traveling Repairman Network Restoration Problem (TRNRP). This problem presents strong computational challenges due to the combinatorial nature of the decisions, inter-dependencies within the underlying infrastructure network, and incomplete information. Considering the dynamic nature of the decisions as a result of dynamic information revelation on the status of the nodes, we model this problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. Our solution approach uses value approximation based on reinforcement learning, which is strengthened by structural results that identify a set of suboptimal moves. In addition, we propose state aggregation methods to reduce the size of the state space. We perform extensive computational studies to characterize the performance of our solution methods under different parameter settings and to compare them with benchmark solution approaches."

Then, with the help of periodic measures and periodic Riccati equations, we transform the ergodic cost functional on infinite horizon into an equivalent cost functional on a single periodic interval without limit, and present the closed-loop optimal controls for our concerned control system.

We prove an isoperimetric inequality for $λ_1^g(Ω)$, which provides a uniform bound on twisted eigenvalues -- not only with respect to the domain $Ω$ (an open bounded set of $\mathbb R^d$) -- but also in relation to the orthogonality function $g$. Remarkably, the lower bound is uniquely attained when $Ω$ is the union of two disjoint balls of specific radii, and when the function $g$ in the orthogonality constraint is of bang-bang type, i.e., constant on each ball. As a consequence, we obtain a continuous 1-parameter family of optimal sets -- each being the union of two disjoint balls -- that interpolates between the optimal shapes of the first two Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian.
  This new isoperimetric inequality offers fresh perspectives on well established results, such as the Hong-Krahn-Szegő and the Freitas-Henrot inequalities. Notably, in these particular cases our proof avoids reliance on Bessel functions, suggesting potential extensions to nonlinear settings."

Given a graph H, the Turan number of H in Q_n, denoted by ex(Q_n, H), is the maximum number of edges of a subgraph of Q_n that is H-free. A double star S_{k,l} is the graph obtained by taking an edge uv and joining u with k vertices, v with l vertices which are different from the k vertices.

2505.05261,ICNN-enhanced 2SP: Leveraging input convex neural networks for solving two-stage stochastic programming,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']","['Yu Liu', 'Fabricio Oliveira']","Two-stage stochastic programming (2SP) offers a basic framework for modelling decision-making under uncertainty, yet scalability remains a challenge due to the computational complexity of recourse function evaluation. Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations."

We first derive the scaled boundary formulation for 3D seepage problems, and subsequently incorporate Wachspress shape functions to construct shape functions over arbitrary polygonal elements, thereby establishing the foundation of the proposed polyhedral SBFEM. The method combines the semi-analytical nature of the SBFEM with the geometric flexibility of polyhedral and octree meshes, making it well-suited for complex seepage simulations. The PSBFEM is implemented within the ABAQUS UEL framework to facilitate steady-state, transient, and free-surface seepage analyses. A series of numerical examples are conducted to verify the accuracy, efficiency, and convergence properties of the proposed approach, including benchmark tests and applications with intricate geometries. The results demonstrate that the PSBFEM achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than conventional FEM, particularly when using hybrid octree meshes with local refinement. This framework provides a robust and efficient computational tool for three-dimensional seepage analysis in geotechnical and hydraulic engineering applications."

2505.05234,Weighting operators for sparsity regularization,['math.NA'],"['Ole Løseth Elvetun', 'Bjørn Fredrik Nielsen', 'Niranjana Sudheer']","Standard regularization methods typically favor solutions which are in, or close to, the orthogonal complement of the null space of the forward operator/matrix $\mathsf{A}$. This particular biasedness might not be desirable in applications and can lead to severe challenges when $\mathsf{A}$ is non-injective.
  We have therefore, in a series of papers, investigated how to ""remedy"" this fact, relative to a chosen basis and in a certain mathematical sense: Based on a weighting procedure, it turns out that it is possible to modify both Tikhonov and sparsity regularization such that each member of the chosen basis can be almost perfectly recovered from their image under $\mathsf{A}$. In particular, we have studied this problem for the task of using boundary data to identify the source term in an elliptic PDE. However, this weighting procedure involves $\mathsf{A}^\dagger \mathsf{A}$, where $\mathsf{A}^\dagger$ denotes the pseudo inverse of $\mathsf{A}$, and can thus be CPU-demanding and lead to undesirable error amplification.
  We therefore, in this paper, study alternative weighting approaches and prove that some of the recovery results established for the methodology involving $\mathsf{A}$ hold for a broader class of weighting schemes.

Our previous studies showed that the formulation is unconditionally stable in time and that its mixed finite element discretization is well-posed. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of the condition number with respect to mesh refinement. Moreover, we observe that our formulation does not need any stabilization term in presence of small cut cells and conditioning is not affected by the interface position."

Pavliotis', 'Andrea Zanoni']","We consider the problem of inferring the interaction kernel of stochastic interacting particle systems from observations of a single particle. We adopt a semi-parametric approach and represent the interaction kernel in terms of a generalized Fourier series. The basis functions in this expansion are tailored to the problem at hand and are chosen to be orthogonal polynomials with respect to the invariant measure of the mean-field dynamics. The generalized Fourier coefficients are obtained as the solution of an appropriate linear system whose coefficients depend on the moments of the invariant measure, and which are approximated from the particle trajectory that we observe. We quantify the approximation error in the Lebesgue space weighted by the invariant measure and study the asymptotic properties of the estimator in the joint limit as the observation interval and the number of particles tend to infinity, i.e. the joint large time-mean field limit. We also explore the regime where an increasing number of generalized Fourier coefficients is needed to represent the interaction kernel. Our theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical simulations."

For a graph with rational weights, the decision problem of whether the SDP relaxation for the maximum cut problem is exact is known to be NP-hard; however its complexity was unresolved for unweighted graphs. In this work, we extend the NP-hardness result to unweighted graphs. We characterize a few classes of graphs for which the SDP relaxation is exact. For each of these graph classes, we establish conditions for uniqueness of the SDP optimum. We complement these findings by identifying two graph operations that preserve the solution rank, and in turn exactness. These results reveal how the SDP relaxation for the maximum cut problem can remain exact in arbitrarily large graphs, owing to the presence of a small structural core that governs exactness. We further address two open problems posed by Mirka and Williamson (2024), by demonstrating that uniqueness of the maximum cut partition in exact relaxation does not imply uniqueness of the SDP optimum, and that exact relaxation with multiple optimal partitions may admit optimal SDP solutions lying outside the convex hull of rank-1 reference solutions."

Whilst insisting on an asymptotically optimal order of magnitude for $m$ required to attain {\sl unique reconstruction} via $\ell_1$-minimisation algorithms, our results track the level of arbitrariness allowed for the fixed seed matrix $M$ as well as the degree of distributional irregularity allowed for the entries of the perturbing matrix $R$. Starting with sub-gaussian entries for $R$, our results culminate with these allowed to have substantially heavier tails than sub-exponential ones. Throughout this trajectory, two measures control the arbitrariness allowed for $M$; the first is $\|M\|_\infty$ and the second is a localised notion of the Frobenius norm of $M$ (which depends on the sparsity of the signal being reconstructed).

A time-weighted energy argument has been developed within the $L^2$ framework to derive the optimal time-decay rates, which enables us to remove the smallness of low-frequencies of initial data. A great part of our analysis relies on the study of a Lyapunov functional in the spirit of [13], which mainly depends on some elaborate use of non-classical Besov product estimates and interpolations. Exhibiting a damped mode with faster time decay than the whole solution also plays a key role."

The extrinsic local linear Fréchet functional regression predictor is obtained in the time-varying tangent space by projection into an orthornormal eigenfunction basis in the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fréchet mean approach is adopted in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fréchet functional regression predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is also proved. The finite sample size performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and intrinsic local functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fréchet curve predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. As motivating real data application, we consider the prediction problem of the Earth's magnetic field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft."

While it is known that such a steady state is unstable in $H^2$, our result establishes a sharp stability threshold in higher-order Sobolev spaces.
  The key ingredients of our proof are twofold. First, we extract long-time convergence from the decay of a potential energy functional$-$despite its non-coercive nature$-$thereby revealing a variational structure underlying the dynamics. Second, we derive refined commutator estimates to control the evolution of higher Sobolev norms throughout the full range of $k>2$."

This model arises from the mathematical description of the behavior of synovial fluid in the cavities of articulating joints. We prove the existence of a local-in-time strong solution in a three-dimensional spatially periodic domain, assuming that $\frac{7}{5} < p^- \le p(\cdot) \le p^+ \le 2$, where $p(\cdot)$ denotes the variable power-law index and $p^-$ and $p^+$ are its lower and upper bounds, respectively. Furthermore, we prove the uniqueness of the solution under the additional condition $p^+ < \frac{28}{15}$.

An input--output map $R: u_1(0,\cdot)\mapsto u_2(0,\cdot)$ is of the convolution form $Rf=if+r\ast f$, where $r=r(t)$ is a {\it response function}. By hyperbolicity of the system, for any $T>0$, function $r\big|_{0 {\leqslant} t {\leqslant} 2T}$ is determined by $p,q\big|_{0 {\leqslant} x {\leqslant} T}$.
  An inverse problem is: for an (arbitrary) fixed $T>0$, given $r\big|_{0 {\leqslant} t {\leqslant} 2T}$ to recover $p,q\big|_{0 {\leqslant} x {\leqslant} T}$. The procedure that determines $p,q$ is proposed, and the characteristic solvability conditions on $r$ are provided.
  Our approach is purely time-domain and is based on studying the controllability properties of the Dirac system. In itself the system is not controllable: the local completeness of states does not hold, but its relevant extension gains controllability. It is the fact, which enables one to apply the boundary control method for solving the inverse problem."

Here we develop a high-order Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction method on Cartesian grids for solving special relativistic hydrodynamics equations with several general equations of state available in the literature. We also study the conversion from conservative to primitive variables, which depends on the equation of state in use, and provide an alternative method of conversion when the existing approach does not succeed. For the admissibility of the solution, we blend the high-order method with a low-order method on sub-cells and prove its physical admissible property in the case of all the equations of state used here. Lastly, we validate the scheme by several test cases having strong discontinuities, large Lorentz factor, and low density or pressure in one and two dimensions."

It is said to be proper if there exists at least one non-collinear point pair, and at least one line incident with more than two points. The highest degree of symmetry for a proper partial linear space occurs when the automorphism group $G$ is transitive on ordered pairs of collinear points, and on ordered pairs of non-collinear points, that is to say, $G$ is a transitive rank $3$ group on the points. While the primitive rank 3 partial linear spaces are essentially classified, we present the first substantial classification of a family of imprimitive rank $3$ examples.
  We classify all imprimitive rank $3$ proper partial linear spaces such that the rank $3$ group is semiprimitive. In particular, this includes all partial linear spaces with a rank 3 imprimitive automorphism group that is innately transitive or quasiprimitive. We construct several infinite families of examples and ten individual examples. The examples in the infinite families admit a rank $3$ action of a linear or unitary group, and to our knowledge most of these examples have not appeared before in the literature."

This inverse problem finds its motivation in the reconstruction of mechanical properties of tissues in medical diagnostics. We first assume that the Lamé parameters ($λ, μ$) are know and we look for the inverse problem of recovering the density $ρ$. In this context, we derive a constrcutive Lipschitz stability estimate in terms of the Neumann to Dirichlet map in the case of piecewise constant parameters. Then, we look for the inverse problem of recovering $λ$, $μ$ and $ρ$ simultameousely.
  We establish Lipschitz stability estimate, provided that the parameters $λ$, $μ$ and $ρ$ have upper and lower bounds and belong to a known finite-dimensional subspace. The proofs hinge on monotonicity relations between the parameters and the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, coupled with the techniques of localized potentials."

This method achieves second-order accuracy and offers substantial computational advantages over both direct solvers and finite-difference-based multigrid methods. A key strength of the ghost finite element framework is its variational formulation, which naturally enables consistent transfer operators and avoids residual splitting across grid levels. We provide a detailed construction of the multigrid components in both one and two spatial dimensions, including smoothers, transfer operators, and coarse grid operators. The choice of the stabilization parameter plays a crucial role in ensuring well-posedness and optimal convergence of the multigrid method. We derive explicit algebraic expressions for this parameter based on the geometry of cut cells. In the two-dimensional setting, we further improve efficiency by performing additional smoothing exclusively on cut cells, reducing computational cost without compromising convergence. Numerical results validate the proposed method across a range of geometries and confirm its robustness and scalability."

The spectra of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We approach this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis."

  We characterize the tangent and normal cones of orthocentric simplices in terms of orthocentric cones with explicit parameters. Depending on whether the orthocenter lies inside the simplex, on its boundary, or outside, the simplex is classified as acute, rectangular, or obtuse, respectively. The solid angle formulas differ in these three cases.
  As a probabilistic application of the angle formulas, we explicitly compute the expected number of $k$-dimensional faces and the expected volume of the random polytope $[g_1/τ_1, \ldots, g_n/τ_n]$, where $g_1, \ldots, g_n$ are independent standard Gaussian vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and $τ_1, \ldots, τ_n > 0$ are constants."

Traditional Importance Sampling (IS) often suffers from poor performance since it heavily relies on the choice of the proposal distributions. The AMIS and the Modified version of AMIS (MAMIS) address this by iteratively refining proposal distributions and reusing all past samples through a recycling strategy. We introduce the RQMC methods into the MAMIS, achieving higher convergence rates compared to the Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Our main contributions include a detailed convergence analysis of the MAMIS estimator under randomized QMC (RQMC) sampling. Specifically, we establish the $L^q$ $(q \geq 2)$ error bound for the RQMC-based estimator using a smoothed projection method, which enables us to apply the Hölder's inequality in the error analysis of the RQMC-based MAMIS estimator. As a result, we prove that the root mean square error of the RQMC-based MAMIS estimator converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\bar{N}_T^{-1+ε})$, where $\bar{N}_T$ is the average number of samples used in each step over $T$ iterations, and $ε> 0$ is arbitrarily small.

This paper provides a geometric realization of the mirror Picard group action in this correspondence, characterizing it in terms of quantized contact isotopies and providing a sheaf-theoretic counterpart to work of Hanlon in the Fukaya-Seidel setting. Given a toric Cartier divisor $D$, we consider a family of homogeneous Hamiltonians $H_\varepsilon$ on $T^* T^n$. Their flows act on sheaves via a family of kernels $K_\varepsilon$ on $T^n \times T^n$. The nearby cycles kernel $K_0$ corresponds heuristically to the Hamiltonian flow of the non-differentiable function $\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} H_\varepsilon$, which is the pullback of the support function of $D$ along the cofiber projection. We show that the action of $K_0$ coincides with the convolution action of the associated twisted polytope sheaf, hence mirrors the action of $\mathcal{O}(D)$ on coherent sheaves."

2505.04988,Semi-Explicit Solution of Some Discrete-Time Mean-Field-Type Games with Higher-Order Costs,"['math.OC', 'eess.SY']","['Julian Barreiro-Gomez', 'Tyrone E. Duncan', 'Bozenna Pasik-Duncan', 'Hamidou Tembine']","Traditional solvable game theory and mean-field-type game theory (risk-aware games) predominantly focus on quadratic costs due to their analytical tractability. Nevertheless, they often fail to capture critical non-linearities inherent in real-world systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for solving discrete-time game problems with higher-order state and strategy costs involving power-law terms. We derive semi-explicit expressions for equilibrium strategies, cost-to-go functions, and recursive coefficient dynamics across deterministic, stochastic, and multi-agent system settings by convex-completion techniques. The contributions include variance-aware solutions under additive and multiplicative noise, extensions to mean-field-type-dependent dynamics, and conditions that ensure the positivity of recursive coefficients. Our results provide a foundational methodology for analyzing non linear multi-agent systems under higher-order penalization, bridging classical game theory and mean-field-type game theory with modern computational tools for engineering applications."
2505.04987,Intrinsic characterization of projective special complex manifolds,['math.DG'],"['Vicente Cortés', 'Kazuyuki Hasegawa']","We define the notion of an $S^1$-bundle of projective special complex base type and construct a conical special complex manifold from it. Consequently the base space of such an $S^{1}$-bundle can be realized as $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$-quotient of a conical special complex manifold. As a corollary, we give an intrinsic characterization of a projective special complex manifold generalizing Mantegazza's characterization of a projective special Kähler manifold. Our characterization is in the language of c-projective structures. As an application, a non-trivial $S^1$-family of Obata-Ricci-flat hypercomplex structures (given by a generalization of the rigid c-map) on the tangent bundle of the total space of a $\mathbb{C}^*$-bundle over a complex manifold with certain kind of c-projective structure is constructed. Finally, we show that the quaternionic structure underlying any of these hypercomplex structures is in general not flat and that its flatness implies the vanishing of the c-projective Weyl tensor of the base of the $\mathbb{C}^*$-bundle. Conversely, any c-projectively flat complex manifold satisfying a cohomological integrality condition gives rise to a flat quaternionic structure."

If the socle of $G$ is a finite exceptional simple group, then we prove that $\mathcal{D}$ is isomorphic to one of two infinite families of $2$-designs with point-primitive automorphism groups, one is the Suzuki-Tits ovoid design with parameter set $(v,b,r,k,λ)=(q^{2}+1,q^{2}(q^{2}+1)/(q-1),q^{2},q,q-1)$ design, where $q-1$ is a Mersenne prime, and the other is newly constructed in this paper and has parameter set $(v,b,r,k,λ)=(q^{3}(q^{3}-1)/2,(q+1)(q^{6}-1),(q+1)(q^{3}+1),q^{3}/2,q+1)$, where $q+1$ a Fermat prime.

We consider scattering geodesics in $\mathcal{M}$, first introduced by Victor Guillemin in \cite{Guillemin1976-xr} for hyperbolic surfaces with cusps. These are geodesics in $\mathcal{M}$ that lie in $\mathcal{M} \setminus \Mm$ for both large positive and negative times. Associated with such a scattering geodesic in $\mathcal{M}$, a finite \textit{sojourn time} is defined in \cite{Guillemin1976-xr}. In this article, we study the distribution of these scattering geodesics in $\mathcal{M}$ and their associated \textit{sojourn times}. In this process, we establish a connection between the counting of scattering geodesics on the modular surface and the study of positive integers whose prime divisors lie in arithmetic progression. This article is the first such result for scattering geodesics."
2505.04957,The Poisson tensor completion non-parametric differential entropy estimator,"['math.ST', 'stat.ME']","['Daniel M. Dunlavy', 'Richard B. Lehoucq', 'Carolyn D. Mayer', 'Arvind Prasadan']","We introduce the Poisson tensor completion (PTC) estimator, a non-parametric differential entropy estimator. The PTC estimator leverages inter-sample relationships to compute a low-rank Poisson tensor decomposition of the frequency histogram. Our crucial observation is that the histogram bins are an instance of a space partitioning of counts and thus can be identified with a spatial Poisson process. The Poisson tensor decomposition leads to a completion of the intensity measure over all bins -- including those containing few to no samples -- and leads to our proposed PTC differential entropy estimator. A Poisson tensor decomposition models the underlying distribution of the count data and guarantees non-negative estimated values and so can be safely used directly in entropy estimation. Our estimator is the first tensor-based estimator that exploits the underlying spatial Poisson process related to the histogram explicitly when estimating the probability density with low-rank tensor decompositions for the purpose of tensor completion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our PTC estimator is a substantial improvement over standard histogram-based estimators for sub-Gaussian probability distributions because of the concentration of norm phenomenon."
2505.04951,On the arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes,['math.NT'],['Matt Visser'],"The arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes, $\bar p_n = {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, exhibits very many interesting and subtle properties. Since the transformation from $p_n \to \bar p_n$ is extremely easy to invert, $p_n = n\bar p_n - (n-1)\bar p_{n-1}$, it is clear that these two sequences $p_n \longleftrightarrow \bar p_n$ must ultimately carry exactly the same information. But the averaged sequence $\bar p_n$, while very closely correlated with the primes, ($\bar p_n \sim {1\over2} p_n$), is much ""smoother'', and much better behaved. Using extensions of various standard results I shall demonstrate that the prime-averaged sequence $\bar p_n$ satisfies prime-averaged analogues of the Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann, Brocard, Fourges, Firoozbakht, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these prime-averaged analogues are not conjectures, they are theorems.) The crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the ""smoothing'' process inherent in averaging. Whereas the asymptotic behaviour of the two sequences is very closely correlated the local fluctuations are quite different."

In particular, if $θ$ is of bounded type, then the Julia set of the sine function $S_θ(z)=e^{2πiθ}\sin(z)$ is locally connected.

2505.04942,Randomized Routing to Remote Queues,"['math.PR', 'math.OC']","['Shuangchi He', 'Yunfang Yang', 'Yao Yu']","We study load balancing for a queueing system where parallel stations are distant from customers. In the presence of traveling delays, the join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) policy induces queue length oscillations and prolongs the mean waiting time. A variant of the JSQ policy, dubbed the randomized join-the-shortest-queue (RJSQ) policy, is devised to mitigate the oscillation phenomenon. By the RJSQ policy, customers are sent to each station with a probability approximately proportional to its service capacity; only a small fraction of customers are purposely routed to the shortest queue. The additional probability of routing a customer to the shortest queue, referred to as the balancing fraction, dictates the policy's performance. When the balancing fraction is within a certain range, load imbalance between the stations is negligible in heavy traffic, so that complete resource pooling is achieved. We specify the optimal order of magnitude for the balancing fraction, by which heuristic formulas are proposed to fine-tune the RJSQ policy. A joint problem of capacity planning and load balancing is considered for geographically separated stations. With well planned service capacities, the RJSQ policy sends all but a small fraction of customers to the nearest stations, rendering the system asymptotically equivalent to an aggregated single-server system with all customers having minimum traveling delays. If each customer's service requirement does not depend on the station, the RJSQ policy is asymptotically optimal for reducing workload."

  For a graph parameter $p$, let $p(k,G) = \max \{ \sum_{i=1}^k p(Gi) \}$, taken over all $k$-decompositions of graph $G$.

  Among the many results obtained in this paper we mention the following selected ones.
  (1) $M(k, n) < \sqrt{k} n$, and $\lim_{k\to\infty} ( \liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{M(k,n)}{\sqrt{k}\,n} ) = 1$.

The main difficulty in numerical analysis lies in the non-positivity of the kernel and its coupling with the complementary discrete convolution kernel (such that different model exponents are also coupled), and the results extend those in [Chen, Thomée and Wahlbin, Math. Comp. 1992] to the subdiffusive case. Numerical experiments are performed to substantiate the theoretical results."

The smallest order of such an induced subgraph $G[S]$ of $G$ which admits a $k$- Sudoku coloring is called $k$- Sudoku number of $G$ and is denoted by $sn(G,k)$. When $k=χ(G)$, we call $k$- Sudoku number of $G$ as Sudoku number of $G$ and is denoted by $sn(G)$.

These so-called stable transfer operators are intended to serve as the main local ingredient in Beyond Endoscopy, his proposed strategy for proving the Principle of Functoriality. Working over a local field of characteristic zero and assuming a hypothesis on the local Langlands correspondence for p-adic groups, we prove the existence of continuous stable transfer operators between spaces of stable orbital integrals of Harish-Chandra Schwartz functions, test functions, and K-finite test functions. This is achieved via stable Paley--Wiener theorems for each of the three types of function spaces. The stable Paley--Wiener theorem for Harish-Chandra Schwartz functions is new and includes the result that stable tempered characters span a weak-* dense subspace of the space of stable tempered distributions, a result previously unknown for p-adic groups."

To overcome the difficulties posed by the interplay between the nonlinearities and the stochastic forcing, we adopt a `truncate-then-discretise' strategy: the nonlinear term is first truncated before discretising the resulting modified problem. We show that the strong solution to the truncated problem converges in probability to that of the original problem. A fully discrete numerical scheme is then proposed for the truncated system, and we establish both convergence in probability and strong convergence (with quantitative rates) for the two fields used in the mixed formulation."

The limiting distribution of the scaled spectral radius and the scaled minimum modulus for the complex induced Ginibre ensemble, with a proportional rectangularity index, is the Gumbel distribution. The independence of these extrema is established, at appropriate scaling, for large matrices from the complex Ginibre ensemble as well as from the complex induced Ginibre ensemble for either fixed or proportional rectangularity indexes. The joint distribution of the eigenvalue moduli for the complex Ginibre ensemble is derived in this paper. It is equal to the joint distribution of independent random variables, each following a Gamma-Rayleigh distribution. In the limit of a large size of the complex Ginibre matrices, the left and right tail distributions of the minimum modulus are the Rayleigh and Weibull distributions, respectively. The limiting left tail distribution of minimum modulus is the same for these non-Hermitian ensembles when the rectangularity index of the complex induced Ginibre ensemble is equal to zero. This phenomenon is also verified for the right tail distribution of this minimum."

We propose a novel method based on the k-means clustering method to address the challenges when the chaotic attractor exhibits two-fold rotation symmetry. This method is demonstrated to recover the symmetry of the latent chaotic attractor and discover the correct causality between time series without introducing information from other variables.

  Inexact versions of the Newton step and negative curvature are
  proposed in order to reduce the cost of evaluating second-order information.
  Details are given of such an iterative implementation using Krylov subspaces.
  An extended algorithm for finding second-order

For such random fractals we consider mean values of the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures of their parallel sets for small parallel radii. Under the uniform strong open set condition and some further geometric assumptions we show that rescaled limits of these mean values exist as the parallel radius tends to 0. Moreover, integral representations are derived for these limits which recover and extend those known in the deterministic case and certain random cases. Results on the mean Minkowski content are included as a special case and shown to hold under weaker geometric assumptions."

Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs."

While the elementary differential geometry of Riemannian statistical manifolds is well-known, their conformal geometry remains entirely unexplored. In this article, we begin this programme of exploration by determining some invariants of the conformal structure of the Fisher-Rao metric. Specifically, we study the holonomy of a conformally-invariant connection on the standard tractor bundle of the bivariate Gaussian manifold. It is found that for a generic pair of random variables, the conformal holonomy group is the identity-connected component of the indefinite special orthogonal group, $SO^{0}(1,6)$. Remarkably, however, when the random variables are statistically independent, the conformal holonomy representation is reducible and the conformal holonomy group is $SO^{0}(1,4)$."

2505.04777,On the Klein and Williams Conjecture for the Equivariant Fixed Point Problem,['math.AT'],['Başak Küçük'],"Klein and Williams developed an obstruction theory for the homotopical equivariant fixed point problem, which asks whether an equivariant map can be deformed, through an equivariant homotopy, into another map with no fixed points \cite[Theorem H]{KW2}. An alternative approach to this problem was given by Fadell and Wong \cite{FW88} using a collection of Nielsen numbers. It remained an open question, stated as a conjecture in \cite{KW2}, whether these Nielsen numbers could be computed from the Klein-Williams invariant. We resolve this conjecture by providing an explicit decomposition of the Klein-Williams invariant under the tom Dieck splitting. Furthermore, we apply these results to the periodic point problem."

2505.04760,Isotropic Torsors on Smooth Algebras over Prüfer Rings,['math.AG'],['Arnab Kundu'],"The Grothendieck--Serre conjecture predicts that every generically trivial torsor under a reductive group over a regular semilocal ring is itself trivial. Extending the work of Česnavičius and Fedorov, we prove a non-noetherian analogue of this conjecture for rings $A$ that are semilocalisations of smooth schemes over valuation rings of rank one, and for reductive $A$-group schemes $G$ that are totally isotropic. Roughly speaking, such group schemes are characterised by the existence of a parabolic subgroup of their adjoint quotients. Since quasi-split groups are totally isotropic, our result, in particular, generalises the Grothendieck--Serre result of Guo--Liu and the author's thesis. Our proof relies on a new instance of Gabber's presentation lemma, obtained by extending techniques developed in the author's thesis."
2505.04749,Abstract isomorphisms of isotropic root graded groups over rings,['math.GR'],['Pavel Gvozdevsky'],"The celebrated Borel--Tits theorem provides a classification of abstract isomorphisms between (simple) isotropic groups over fields, showing that such isomorphisms arise from field isomorphisms and group-scheme isomorphisms. In this work, we extend the scope of this classification to certain class of group schemes over arbitrary commutative rings. Specifically, we prove that under suitable conditions abstract isomorphisms between the groups of points of isotropic, absolutely simple, adjoint group schemes over rings admit a description analogous to that in the classical setting: namely, they are induced by isomorphisms of ground rings and isomorphisms of the underlying group schemes. This result generalizes the classical theory to a far broader algebraic context and confirms that the rigidity phenomena observed over fields persist over rings."

We establish key properties of the associated uncertainty product, showing that it is invariant under scale and translation transformations. Notably, we prove that the infimum of the uncertainty within the asymmetric class is attained in the even subclass. Within two specific wavelet dictionaries, we identify the tent function as the unique minimiser of the time-frequency uncertainty, achieving a value of $U = \frac{3}{10}$. Additionally, we analyse the family of $p$-fold self-convolutions of the rectangle function, $\operatorname{rect}^{\{p\}}$, demonstrating that the uncertainty decreases monotonically towards the Heisenberg bound $ \frac{1}{4} $ as $p \to \infty$. These findings unify and explain various empirical observations from the literature on adaptive wavelet design and Gabor frame stability, and suggest a principled approach to constructing dictionaries with provably optimal joint localisation properties."

Building on foundational notions such as second modules and coprime modules, we introduce new submodule products and characterize coprime modules using these products. The study extends classical definitions by defining \textbf{$\mathscr{A}$-co-first modules} and \textbf{$\mathscr{A}$-fully co-first modules}, which utilize subclasses of preradicals to broaden the scope of coprimeness. Additionally, we investigate the lattice structure of conatural classes and their closure properties, providing conditions under which co-first modules coincide with second modules. The paper also examines the implications of these concepts in the context of left MAX rings and left perfect rings, offering a comparative analysis of coprimeness and secondness. Our results try to contribute to a deeper understanding of module theory and its applications, while highlighting connections between preradicals, module classes, and ring properties."

2505.04721,Sparse Regularized Optimal Transport without Curse of Dimensionality,"['math.ST', 'math.PR']","['Alberto González-Sanz', 'Stephan Eckstein', 'Marcel Nutz']","Entropic optimal transport -- the optimal transport problem regularized by KL diver\-gence -- is highly successful in statistical applications. Thanks to the smoothness of the entropic coupling, its sample complexity avoids the curse of dimensionality suffered by unregularized optimal transport. The flip side of smoothness is overspreading: the entropic coupling always has full support, whereas the unregularized coupling that it approximates is usually sparse, even given by a map. Regularizing optimal transport by less-smooth $f$-divergences such as Tsallis divergence (i.e., $L^p$-regularization) is known to allow for sparse approximations, but is often thought to suffer from the curse of dimensionality as the couplings have limited differentiability and the dual is not strongly concave. We refute this conventional wisdom and show, for a broad family of divergences, that the key empirical quantities converge at the parametric rate, independently of the dimension. More precisely, we provide central limit theorems for the optimal cost, the optimal coupling, and the dual potentials induced by i.i.d.\ samples from the marginals. These results are obtained by a powerful yet elementary approach that is of broader interest for Z-estimation in function classes that are not Donsker."
2505.04661,Compact Group Actions with the Tracial Rokhlin Property II: Examples and Nonexistence Theorems,['math.OA'],"['Javad Mohammadkarimi', 'N. Christopher Phillips']","In a previous paper, we introduced the restricted tracial Rokhlin property with comparison, a ``tracial'' analog of the Rokhlin property for actions of second countable compact groups on infinite dimensional simple separable unital C*-algebras. In this paper, we give three classes of examples of actions of compact groups which have this property but do not have the Rokhlin property, or even finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers. One class consists of infinite tensor products of finite group actions with the tracial Rokhlin property, giving actions of the product of the groups involved. The second class consists of actions of the circle group on simple unital AT~algebras. The construction of the third class starts with an action of the circle on the Cuntz algebra ${\mathcal{O}}_{\infty}$ which has the restricted tracial Rokhlin property with comparison; by contrast, it is known that there is no action of this group on ${\mathcal{O}}_{\infty}$ which has finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers. We can then tensor this action with the trivial action on any unital purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebra. One also gets such actions on certain purely infinite simple separable nuclear C*-algebras by tensoring the AT~examples with the trivial action on ${\mathcal{O}}_{\infty}$; these are different.
  We also discuss other tracial Rokhlin properties for actions of compact groups, and prove that there is no direct limit action of the circle group on a simple AF~algebra which even has the weakest of these properties."
2505.04596,Dynamic Network Flow Optimization for Task Scheduling in PTZ Camera Surveillance Systems,"['math.OC', 'cs.CV', 'eess.SY']","['Mohammad Merati', 'David Castañón']","This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the scheduling and control of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras in dynamic surveillance environments. The proposed method integrates Kalman filters for motion prediction with a dynamic network flow model to enhance real-time video capture efficiency. By assigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future locations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven approach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and adaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant monitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects to be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a value-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the timely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values over time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent deadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves coverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to traditional master-slave camera systems. Overall, our method significantly enhances the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of surveillance systems, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments."

The Chow ring of the latter admits a simple, combinatorial description, which we compute by patching along a natural stratification by core level.

The physical problem involves determining the optimal distribution, given by $h\colon Γ_I\to [0,+\infty)$, of a given amount $m\in \mathbb{N}$ of insulating material attached to a boundary part $Γ_I\subseteq \partialΩ$ of a thermally conducting body $Ω\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \in \mathbb{N}$, subject to conductive heat transfer. To tackle the non-local and non-smooth character of the problem, the article introduces a (Fenchel) duality framework: (a) At the continuous level, using (Fenchel) duality relations, we derive an a posteriori error identity that can handle arbitrary admissible approximations of the primal and dual formulations of the convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problem; (b) At the discrete level, using discrete (Fenchel) duality relations, we derive an a priori error identity that applies to a Crouzeix--Raviart discretization of the primal formulation and a Raviart--Thomas discretization of the dual formulation. The proposed framework leads to error decay rates that are optimal with respect to the specific regularity of a minimizer. In addition, we prove convergence of the numerical approximation under minimal regularity assumptions. Since the discrete dual formulation can be written as a quadratic program, it is solved using a primal-dual active set strategy interpreted as semismooth Newton method. A solution of the discrete primal formulation is reconstructed from the solution of the discrete dual formulation by means of an inverse generalized Marini formula. This is the first such formula for this class of convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problems."

We prove that the problem of counting tame $ SL_k $-frieze patterns can be reduced to counting these sets if $ \gcd(k,n) = 1 $. Otherwise, certain subsets $ C_k^*(n) $ need to be considered instead. Afterwards we count $ C_k(n)$ in the cases $ k = 3 $ and $ k = 4 $ and $ C_3^*(n) $, leading to our results."

Let $χ_{\rm pcf}^h(G)$ denote the minimum $k$ such that such a colouring exists. We show that for every fixed $h\ge 1$, every graph $G$ of maximum degree $Δ$ satisfies $χ_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le hΔ+ \mathcal{O}(\log Δ)$. This expands on the work of Cho et al., and improves a recent result of Liu and Reed in the case $h=1$. We conjecture that for every $h\ge 1$ and every graph $G$ of maximum degree $Δ$ sufficiently large, the bound $χ_{\rm pcf}^h(G) \le hΔ+ 1$ should hold, which would be tight. When the minimum degree $δ$ of $G$ is sufficiently large, namely $δ\ge \max\{100h, 3000\log Δ\}$, we show that this upper bound can be further reduced to $χ_{\rm{pcf}}^h(G) \le Δ+ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{hΔ})$.

More precisely, the flow map fails to be $C^{2k+1}$-continuous in any Sobolev space $H^s$ below that threshold, and the threshold is independent of the power nonlinearity. This novel behavior significantly differs from other compact spaces such as the torus or the sphere, and it is directly connected to the existence of localized eigenfunctions."

Motivated by the challenge of designing algorithms that leverage off-policy data while maintaining on-policy exploration, we propose PGDA-RL, a novel primal-dual Projected Gradient Descent-Ascent algorithm for solving regularized Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). PGDA-RL integrates experience replay-based gradient estimation with a two-timescale decomposition of the underlying nested optimization problem. The algorithm operates asynchronously, interacts with the environment through a single trajectory of correlated data, and updates its policy online in response to the dual variable associated with the occupation measure of the underlying MDP. We prove that PGDA-RL converges almost surely to the optimal value function and policy of the regularized MDP. Our convergence analysis relies on tools from stochastic approximation theory and holds under weaker assumptions than those required by existing primal-dual RL approaches, notably removing the need for a simulator or a fixed behavioral policy."

The class of functions in question arises in the early work of R. G. Douglas and V. I. Paulsen on the rational dilation of a Hilbert space operator $T$ to a normal operator with spectrum in $\partial R_δ$. Their work suggested the following norm $\|\cdot\|_{\mathrm{dp}}$ on the space $\mathrm{Hol}(R_δ)$ of holomorphic functions on $R_δ$, \[ \|φ\|_{\mathrm{dp}} \stackrel{\rm def}{=} \sup\{ \|φ(T)\|: \|T\|\leq 1, \|T^{-1} \|\leq 1/δ\ \text{and} \ σ(T)\subseteq R_δ\}.\] By analogy with the classical Schur class of holomorphic functions $\mathcal{S} $ with supremum norm at most $1$ on the disc $\mathbb{D}$, it is natural to consider the dp-Schur class $\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{dp}$ of holomorphic functions of dp-norm at most $1$ on $R_δ$.
  Our central result is a Pick interpolation theorem for functions in $\mathcal{S}_\mathrm{dp}$ that is analogous to Abrahamse's Interpolation Theorem for bounded holomorphic functions on a multiply-connected domain. For a tuple $λ=(λ_1,\dots,λ_n)$ of distinct interpolation nodes in $R_δ$, we introduce a special set $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm {dp}}(λ)$ of positive definite $n\times n$ matrices, which we call DP Szegő kernels. The DP Pick problem $λ_j \mapsto z_j, j=1,\dots,n$, is shown to be solvable if and only if, \[ [(1-\bar z_i z_j)g_{ij}] \ge 0 \; \text{ for all}\; g \in \mathcal{G}_{\mathrm {dp}} (λ).\] We prove further that a solvable DP Pick problem has a solution which is a rational function."

The associated deterministic system for $\varepsilon=0$ has a potential that is not a Lipschitz function at the origin. Therefore, an infinite number of solutions exist, known as the Peano phenomenon. In this work, we study large deviations of first and second order for the system with noise, generalizing previous results for the particular potential $b(x)=x |x|^{γ-1}$. For the first-order large deviations, we recover the rate function from the well-known Freidlin-Wentzell work. For the second-order large deviation, we use a refinement of Carmona-Simon bounds for the eigenfunctions of a Schrödinger operator and prove that the exponential behavior of the process depends only on the ground state of such an operator. Moreover, a refined study of the ground state allows us to obtain the large deviation rate function explicitly and to deduce that the family of diffusions converges to the set of extreme solutions of the deterministic system."

We show that global--in--time dissipative solutions always exist as long as the rigid bodies are connected compact sets. In addition, in the absence of external driving forces, the system always tends to a static equilibrium as time goes to infinity. The results hold independently of possible collisions of rigid bodies and for any finite energy initial data."

  Moreover, we prove convergence of the proposed algorithm (under suitable technical assumptions) and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. We also demonstrate the performance of the method on several examples with various degrees of regularity and degeneracy and compare the results to two existing methods. Our method runs considerably faster than the ones used for comparison, improving the running time by a factor of 3--10 for smooth, strictly convex examples, and by a factor of 20--100 or more for mildly degenerate examples."

We contend that an evolutionary agentic workflow, powered by foundation models and evolutionary search, can autonomously navigate the optimization space, comprising problem, formulation, algorithm, and hyperparameter spaces. Through case studies in cloud resource scheduling and ADMM parameter adaptation, we demonstrate how this approach can bridge the gap between academic innovation and industrial implementation. Our position challenges the status quo of human-centric optimization workflows and advocates for a more scalable, adaptive approach to solving real-world optimization problems."

We consider the optimization problem in the framework of a linear elasticity model. We choose three mechanical measures that define optimality via related objective functionals: the compliance, the \(L^p\)-norm of the von Mises stress, and the area of the stretched skin. We provide a proof of the existence of solutions for each problem, but we cannot claim uniqueness. We compute the gradient of the objectives with respect to the cut configuration using shape calculus concepts. To solve the problem numerically, we use the gradient descent method, which performs well under uniaxial stretching. However, in more complex cases, such as multidirectional stretching, its effectiveness is limited due to low sensitivity of the functionals. To avoid this difficulty, we use a combination of the genetic algorithm and the gradient descent method, which leads to a significant improvement in the results."

They can also be considered as generalized splines over modules.
  The main goal of this paper is to study the $R$-module structure of extending generalized splines. We concentrate on two following questions: which of the results for general splines extend to generalized splines over modules and if there is an algorithm or an explicit formula for special basis classes, called a flow up basis, for generalized splines over modules. We show that certain results concerning generalized splines can be extended to a setting where each vertex $v$ is assigned a module $M_v=m_v\mathbb Z$. We provide an algorithm to construct a special basis for generalized splines over these modules on paths. Additionally, we introduce a new technique to construct a flow-up basis on arbitrary graphs using the idea of an algorithm on paths."
2505.04341,PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for fully connected deep neural network with Gaussian priors,"['math.ST', 'stat.ML']",['The Tien Mai'],"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a powerful methodology with significant practical successes in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. Recent works have demonstrated that sparsely connected DNNs with carefully designed architectures can achieve minimax estimation rates under classical smoothness assumptions. However, subsequent studies revealed that simple fully connected DNNs can achieve comparable convergence rates, challenging the necessity of sparsity. Theoretical advances in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have been more fragmented. Much of those work has concentrated on sparse networks, leaving the theoretical properties of fully connected BNNs underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating fully connected Bayesian DNNs with Gaussian prior using PAC-Bayes bounds. We establish upper bounds on the prediction risk for a probabilistic deep neural network method, showing that these bounds match (up to logarithmic factors) the minimax-optimal rates in Besov space, for both nonparametric regression and binary classification with logistic loss. Importantly, our results hold for a broad class of practical activation functions that are Lipschitz continuous."

Since they are commonly used to model economic and financial evolutions, the calibration and optimal control of such processes are of interest to many communities and have been the subject of extensive research. In this work, we develop an optimization method working at the microscopic level. This allows us also to reduce computational time since we can parallelize the calculations and do not encounter the so-called curse of dimensionality that occurs when lifting the problem to its macroscopic counterpart using partial differential equations (PDEs). Using a discretize-then-optimize approach, we derive an adjoint process and an optimality system in the Lagrange framework. Then, we apply Monte Carlo methods to solve all the arising equations. We validate our optimization strategy by extensive numerical experiments. We also successfully test a optimization procedure that avoids storing the information of the forward equation."

2505.04312,Beyond entropic regularization: Debiased Gaussian estimators for discrete optimal transport and general linear programs,['math.ST'],"['Shuyu Liu', 'Florentina Bunea', 'Jonathan Niles-Weed']","This work proposes new estimators for discrete optimal transport plans that enjoy Gaussian limits centered at the true solution. This behavior stands in stark contrast with the performance of existing estimators, including those based on entropic regularization, which are asymptotically biased and only satisfy a CLT centered at a regularized version of the population-level plan. We develop a new regularization approach based on a different class of penalty functions, which can be viewed as the duals of those previously considered in the literature. The key feature of these penalty schemes it that they give rise to preliminary estimates that are asymptotically linear in the penalization strength. Our final estimator is obtained by constructing an appropriate linear combination of two penalized solutions corresponding to two different tuning parameters so that the bias introduced by the penalization cancels out. Unlike classical debiasing procedures, therefore, our proposal entirely avoids the delicate problem of estimating and then subtracting the estimated bias term. Our proofs, which apply beyond the case of optimal transport, are based on a novel asymptotic analysis of penalization schemes for linear programs. As a corollary of our results, we obtain the consistency of the naive bootstrap for fully data-driven inference on the true optimal solution. Simulation results and two data analyses support strongly the benefits of our approach relative to existing techniques."

We show that the $n$-valued multiplication in the group $\mathbb{G}_n$ is realized in terms of the eigenvalues of the Kronecker sum of companion Frobenius matrices for polynomials of the form $t^n - x$ in the variable $t$. The notion of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix is introduced. When $x = (-1)^n$, $y = z = 1$, one recovers the classical Wendt matrix, whose determinant is used in number theory in connection with Fermat's Last Theorem. It is shown that for each positive integer $n$, the polynomial $p_n$ is given by the determinant of a Wendt $(x, y, z)$-matrix. Iterations of the $n$-valued multiplication in the group $\mathbb{G}_n$ lead to polynomials $p_n(z; x_1, \dots, x_m)$. We prove the irreducibility of the polynomial $p_n(z; x_1, \dots, x_m)$ over various fields. For each $n$, we introduce the notion of classes of symmetric $n$-algebraic $n$-valued groups. The group $\mathbb{G}_n$ belongs to one of these classes. For $n = 2, 3$, a description of the universal objects of these classes is obtained."

2505.04289,Micro-macro population dynamics models of benthic algae with long-memory decay and generic growth,['math.PR'],"['Hidekazu Yoshioka', 'Kunihiko Hamagami']","Benthic algae, as a primary producer in riverine ecosystems, develop biofilms on the riverbed. Their population dynamics involve growth and decay processes, the former owing to the balance between biological proliferation and mortality, while the latter results from mechanical abrasion because of the transport of sediment particles, such as sand and gravel. The decay has experimentally been identified to exhibit long memory behavior, where the population decreases at an algebraic rate. However, the origin and mathematical theory of this phenomenon remain unresolved. This study introduces a novel mathematical model employing spin processes to describe microscopic biofilm dynamics. The continuum limit of these spin processes captures the long-memory decay and generates generic growth curves. A spin process is defined as a continuous-time stochastic process transitioning between states 0 and 1. The proposed framework leverages heterogeneous spin rates, achieved by superposing spin processes with distinct rates, to reproduce the long-memory decay. Computational simulations demonstrate the behavior of the model, particularly emphasizing rate-induced tipping phenomena. This mathematical model provides a computationally tractable interpretation of benthic algae dynamics, relevant to applications in mathematical modelling."

Hybrid unknowns corresponding to transmission variables are introduced at the element interfaces and the physical unknowns inside the elements are eliminated, resulting in a hybridized system with favorable properties for fast iterative solution. In this paper, we extend the CHDG method, initially studied for the Helmholtz equation, to the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. We prove that the local problems stemming from hybridization are well-posed and that the fixed-point iteration naturally associated to the hybridized system is contractive. We propose a 3D implementation with a discrete scheme based on nodal basis functions. The resulting solver and different iterative strategies are studied with several numerical examples using a high-performance parallel C++ code."

  We find that the Bargmann transform is a unitary operator from $H$ to a weighted Fock space. After identifying the reproducing kernel of $H$, we discover an unexpected phenomenon about the decay of the eigenvalues of a two-sided concentration operator, namely that the plunge region is of the same order of magnitude as the region where the eigenvalues are close to 1, contrasting the classical case of Paley--Wiener spaces."

In this paper, we study several questions from Erdős's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{Ω(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.

When disruptions occur, the flight schedule needs to be adjusted such that the operation can continue. Since this happens during the day of operations, this needs to be done as close to real time as possible, posing a challenge with respect to computation time. Moreover, to limit the impact of disruptions, we want a solution with minimal cost and passenger impact. Since airline operations include many interlinked decisions, an integrated approach leads to better overall solutions. We specifically look at resolving these disruptions in both the aircraft and crew schedules. Resolving these disruptions is complex, especially when it is done in an integrated way, i.e. including multiple different resources.
  To solve this problem in an integrated manner, we developed a fast simulated annealing approach. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a local search approach to resolve airline disruptions in an integrated way. This approach is compared with traditional approaches, and an experimental study is done to evaluate different neighbour generation methods, and to investigate different recovery scenarios and strategies. The comparison is done using real world data from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Here, we show that our approach resolves disruptions quickly and in a cost-efficient manner, and that it outperforms traditional approaches. Compared to naive delay propagation, our method saves 40% in non-performance costs. Moreover, while most airlines use tools that consider resources separately, our approach shows that integrated disruption management is possible within 30 seconds."
2505.04271,Order reduction of $Λ$-marked monomial ideals and weak resolutions,['math.AG'],['Kai Machida'],"Borger's theory of $Λ$-spaces imbues algebraic spaces, which include schemes, with an additional structure defined by an extension of the Witt vector functor. Motivated by $\mathbb{F}_1$-geometry, we prove the existence of a weak resolution of singularities in the category of $Λ$-schemes. Our arguments are based on standard arguments in characteristic $0$ using the order reduction of an ideal marked with $Λ$-equivariant data. This paper is based on work from the author's PhD thesis."
2505.04267,Lattice tilings of Hilbert spaces,['math.FA'],"['Carlo Alberto De Bernardi', 'Tommaso Russo', 'Jacopo Somaglia']","We construct a bounded and symmetric convex body in $\ell_2(Γ)$ (for certain cardinals $Γ$) whose translates yield a tiling of $\ell_2(Γ)$. This answers a question due to Fonf and Lindenstrauss. As a consequence, we obtain the first example of an infinite-dimensional reflexive Banach space that admits a tiling with balls (of radius $1$). Further, our tiling has the property of being point-countable and lattice (in the sense that the set of translates forms a group). The same construction performed in $\ell_1(Γ)$ yields a point-$2$-finite lattice tiling by balls of radius $1$ for $\ell_1(Γ)$, which compares to a celebrated construction due to Klee. We also prove that lattice tilings by balls are never disjoint and, more generally, each tile intersects as many tiles as the cardinality of the tiling. Finally, we prove some results concerning discrete subgroups of normed spaces. By a simplification of the proof of our main result, we prove that every infinite-dimensional normed space contains a subgroup that is $1$-separated and $(1+\varepsilon)$-dense, for every $\varepsilon>0$; further, the subgroup admits a set of generators of norm at most $2+\varepsilon$. This solves a problem due to Swanepoel and yields a simpler proof of a result of Dilworth, Odell, Schlumprecht, and Zsák. We also give an alternative elementary proof of Steprāns' result that discrete subgroups of normed spaces are free."
2505.04252,Space-Time-Dependent Source Identification Problem for a Subdiffusion Equation,['math.AP'],"['R. R. Ashurov', 'O. T. Mukhiddinova']","In this paper, we investigate the inverse problem of determining the right-hand side of a subdiffusion equation with a Caputo time derivative, where the right-hand side depends on both time and certain spatial variables. Similar inverse problems have been previously explored for hyperbolic and parabolic equations, with some studies establishing the existence and uniqueness of generalized solutions, while others proved the uniqueness of classical solutions. However, such inverse problems for fractional-order equations have not been addressed prior to this work. Here, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution to the considered inverse problem. To solve it, we employ the Fourier method with respect to the variable independent of the unknown right-hand side, followed by the method of successive approximations to compute the Fourier coefficients of the solution. Notably, the results obtained are also novel for parabolic equations."

We establish the existence of an action ground state when the size of the loop is either very small or very large. Our analysis relies on variational arguments, such as profile decomposition. When it exists, we study the shape of the ground state using ordinary differential equations arguments, such as the study of period functions. The theoretical results are completed with a numerical study."

We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a generalization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals. Finally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both multi-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs."
2505.04247,A block preconditioner for thermo-poromechanics with frictional deformation of fractures,['math.NA'],"['Yury Zabegaev', 'Inga Berre', 'Eirik Keilegavlen']","The numerical modeling of fracture contact thermo-poromechanics is crucial for advancing subsurface engineering applications, including CO2 sequestration, production of geo-energy resources, energy storage and wastewater disposal operations. Accurately modeling this problem presents substantial challenges due to the complex physics involved in strongly coupled thermo-poromechanical processes and the frictional contact mechanics of fractures. To resolve process couplings in the resulting mathematical model, it is common to apply fully implicit time stepping. This necessitates the use of an iterative linear solver to run the model. The solver's efficiency primarily depends on a robust preconditioner, which is particularly challenging to develop because it must handle the mutual couplings between linearized contact mechanics and energy, momentum, and mass balance. In this work, we introduce a preconditioner for the problem based on the nested approximations of Schur complements. To decouple the momentum balance, we utilize the fixed-stress approximation, extended to account for both the porous media and fracture subdomains. The singularity of the contact mechanics submatrix is resolved by a linear transformation. Two variations of the algorithm are proposed to address the coupled mass and energy balance submatrix: either the Constrained Pressure Residual or the System-AMG approach. The preconditioner is evaluated through numerical experiments of fluid injection into fractured porous media, which causes thermal contraction and subsequent sliding and opening of fractures. The experiments show that the preconditioner performs robustly for a wide range of simulation regimes governed by various fracture states, friction coefficients and Peclet number. The grid refinement experiments demonstrate that the preconditioner scales well in terms of GMRES iterations, in both two and three dimensions."
2505.04227,Modeling of thin plate flexural vibrations by Partition of Unity Finite Element Method,['math.NA'],"['Tong Zhou', 'Jean-Daniel Chazot', 'Emmanuel Perrey-Debain', 'Li Cheng']","This paper presents a conforming thin plate bending element based on the Partition of Unity Finite Element Method (PUFEM), for the simulation of steady-state forced vibration. The issue of ensuring the continuity of displacement and slope between elements is addressed by the use of cubic Hermite-type Partition of Unity (PU) functions. With appropriate PU functions, the PUFEM allows the incorporation of the special enrichment functions into the finite elements to better cope with plate oscillations in a broad frequency band. The enrichment strategies consist of the sum of a power series up to a given order and a combination of progressive flexural wave solutions with polynomials. The applicability and the effectiveness of the PUFEM plate elements is first verified via the structural frequency response. Investigation is then carried out to analyze the role of polynomial enrichment orders and enriched plane wave distributions for achieving good computational performance in terms of accuracy and data reduction. Numerical results show that the PUFEM with high-order polynomials and hybrid wave-polynomial combinations can provide highly accurate prediction results by using reduced degrees of freedom and improved rate of convergence, as compared with the classical FEM."
2505.04225,Complete monotonicity of log-functions,"['math.CA', 'hep-th', 'math-ph']","['Rourou Ma', 'Julian Weigert']",In this article we investigate the property of complete monotonicity within a special family $\mathcal{F}_s$ of functions in $s$ variables involving logarithms. The main result of this work provides a linear isomorphism between $\mathcal{F}_s$ and the space of real multivariate polynomials. This isomorphism identifies the cone of completely monotone functions with the cone of non-negative polynomials. We conclude that the cone of completely monotone functions in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is semi-algebraic. This gives a finite time algorithm to decide whether a function in $\mathcal{F}_s$ is completely monotone
2505.04221,New solutions for the symmetrical n-body problem through variational approach and optimisation techniques,"['math.DS', 'math.OC']","['Roberto Ciccarelli', 'Margaux Introna', 'Susanna Terracini', 'Massimiliano Vasile']","Advances in the variational approach to the $n$-body problem have led to significant progress in celestial mechanics, uncovering new types of possible orbits. In this paper, critical points of the Lagrangian action associated with the $n$-body problem are analysed using evolutionary algorithms to identify periodic and symmetrical solutions of the discretised system. A key objective is to locate minimum points of the action functional, as these correspond to feasible periodic solutions that satisfy the system's differential equations. By employing both stochastic and deterministic algorithms, we explore the solution space and obtain numerical representations of these orbits.
  Next, we examine the stability of these orbits by treating them as critical points. One approach is to compute their discrete Morse index to distinguish between minimum points and saddle points. Another is to classify them based on their action levels. Finally, analysing the boundaries of their attraction basins allows us to identify non-minimal critical points via the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz Mountain Pass Theorem. This leads to an updated version of the algorithm that provides a constructive proof of the theorem, yielding new orbits in specific cases.
  This paper builds upon and extends the results presented in \cite{nostro}, providing a more detailed theoretical framework and deeper insights into the formulation. Additionally, we present new numerical results and an extended analysis of the critical points found, further enhancing the findings of the previous study."
2505.04220,Uninorms via two comparable closure operators on bounded lattices,"['math.FA', 'math.LO']","['Zhenyu Xiu', 'Xu Zheng']","In this paper, we propose novel methods for constructing uninorms using two comparable closure operators or, alternatively, two comparable interior operators on bounded lattices. These methods are developed under the necessary and sufficient conditions imposed on these operators. Specifically, the construction of uninorms for $(x ,y )\in ]0 ,e [\times]e ,1 [ \cup ]e ,1 [\times]0 ,e [$ depends not only on the structure of the bounded lattices but also on the chosen closure operators (or interior operators). Consequently, the resulting uninorms do not necessarily belong to $\mathcal{U}_{min}^{*}\cup \mathcal{U}_{min}^{1}$ (or $\mathcal{U}_{max}^{*}\cup\mathcal{U}_{max}^{0}$). Moreover, we present the degenerate cases of the aforementioned results, which are constructed using only a single closure operator or a single interior operator. Some of these cases correspond to well-known results documented in the literature."

2505.04168,Principal Curves In Metric Spaces And The Space Of Probability Measures,['math.ST'],"['Andrew Warren', 'Anton Afanassiev', 'Forest Kobayashi', 'Young-Heon Kim', 'Geoffrey Schiebinger']","We introduce principal curves in Wasserstein space, and in general compact metric spaces. Our motivation for the Wasserstein case comes from optimal-transport-based trajectory inference, where a developing population of cells traces out a curve in Wasserstein space. Our framework enables new experimental procedures for collecting high-density time-courses of developing populations of cells: time-points can be processed in parallel (making it easier to collect more time-points). However, then the time of collection is unknown, and must be recovered by solving a seriation problem (or one-dimensional manifold learning problem).
  We propose an estimator based on Wasserstein principal curves, and prove it is consistent for recovering a curve of probability measures in Wasserstein space from empirical samples. This consistency theorem is obtained via a series of results regarding principal curves in compact metric spaces. In particular, we establish the validity of certain numerical discretization schemes for principal curves, which is a new result even in the Euclidean setting."

It dynamically adjusts the precision for storing vectors and computing, exploiting low precision when appropriate, while maintaining a convergence rate and accuracy comparable to that of double precision PCG. Our mixed precision strategy consists of three main components: (1) The residual and matrix-vector product are initially computed in double precision, and the algorithm switches these to single precision based on the chosen convergence tolerance and an estimate of the residual gap. (2) Depending on the eigenvalue distribution, the preconditioned residual and search direction are either in half precision throughout the iterations or initially in double precision and then stepwise reduced to single and half precision. (3) A dynamically scaled residual is used at every iteration to mitigate underflow in half precision. We provide theoretical support for our estimates and we demonstrate the effectiveness of AMP-PCG through numerical experiments, highlighting both its robustness and the significant performance gains (1.63x speedup) achieved compared to double precision PCG on a GPU."

We investigate proper vertex colorings of graphs whose color classes are mutual-visibility sets. The main concepts that arise in this investigation are independent mutual-visibility (IMV) sets and vertex partitions into these sets (IMV colorings). The IMV number $μ_{i}$ and the IMV chromatic number $χ_{μ_{i}}$ are defined as maximum and minimum cardinality taken over all IMV sets and IMV colorings, respectively. Along the way, we also continue with the study of MV chromatic number $χ_μ$ (as the smallest number of sets in a vertex partition into MV sets), which was initiated in an earlier paper.
  We establish a close connection between the (I)MV chromatic numbers of subdivisions of complete graphs and Ramsey numbers $R(4^k;2)$. From the computational point of view, we prove that the problems of computing $χ_{μ_{i}}$ and $μ_{i}$ are NP-complete, and that it is NP-hard to decide whether a graph $G$ satisfies $\imv(G)=α(G)$ where $α(G)$ is the independence number of $G$. Several tight bounds on $χ_{μ_{i}}$, $χ_μ$ and $μ_{i}$ are given. Exact values/formulas for these parameters in some classical families of graphs are proved. In particular, we prove that $χ_{μ_{i}}(T)=χ_μ(T)$ holds for any tree $T$ of order at least $3$, and determine their exact formulas in the case of lexicographic product graphs. Finally, we give tight bounds on the (I)MV chromatic numbers for the Cartesian and strong product graphs, which lead to exact values in some important families of product graphs."

A graph is said to be detour covered if every vertex lies in a detour. The cummerbund covering number and cummerbund covered graphs are defined similarly. Some of the main results are as follows. (1) Minimum degree and forbidden subgraph conditions that ensure a graph to be cummerbund covered or detour covered. (2) The minimum cummerbund covering number and minimum detour covering number of a graph with connectivity or girth conditions. (3) The minimum cummerbund covering number of a $2$-connected bipartite graph and the extremal graphs.

The phase field, the velocity field and the pressure field are approximated by conforming linear finite elements, nonconforming linear finite elements (Crouzeix-Raviart elements) and piecewise constants, respectively. When compared with the standard conforming counterpart, the nonconforming FEM can provide an approximation with fewer degrees of freedom, leading to improved computational efficiency. We establish the convergence of the resulting numerical scheme in the sense that the sequences of phase-field functions and discrete velocity fields contain subsequences that converge to a minimizing pair of the continuous problem in the $H^1$-norm and a mesh-dependent norm, respectively. We present extensive numerical results to illustrate the performance of the approach, including a comparison with the popular Taylor-Hood elements."

Here, we present a unified framework for solving discrete-time optimal control with higher-order state and control costs of power-law form. By building convex-completion techniques, we derive semi-explicit expressions for control laws, cost-to-go functions, and recursive coefficient dynamics across deterministic and stochastic system settings. Key contributions include variance-aware solutions under additive and multiplicative noise, extensions to mean-field-type-dependent dynamics, and conditions that ensure the positivity of recursive coefficients. In particular, we establish that higher-order costs induce less aggressive control policies compared to quadratic formulations, a finding that is validated through numerical analyses."

We also show that given any filling pair $(α_1,α_2)$ of measured foliations, and every small enough $t>0$, the pair $(tα_1,tα_2)$ is realised as the pair of measured foliations at infinity of some quasi-Fuchsian manifold $M$. This answers questions of Schlenker near the Fuchsian locus."

2505.04092,On the boundary polynomial of a graph,['math.CO'],"['Walter Carballosa', 'Marcos Masip', 'Francisco A. Reyes']","In this work, we introduce the boundary polynomial of a graph $G$ as the ordinary generating function in two variables $B(G;x,y):= \displaystyle\sum_{S\subseteq V(G)} x^{|B(S)|}y^{|S|}$, where $B(S)$ denotes the outer boundary of $S$. We investigate this graph polynomial obtaining some algebraic properties of the polynomial. We found that some parameters of $G$ are algebraically encoded in $B(G;x,y)$, \emph{e.g.}, domination number, Roman domination number, vertex connectivity, and differential of the graph $G$. Furthermore, we compute the boundary polynomial for some classic families of graphs. We also establish some relationships between $B(G;x,y)$ and $B(G^\prime;x,y)$ for the graphs $G^\prime$ obtained by removing, adding, and subdividing an edge from $G$. In addition, we prove that a graph $G$ has an isolated vertex if and only if its boundary polynomial has a factor ($y+1$). Finally, we show that the classes of complete, complete without one edge, empty, path, cycle, wheel, star, double-star graphs, and many others are characterized by the boundary polynomial."
2505.04074,Flip-graphs of non-orientable filling surfaces,"['math.GT', 'math.CO']","['Pallavi Panda', 'Hugo Parlier', 'Lionel Pournin']","Consider a surface $Σ$ with punctures that serve as marked points and at least one marked point on each boundary component. We build a filling surface $Σ_n$ by singling out one of the boundary components and denoting by $n$ the number of marked points it contains. We consider the triangulations of $Σ_n$ whose vertices are the marked points and the associated flip-graph $\mathcal{F}(Σ_n)$. Quotienting $\mathcal{F}(Σ_n)$ by the homeomorphisms of $Σ$ that fix the privileged boundary component results in a finite graph $\mathcal{MF}(Σ_n)$. Bounds on the diameter of $\mathcal{MF}(Σ_n)$ are available when $Σ$ is orientable and we provide corresponding bounds when $Σ$ is non-orientable. We show that the diameter of this graph grows at least like $5n/2$ and at most like $4n$ as $n$ goes to infinity. If $Σ$ is an unpunctured Möbius strip, $\mathcal{MF}(Σ_n)$ coincides with $\mathcal{F}(Σ_n)$ and we prove that the diameter of this graph grows exactly like $5n/2$ as $n$ goes to infinity."

By establishing an integral inequality, we obtain two main results: (1) When a closed complex manifold admits a nonzero parallel $(0,1)$-form, the Dolbeault-Morse-Novikov cohomology must be trivial, which implies that the Hirzebruch $χ_{y}$-genus vanishes. (2) When a closed complex manifold admits a nowhere vanishing $(0,1)$-form, we establish a vanishing theorem for a certain class of twisted Dirac operators, which also forces the Hirzebruch $χ_{y}$-genus to be zero. In particular, we prove that the Hirzebruch $χ_{y}$-genus of a closed complex manifold vanishes if and only if the manifold admits a nowhere vanishing real vector field. These results generalize some classical theorems from Riemannian manifolds to the complex setting. As a culminating application, we prove that the Hirzebruch $χ_{y}$-genus must vanish on closed Gauduchon manifolds admitting positive holomorphic scalar curvature."
2505.04065,Accelerated Gradient Methods Through Variable and Operator Splitting,['math.OC'],"['Long Chen', 'Luo Hao', 'Jingrong Wei']","This paper introduces a unified framework for accelerated gradient methods through the variable and operator splitting (VOS). The operator splitting decouples the optimization process into simpler subproblems, and more importantly, the variable splitting leads to acceleration. The key contributions include the development of strong Lyapunov functions to analyze stability and convergence rates, as well as advanced discretization techniques like Accelerated Over-Relaxation (AOR) and extrapolation by the predictor-corrector methods (EPC). For convex case, we introduce a dynamic updating parameter and a perturbed VOS flow. The framework effectively handles a wide range of optimization problems, including convex optimization, composite convex optimization, and saddle point systems with bilinear coupling."
2505.04063,Tensor robust principal component analysis via the tensor nuclear over Frobenius norm,['math.NA'],"['Huiwen Zheng', 'Yifei Lou', 'Guoliang Tian', 'Chao Wang']","We address the problem of tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA), which entails decomposing a given tensor into the sum of a low-rank tensor and a sparse tensor. By leveraging the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), we introduce the ratio of the tensor nuclear norm to the tensor Frobenius norm (TNF) as a nonconvex approximation of the tensor's tubal rank in TRPCA. Additionally, we utilize the traditional L1 norm to identify the sparse tensor. For brevity, we refer to the combination of TNF and L1 as simply TNF. Under a series of incoherence conditions, we prove that a pair of tensors serves as a local minimizer of the proposed TNF-based TRPCA model if one tensor is sufficiently low in rank and the other tensor is sufficiently sparse. In addition, we propose replacing the L1 norm with the ratio of the L1 and Frobenius norm for tensors, the latter denoted as the LF norm. We refer to the combination of TNF and L1/LF as the TNF+ model in short. To solve both TNF and TNF+ models, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and prove subsequential convergence under certain conditions. Finally, extensive experiments on synthetic data, real color images, and videos are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed models in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in TRPCA."
2505.04061,"Van Lint-MacWilliams' conjecture and maximum cliques in Cayley graphs over finite fields, II","['math.CO', 'math.NT']",['Chi Hoi Yip'],"The well-known Van Lint--MacWilliams' conjecture states that if $q$ is an odd prime power, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ such that $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, and $a-b$ is a square for each $a,b \in A$, then $A$ must be the subfield $\mathbb{F}_q$. This conjecture was first proved by Blokhuis and is often phrased in terms of the maximum cliques in Paley graphs of square order. Previously, Asgarli and the author extended Blokhuis' theorem to a larger family of Cayley graphs. In this paper, we give a new simple proof of Blokhuis' theorem and its extensions. More generally, we show that if $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}^*$ has small multiplicative doubling, and $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $0,1 \in A$, $|A|=q$, such that $A-A \subseteq S \cup \{0\}$, then $A=\mathbb{F}_q$. This new result refines and extends several previous works; moreover, our new approach avoids using heavy machinery from number theory."
2505.04049,A piezoelectric beam model with nonlinear interior dampings and supercritical sources,['math.AP'],"['Menglan Liao', 'Baowei Feng']","This paper aims to investigate a three-dimensional fully magnetic effected piezoelectric beam model with strong sources and nonlinear interior dampings. By employing nonlinear semigroups and the theory of monotone operators, the existence of local weak solutions is established. By the potential well method, we obtain the global existence of potential well solutions. Decay rates of the total energy are obtained in terms of the behavior of the damping terms. The main advantage in this work is that the stabilization estimate does not generate lower-order terms, and in addition we remove some strong conditions in previous results to obtain a weaker energy decay. Finally, when the initial total energy is negative, positive but small, respectively, the blow-up results for weak solutions if the source terms are stronger than damping terms are obtained according to the differential inequality technique. Moreover, if interior dampings are linear, a blow-up result with arbitrarily high initial energy is established by the concavity method and an upper bound for the blow-up time is also derived. All results are independent of any relation among the model coefficients."
2505.04047,A Flexible Algorithmic Framework for Strictly Convex Quadratic Minimization,['math.OC'],"['Liam MacDonald', 'Rua Murray', 'Rachael Tappenden']","This paper presents an algorithmic framework for the minimization of strictly convex quadratic functions. The framework is flexible and generic. At every iteration the search direction is a linear combination of the negative gradient, as well as (possibly) several other `sub-search' directions, where the user determines which, and how many, sub-search directions to include. Then, a step size along each sub-direction is generated in such a way that the gradient is minimized (with respect to a matrix norm), over the hyperplane specified by the user chosen search directions. Theoretical machinery is developed, which shows that any algorithm that fits into the generic framework is guaranteed to converge at a linear rate. Moreover, these theoretical results hold even when relaxation and/or symmetric preconditioning is employed. Several state-of-the-art algorithms fit into this scheme, including steepest descent and conjugate gradients."

We provide a rigorous convergence analysis, showing that the algorithm converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original problem even when the internal solver is a neural network, and the approximation error is bounded. We test our approach on a range of benchmark tasks including quadratic programming (QP), nonconvex programming, and large-scale AC optimal power flow problems. The results demonstrate that compared to existing solvers (e.g., \texttt{OSQP}, \texttt{IPOPT}) and the latest learning-based methods (e.g., DC3, PDL), our approach achieves a superior balance among accuracy, feasibility, and computational efficiency."

We derive the effective equation on the approximate slow manifold in detail by utilizing a finite-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) describing the motion of interfaces. In particular, we verify the equivalence between the full SPDE and the coupled system under small stochastic perturbations. Moreover, we apply our results to effective dynamics of stochastic models with multiplicative white noise, illustrated with four examples on the stochastic damped wave equation, the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation, the stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the stochastic Swift-Hohenberg equation."

2505.04008,On the distribution of topological and spectral indices on random graphs,['math.CO'],"['C. T. Martínez-Martínez', 'R. Aguilar-Sánchez', 'J. A. Méndez-Bermúdez']","We perform a detailed statistical study of the distribution of topological and spectral indices on random graphs $G=(V,E)$ in a wide range of connectivity regimes. First, we consider degree-based topological indices (TIs), and focus on two classes of them: $X_Σ(G) = \sum_{uv \in E} f(d_u,d_v)$ and $X_Π(G) = \prod_{uv \in E} g(d_u,d_v)$, where $uv$ denotes the edge of $G$ connecting the vertices $u$ and $v$, $d_u$ is the degree of the vertex $u$, and $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are functions of the vertex degrees. Specifically, we apply $X_Σ(G)$ and $X_Π(G)$ on Erdös-Rényi graphs and random geometric graphs along the full transition from almost isolated vertices to mostly connected graphs. While we verify that $P(X_Σ(G))$ converges to a standard normal distribution, we show that $P( X_Π(G))$ converges to a log-normal distribution. In addition we also analyze Revan-degree-based indices and spectral indices (those defined from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph adjacency matrix). Indeed, for Revan-degree indices, we obtain results equivalent to those for standard degree-based TIs. Instead, for spectral indices, we report two distinct patterns: the distribution of indices defined only from eigenvalues approaches a normal distribution, while the distribution of those indices involving both eigenvalues and eigenvectors approaches a log-normal distribution."
2505.04004,Bridging the Gap Between Deterministic and Probabilistic Approaches to State Estimation,['math.NA'],"['Lev Kakasenko', 'Alen Alexanderian', 'Mohammad Farazmand', 'Arvind K.

In particular, we focus on modal state estimation, which approximates the unknown state of the system within a prescribed basis. We estimate the coefficients of the modal expansion using available observational data. This is usually accomplished through two distinct frameworks. One is deterministic and estimates the expansion coefficients by solving a least-squares (LS) problem. The second is probabilistic and uses a Bayesian approach to derive a distribution for the coefficients, resulting in the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimate. Here, we seek to quantify and compare the accuracy of these two approaches. To this end, we derive a computable expression for the difference in Bayes risk between the deterministic LS and the Bayesian MAP estimates. We prove that this difference is always nonnegative, indicating that the MAP estimate is always more reliable than the LS estimate. We further show that this difference comprises two nonnegative components representing measurement noise and prior uncertainty, and identify regimes where one component dominates the other in magnitude. We also derive a novel prior distribution from the sample covariance matrix of the training data, and examine the greedy Bayesian and column-pivoted QR (CPQR) sensor placement algorithms with this prior as an input. Using numerical examples, we show that the greedy Bayesian algorithm returns nearly optimal sensor locations. We show that, under certain conditions, the greedy Bayesian sensor locations are identical or nearly identical to those of CPQR when applied to a regularized modal basis."

2505.03996,Spectral inequalities for Schrödinger equations and quantitative propagation of smallness in the plane,['math.AP'],"['Eugenia Malinnikova', 'Jiuyi Zhu']","This paper deals with spectral inequalities for one-dimensional Schrödinger operators with potentials bounded between two increasing functions (weights). The spectral inequality allows one to estimate the norm of a function with bounded spectrum by its values on a certain sensor set. We say that a measurable subset of the real line is thick if the measure of the intersection of this set with any interval of fixed length is bounded from below. First, we consider thick sensor sets a large class of pairs of weights. For potentials constrained between two polynomials, spectral inequalities for a broad class of so-called generalized thick sets are analyzed. A quantitative dependence of the constants in the spectral inequalities on the density of the sensor sets, the growth rate of the potentials, and the spectral interval is established. The proofs rely on a new quantitative propagation of smallness (or quantitative Cauchy uniqueness) for elliptic equations in the plane."

Research in these areas is systematically categorized based on methodologies, including optimization models, machine learning, and simulation, with a focus on their individual strengths and synergies. A notable contribution of this work is its examination of the interplay between machine learning, simulation, and optimization frameworks, highlighting how these approaches can address the dynamic, uncertain, and complex nature of disaster scenarios.

2505.03978,De Rham Theory in Derived Differential Geometry,"['math.AG', 'math.DG', 'math.KT', 'math.SG']",['Gregory Taroyan'],"This paper addresses the question: What is the de Rham theory for general differentiable spaces? We identify two potential answers and study them. In the first part, we show that the de Rham cohomology calculated using (the completion of) the exterior algebra of the cotangent complex yields non-trivial local invariants for singular differentiable spaces. In particular, in some cases, it differs from the constant sheaf cohomology, which provides an obstruction for the de Rham comparison map to be an equivalence. Moreover, we provide conditions under which this local invariant trivializes, yielding a de Rham-type isomorphism. In the second part, we show that for a suitably defined de Rham stack, there is always an isomorphism between functions on it and constant sheaf cohomology of the underlying topological space. Consequently, there exists a version of the de Rham theorem for singular differentiable spaces which holds with almost no restrictions. Finally, we sketch a generalization of this result to other theories of smooth functions, such as holomorphic or analytic functions. The last part is thus related to analytic de Rham stacks of Rodriguez Camargo used by Scholze to geometrize the local Langlands correspondence."

We conjecture that this is always a character, and may be afforded by a projective $RG$-module, where $R$ is an appropriate complete discrete valuation ring whose residue field has characteristic $p$. We examine a number of case where this is the case, and consider consequences for the representation theory and character theory of $G$ when this conjecture is known to hold. In particular, we prove, among other things, that the conjecture is valid for all primes $p$ in the case that $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2,q)$ or ${\rm SL}(2,q)$ for every prime power $q$."

Tyrrell Rockafellar', 'Xuegang', 'Ban']","The growing reliance of intelligent systems on data makes the systems vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Such attacks could compromise machine learning or deep learning models by disrupting the input data. Previous studies on data poisoning attacks are subject to specific assumptions, and limited attention is given to learning models with general (equality and inequality) constraints or lacking differentiability. Such learning models are common in practice, especially in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that involve physical or domain knowledge as specific model constraints. Motivated by ITS applications, this paper formulates a model-target data poisoning attack as a bi-level optimization problem with a constrained lower-level problem, aiming to induce the model solution toward a target solution specified by the adversary by modifying the training data incrementally. As the gradient-based methods fail to solve this optimization problem, we propose to study the Lipschitz continuity property of the model solution, enabling us to calculate the semi-derivative, a one-sided directional derivative, of the solution over data. We leverage semi-derivative descent to solve the bi-level optimization problem, and establish the convergence conditions of the method to any attainable target model. The model and solution method are illustrated with a simulation of a poisoning attack on the lane change detection using SVM."

We describe elementary modifications both in terms of the curve structures as well as on the Picard groups. Together with a description of the nef cone in terms of curve structures, this provides an approach to explicitly computing the Mori fan of the Dolgachev--Nikulin--Voisin family in degree $2$."

A~similar result is obtained for Fourier series on $L^p(\mathbb{T}^n)$, with sequence Lorentz spaces as the target. These findings complement known results, which state that $\mathcal{F}: L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)\to L^{p'}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is finitely strictly singular and then also strictly singular, and provide further insight into the degrees of non-compactness of~$\mathcal{F}$."

Given a large $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$, we consider the fraction of $k$-vertex subsets which span exactly $\ell$ edges. If $\ell$ is 0 or $\binom{k}{r}$, this fraction can be exactly 1 (by taking $G$ to be empty or complete), but for all other values of $\ell$, one might suspect that this fraction is always significantly smaller than 1.
  In this paper we prove an essentially optimal result along these lines: if $\ell$ is not 0 or $\binom{k}{r}$, then this fraction is at most $(1/e) + \varepsilon$, assuming $k$ is sufficiently large in terms of $r$ and $\varepsilon>0$, and $G$ is sufficiently large in terms of $k$. Previously, this was only known for a very limited range of values of $r,k,\ell$ (due to Kwan-Sudakov-Tran, Fox-Sauermann, and Martinsson-Mousset-Noever-Trujić). Our result answers a question of Alon-Hefetz-Krivelevich-Tyomkyn, who suggested this as a hypergraph generalisation of their ""edge-statistics conjecture"".

Consider the $\mathbb C$-algebra $P$ of polynomials in four commuting variables. We turn $P$ into an $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-module on which each element of $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$ acts as a derivation. Then $P$ becomes a direct sum of irreducible $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-modules
  $P = \sum_{N\in \mathbb N} P_N$, where $P_N$ is the $N$th homogeneous component of $P$. For $N\in \mathbb N$ we construct some additional $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-modules ${\rm Fix}(G)$ and $T$. For these modules the underlying vector space is described as follows. Let $X$ denote the vertex set of the hypercube $H(N,2)$, and let $V$ denote the $\mathbb C$-vector space with basis $X$. For the automorphism group $G$ of $H(N,2)$, the action of $G$ on $X$ turns $V$ into a $G$-module. The vector space $V^{\otimes 3} = V \otimes V \otimes V$ becomes a $G$-module such that $g(u \otimes v \otimes w)= g(u) \otimes g(v) \otimes g(w)$ for $g\in G$ and $u,v,w \in V$. The subspace ${\rm Fix}(G)$
  of $V^{\otimes 3}$ consists of the vectors in $V^{\otimes 3}$ that are fixed by every element in $G$.
  Pick $\varkappa \in X$. The corresponding subconstituent algebra $T$ of $H(N,2)$ is the subalgebra of ${\rm End}(V)$ generated by the adjacency map $\sf A$ of $H(N,2)$ and the dual adjacency map ${\sf A}^*$ of $H(N,2)$ with respect to $\varkappa$. In our main results, we turn ${\rm Fix}(G)$ and $T$ into $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-modules, and display $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-module isomorphisms $P_N \to {\rm Fix}(G) \to T$.
  We describe the $\mathfrak{sl}_4(\mathbb C)$-modules $P_N$, ${\rm Fix}(G)$, $T$ from multiple points of view."

  where \(Ω_{\mathrm{T}} = Ω\times (0,\mathrm{T})\) denotes the parabolic cylinder with spatial base \(Ω\) (a bounded domain in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), \(n \geq 2\)) and temporal height \(\mathrm{T} > 0\), \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{T}} = \partial Ω\times (0,\mathrm{T})\), and \(Ω_{0} = Ω\times \{0\}\). Additionally, \(f\) represents the source term of the parabolic equation, while the boundary data are given by \(β\), \(γ\), and \(g\). Our first main result is a global weighted Orlicz-Sobolev estimate for the solution, obtained under asymptotic structural conditions on the differential operator and appropriate assumptions on the boundary data, assuming that the source term belongs to the corresponding weighted Orlicz space. Leveraging these estimates, we demonstrate several applications, including a density result within the fundamental class of parabolic equations, regularity results for the related obstacle problem, and weighted Orlicz-BMO estimates for both the Hessian and the time derivative of the solution. Lastly, we derive variable exponent Morrey-Sobolev estimates for the problem via an extrapolation technique, which are of independent mathematical interest."

2505.03922,Modeling Cascading Driver Interventions in Partially Automated Traffic: A Semi-Markov Chain Approach,"['math.DS', 'math.OC']","['Zihao Li', 'Fan Pu', 'Soyoung Ahn', 'Yang Zhou']","This paper presents an analytical modeling framework for partially automated traffic, incorporating cascading driver intervention behaviors. In this framework, drivers of partially automated vehicles have the flexibility to switch driving modes (either AV or HDV) under lockout constraints. The cascading impact is captured by making the switching probability leader-dependent, highlighting the influence of the leading vehicle on mode choice and the potential propagation of mode changes throughout traffic. Due to the complexity of this system, traditional Markov-based methods are insufficient. To address this, the paper introduces an innovative semi-Markov chain framework with lockout constraints, ideally suited for modeling the system dynamics. This framework reformulates the system as a nonlinear model whose solution can be efficiently approximated using numerical methods from control theory, such as the Runge-Kutta algorithm. Moreover, the system is proven to be a piecewise affine bilinear system, with the existence of solutions and both local and global stability established via Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem and the 1D Uncertainty Polytopes Theorem. Numerical experiments corroborate these theoretical findings, confirming the presence of cascading impacts and elucidating the influence of modeling parameters on traffic throughput, thereby deepening our understanding of the system's properties."

2505.03899,A Graphical Global Optimization Framework for Parameter Estimation of Statistical Models with Nonconvex Regularization Functions,"['math.OC', 'cs.AI', 'math.ST']","['Danial Davarnia', 'Mohammadreza Kiaghadi']","Optimization problems with norm-bounding constraints arise in a variety of applications, including portfolio optimization, machine learning, and feature selection. A common approach to these problems involves relaxing the norm constraint via Lagrangian relaxation, transforming it into a regularization term in the objective function. A particularly challenging class includes the zero-norm function, which promotes sparsity in statistical parameter estimation. Most existing exact methods for solving these problems introduce binary variables and artificial bounds to reformulate them as higher-dimensional mixed-integer programs, solvable by standard solvers. Other exact approaches exploit specific structural properties of the objective, making them difficult to generalize across different problem types. Alternative methods employ nonconvex penalties with favorable statistical characteristics, but these are typically addressed using heuristic or local optimization techniques due to their structural complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method to globally solve optimization problems involving generalized norm-bounding constraints. Our approach encompasses standard $\ell_p$-norms for $p \in [0, \infty)$ and nonconvex penalties such as SCAD and MCP. We leverage decision diagrams to construct strong convex relaxations directly in the original variable space, eliminating the need for auxiliary variables or artificial bounds. Integrated into a spatial branch-and-cut framework, our method guarantees convergence to the global optimum. We demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary computational experiments on benchmark sparse linear regression problems involving complex nonconvex penalties, which are not tractable using existing global optimization techniques."

2505.03754,A Unified Substitution Method for Integration,['math.GM'],['Emmanuel Antonio José García'],"This paper introduces the Unified Substitution Method (USM), a systematic framework for integrating expressions involving inverse trigonometric functions, radicals, and related forms. By synthesizing classical techniques -- such as Euler substitutions, hyperbolic parameterizations, and complex exponential identities -- into a single cohesive strategy, the USM streamlines the evaluation of integrals that traditionally require fragmented, case-specific approaches. Central to the method are novel Euler-like identities that rigorously unify trigonometric, hyperbolic, and algebraic substitutions while preserving domain consistency. These transformations reduce complex integrands to rational or polynomial-like forms, bypassing ad hoc substitutions and memorization of standard formulas. Demonstrations include integrals resistant to standard Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), such as those mixing inverse trigonometric functions, and comparisons with classical Euler substitutions reveal that the latter emerge as special cases within the USM framework. Crucially, the USM extends beyond Euler substitutions by systematically handling diverse forms -- including quadratic radicals with linear shifts, inverse trigonometric integrands, and mixed-function compositions -- under a single principle. The method enhances computational efficiency, clarifies domain-specific sign choices, and serves as a robust educational and practical tool, offering a unified alternative to historically disjointed techniques in integral calculus."

Later that year in his book Liber Quadratorum, Pisano proved that congruums can never perfect squares themselves, a finding that was later revisited by Pierre de Fermat in 1670. His proof is now known as Fermat's Right Triangle Theorem. In this paper, four alternative proofs to Pisano's original proof are demonstrated and offered with each proof requiring a different scope of mathematical knowledge. The proofs are by direct Diophantine analysis, parameterization of differences, Heronian triangle construction, and infinite descent. In showing these proofs, it is demonstrated that there are alternatives to the method of decomposing perfect squares as sums of odd numbers as Pisano did in his proof in 1225."

We prove that the flow is stable with respect to the energy functional and exhibits ergodic behavior in the sense that the evolving maps asymptotically distribute their image uniformly across the moduli space. As a concrete contribution, we show that the sequence of pushforward measures under the flow converges weak--$^{*}$ to the normalized hyperbolic measure on \( \mathcal{M}_1 \). Moreover, we introduce a relative entropy framework to measure the statistical deviation of the flow from equilibrium and prove that the relative entropy with respect to the hyperbolic measure decays to zero in the long-time limit. This provides a quantitative refinement of the ergodic result and establishes a connection between geometric flows, moduli space dynamics, and information-theoretic convergence."

This paper studies first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise in a decentralized setup, where each node can only communicate with its direct neighbors in a predefined graph. Specifically, we consider a class of heavy-tailed gradient noise that is zero-mean and has only $p$-th moment for $p \in (1, 2]$. We propose GT-NSGDm, Gradient Tracking based Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, that utilizes normalization, in conjunction with gradient tracking and momentum, to cope with heavy-tailed noise on distributed nodes. We show that, when the communication graph admits primitive and doubly stochastic weights, GT-NSGDm guarantees, for the \textit{first} time in the literature, that the expected gradient norm converges at an optimal non-asymptotic rate $O\big(1/T^{(p-1)/(3p-2)}\big)$, which matches the lower bound in the centralized setup. When tail index $p$ is unknown, GT-NSGDm attains a non-asymptotic rate $O\big( 1/T^{(p-1)/(2p)} \big)$ that is, for $p < 2$, topology independent and has a speedup factor $n^{1-1/p}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$. Finally, experiments on nonconvex linear regression with tokenized synthetic data and decentralized training of language models on a real-world corpus demonstrate that GT-NSGDm is more robust and efficient than baselines."

Building on a novel dual$^2$ approach, we develop two accelerated algorithms to solve this problem: the inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (iD2A) gradient method and the Multi-consensus inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (MiD2A) gradient method. We demonstrate that both iD2A and MiD2A can guarantee asymptotic convergence under a milder condition on $h$ compared to existing algorithms. Furthermore, under additional assumptions, we establish linear convergence rates and derive significantly lower communication and computational complexity bounds than those of existing algorithms.

We investigate whether benign nonconvexity continues to hold when the factor matrices are constrained to be elementwise nonnegative -- a common practical requirement. In the simple setting of a rank-1 nonnegative ground truth, we confirm that benign nonconvexity holds in the fully-observed case with RIP constant $δ=0$. Surprisingly, however, this property fails to extend to the partially-observed case with any arbitrarily small RIP constant $δ\to0^{+}$, irrespective of rank overparameterization. This finding exposes a critical theoretical gap: the continuity argument widely used to explain the empirical robustness of low-rank matrix recovery fundamentally breaks down once nonnegative constraints are imposed."
2505.03706,Policy Gradient Adaptive Control for the LQR: Indirect and Direct Approaches,"['math.OC', 'eess.SY']","['Feiran Zhao', 'Alessandro Chiuso', 'Florian Dörfler']","Motivated by recent advances of reinforcement learning and direct data-driven control, we propose policy gradient adaptive control (PGAC) for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), which uses online closed-loop data to improve the control policy while maintaining stability. Our method adaptively updates the policy in feedback by descending the gradient of the LQR cost and is categorized as indirect, when gradients are computed via an estimated model, versus direct, when gradients are derived from data using sample covariance parameterization. Beyond the vanilla gradient, we also showcase the merits of the natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods for the policy update. Notably, natural gradient descent bridges the indirect and direct PGAC, and the Gauss-Newton method of the indirect PGAC leads to an adaptive version of the celebrated Hewer's algorithm. To account for the uncertainty from noise, we propose a regularization method for both indirect and direct PGAC. For all the considered PGAC approaches, we show closed-loop stability and convergence of the policy to the optimal LQR gain. Simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of PGAC."

We obtain sharp inequalities relating four notions of vector valued optimal transport and prove that the distances are mutually bi-Hölder equivalent. We discuss the theoretical and practical advantages of each metric and indicate potential applications in multispecies PDE and data analysis. In particular, one of the static formulations discussed in the paper is amenable to linearization, a technique that has been explored in recent years to accelerate the computation of pairwise optimal transport distances."

Additionally, we employ a meta-learning method to search for initial parameters that can quickly adapt to upcoming target investment tasks, effectively providing a set of well-suited initial strategies. Subsequently, we update the initial parameters using the target tasks and determine the optimal mixture weights for these candidate policies. Empirical tests show that our algorithm excels in terms of training time and data requirements, making it particularly suitable for high-frequency algorithmic trading. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct numerical tests on cross-training datasets, demonstrating its excellent transferability and robustness."
2505.03657,m-accretive extensions of Friedrichs operators,['math.AP'],"['Krešimir Burazin', 'Marko Erceg', 'Sandeep Kumar Soni']","The introduction of abstract Friedrichs operators in 2007-an operator-theoretic framework for studying classical Friedrichs operators has led to significant developments in the field, including results on well-posedness, multiplicity, and classification. More recently, the von Neumann extension theory has been explored in this context, along with connections between abstract Friedrichs operators and skew-symmetric operators.
  In this work, we show that all m-accretive extensions of abstract Friedrichs operators correspond precisely to those satisfying (V)-boundary conditions. We also establish a connection between the m-accretive extensions of abstract Friedrichs operators and their skew-symmetric components. Additionally, the three equivalent formulations of boundary conditions are unified within a single interpretive framework. To conclude, we discuss a constructive relation between (V)- and (M)-boundary conditions and examine the multiplicity of the associated M-operators. We demonstrate our results on two examples, namely, the first order ordinary differential equation on an interval, with various boundary conditions, and the second-order elliptic partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions."
2505.03636,On the optimal stopping of Gauss-Markov bridges with random pinning points,"['math.PR', 'stat.AP']","['Abel Azze', ""Bernardo D'Auria""]","We consider the optimal stopping problem for a Gauss-Markov process conditioned to adopt a prescribed terminal distribution. By applying a time-space transformation, we show it is equivalent to stopping a Brownian bridge pinned at a random endpoint with a time-dependent payoff. We prove that the optimal rule is the first entry into the stopping region, and establish that the value function is Lipschitz continuous on compacts via a coupling of terminal pinning points across different initial conditions. A comparison theorems then order value functions according to likelihood-ratio ordering of terminal densities, and when these densities have bounded support, we bound the optimal boundary by that of a Gauss-Markov bridge. Although the stopping boundary need not be the graph of a function in general, we provide sufficient conditions under which this property holds, and identify strongly log-concave terminal densities that guarantee this structure. Numerical experiments illustrate representative boundary shapes."
2505.03634,Constructible tori over Dedekind schemes,"['math.AG', 'math.NT']","['Adrien Morin', 'Takashi Suzuki']","We introduce an exact category of torsion-free constructible tori and an abelian category of constructible tori over a Dedekind scheme with perfect residue fields. The first one has an explicit description as $2$-term complexes of smooth commutative group algebraic spaces. Using the second-named author's duality results arXiv:1806.07641, we prove that they are equivalent to the opposite of the categories of torsion-free $\mathbb{Z}$-constructible sheaves and all $\mathbb{Z}$-constructible sheaves, respectively. We then define $L$-functions for constructible tori over a Dedekind scheme proper over $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$ in terms of their étale realizations and prove a special value formula at $s=0$ using the Weil-étale formalism developed by the first-named author in arXiv:2210.09102. This extends the results of the first-named author by removing the tame ramification hypothesis."
2505.03630,On Loewner energy and curve composition,['math.CV'],"['Tim Mesikepp', 'Yaosong Yang']","The composition $γ\circ η$ of Jordan curves $γ$ and $η$ in universal Teichmüller space is defined through the composition $h_γ\circ h_η$ of their conformal weldings. We show that whenever $γ$ and $η$ have finite Loewner energy $I^L$, the energy of their composition satisfies $$I^L(γ\circ η) \lesssim_K I^L(γ) + I^L(η),$$ with an explicit constant in terms of the quasiconformal $K$ of $γ$ and $η$. We also study the asymptotic growth rate of the Loewner energy under $n$ self-compositions $γ^n := γ\circ \cdots \circ γ$, showing $$\limsup_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}\log I^L(γ^n) \lesssim_K 1,$$ again with explicit constant.
  Our approach is to define a new conformally-covariant rooted welding functional $W_h(y)$, and show $W_h(y) \asymp_K I^L(γ)$ when $h$ is a welding of $γ$ and $y$ is any root (a point in the domain of $h$). In the course of our arguments we also give several new expressions for the Loewner energy, including generalized formulas in terms of the Riemann maps $f$ and $g$ for $γ$ which hold irrespective of the placement of $γ$ on the Riemann sphere, the normalization of $f$ and $g$, and what disks $D, \overline{D}^c \subset \hatC$ serve as domains. An additional corollary is that $I^L(γ)$ is bounded above by a constant only depending on the Weil--Petersson distance from $γ$ to the circle."
2505.03625,Numerical Reconstruction and Analysis of Backward Semilinear Subdiffusion Problems,['math.NA'],"['Xu Wu', 'Jiang Yang', 'Zhi Zhou']","This paper aims to develop and analyze a numerical scheme for solving the backward problem of semilinear subdiffusion equations. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and conditional stability of the solution to the inverse problem by applying the smoothing and asymptotic properties of solution operators and constructing a fixed-point iteration. This derived conditional stability further inspires a numerical reconstruction scheme. To address the mildly ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ the quasi-boundary value method for regularization. A fully discrete scheme is proposed, utilizing the finite element method for spatial discretization and convolution quadrature for temporal discretization. A thorough error analysis of the resulting discrete system is provided for both smooth and nonsmooth data. This analysis relies on the smoothing properties of discrete solution operators, some nonstandard error estimates optimal with respect to data regularity in the direct problem, and the arguments used in stability analysis. The derived a priori error estimate offers guidance for selecting the regularization parameter and discretization parameters based on the noise level. Moreover, we propose an easy-to-implement iterative algorithm for solving the fully discrete scheme and prove its linear convergence. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical estimates and demonstrate the necessity of the assumption required in the analysis."
2505.03619,Fujita exponent for the fractional sub-Laplace semilinear heat equation with forcing term on the Heisenberg group,['math.AP'],"['Priyank Oza', 'Durvudkhan Suragan']","In this paper, we study the semilinear heat equation with a forcing term, driven by the fractional sub-Laplacian (-Δ_{\mathbbm{H}^N})^s of order $s\in (0,1),$ on the Heisenberg group $\mathbbm{H}^N$. We establish that the Fujita exponent, a critical threshold that delimits different dynamical regimes of this equation, is $$p_F\coloneqq\frac{Q}{Q-2s},$$ where $Q\coloneqq 2N+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbbm{H}^N$. We prove the existence of global-in-time solutions for the supercritical case $(p>p_F),$ and the non-existence of global-in-time solutions for the subcritical case $(1<p<p_F).$ For the critical case $p=p_F,$ we provide a class of functions for which the solution blows up in finite time. These results extend the classical Fujita phenomenon to a sub-Riemannian setting with the nonlocal effects of the fractional sub-Laplacian. Our proof methods intertwine analytic techniques with the geometric structure of the Heisenberg group."

The algorithm features a self-adaptive strategy that eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant and incorporate a conjugate gradient-type direction to enhance convergence speed.

Using this result, we prove the strong convergence of the proposed method and provide numerical experiments to demonstrate its computational efficacy and robustness."
2505.03613,The Li-Lin's open problem on $\mathbb{R}^N$,"['math.AP', 'math.FA']","['Zhi-Yun Tang', 'Xianhua Tang']","In 2012, Y.Y. Li and C.-S. Lin (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 203(3): 943-968) posed an open problem concerning the existence of positive solutions to the elliptic equation $$
  \begin{cases}
  -Δu = -λ|x|^{-s_1}|u|^{p-2}u + |x|^{-s_2}|u|^{q-2}u & \text{in } Ω,
  u = 0 & \text{on } \partial Ω,
  \end{cases} $$ for $λ> 0$, $p > q = 2^*(s_2)$, $0 \leq s_1 < s_2 < 2$, and $2^*(s) = \frac{2(N-s)}{N-2}$ denotes the Hardy-Sobolev critical exponent, initially studied in bounded domains $Ω\subset \mathbb{R}^N$, $N \geq 3$. Currently, research on this open problem remains limited, and a complete resolution is still far from being achieved.
  Motivated by the need to address this open problem in more general settings, we extend our investigation to the entire space $\mathbb{R}^N$, focusing on the equation $$ -Δu + u = -λ|x|^{-s_1}|u|^{p-2}u + |x|^{-s_2}|u|^{q-2}u \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N. $$
  Our analysis reveals stark contrasts between bounded and unbounded domains: in $\mathbb{R}^N$, the equation admits no solution when $q = 2^*(s_2)$ for any $λ> 0$, whereas a positive solution exists when $q < 2^*(s_2)$.
  To establish these results, we employ the Nehari manifold method; however, the functional's unboundedness from below on the manifold causes standard global minimization techniques to be inapplicable. Instead, we characterize a local minimizer of the energy functional on the Nehari manifold, overcoming the challenge posed by the lack of a global minimizer."

By using a new div-curl lemma which was first introduced by the third author to establish a bilinear estimate, and also the interaction Morawetz estimate, the global well-posedness for the skew mean curvature flow in the critical Besov space is established, and hence the corresponding result obtained by Huang, Li and Tataru (Int.

Gfrerer and J. V. Outrata. In the setting of Banach spaces, we analyse its stability under Lipschitz continuous perturbations and establish its uniformity over compact sets. Our results ensure that the property is preserved under small Lipschitz perturbations, which is crucial for maintaining robustness in variational analysis. Furthermore, we apply the developed theory to parametric inclusion problems. The analysis demonstrates that the uniformity of strong metric subregularity provides a theoretical foundation for addressing stability issues in parametrized optimization and control applications."
2505.03598,An Enriched Immersed Finite Element Method for 3D Interface Problems,['math.NA'],"['Ruchi Guo', 'Xu Zhang']","We introduce an enriched immersed finite element method for addressing interface problems characterized by general non-homogeneous jump conditions. Unlike many existing unfitted mesh methods, our approach incorporates a homogenization concept. The IFE trial function set is composed of two components: the standard homogeneous IFE space and additional enrichment IFE functions. These enrichment functions are directly determined by the jump data, without adding extra degrees of freedom to the system. Meanwhile, the homogeneous IFE space is isomorphic to the standard finite element space on the same mesh. This isomorphism remains stable regardless of interface location relative to the mesh, ensuring optimal $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ conditioning that is independent of the interface location and facilitates an immediate development of a multigrid fast solver; namely the iteration numbers are independent of not only the mesh size but also the relative interface location. Theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments are carried out in the efforts to demonstrate these features."

It is the constant-curvature analogue of the exponential family from the information-geometric point of view, but the development of computational methodologies is still in an early stage. In this paper, we propose a fixed point iteration for maximum likelihood estimation under i.i.d.~sampling, and prove using the duality that the likelihood is monotone along the iterations. We illustrate the algorithm with the $q$-Gaussian distribution and the Dirichlet perturbation."

We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching architecture, and a simpler model of optimal inference in a generalized linear model. This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the ""deep Gaussian equivalence principle"" conjectured in Cui et al. (2023) (arXiv:2302.00375). Our result highlights that in order to escape this ""trivialisation"" of deep neural networks (in the sense of reduction to a linear model) happening in the strongly overparametrized proportional regime, models trained from much more data have to be considered."

For every $r\in [0,1)$, there exists a unique sequence $(c_n)_{n\in\mathbb N_+}$ in $\mathbb N$ such that $r= \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{c_n}{u_n}$, with $c_n<b_n$ for every $n\in\mathbb N_+$, and $c_n<b_n-1$ for infinitely many $n\in\mathbb N_+$; let $\mathrm{supp}(r):=\{n\in\mathbb N_+: c_n\neq0\}$ and $\mathrm{supp}_b(r):=\{n\in\mathbb N_+: c_n = b_n-1\}$. For $x=r+\mathbb Z\in \mathbb T$, let $\mathrm{supp}(x) = \mathrm{supp}(r)$ and $\mathrm{supp}_b(x) = \mathrm{supp}_b(r)$.
  For an ideal $\mathcal I$ of $\mathbb N$, an element $x$ of the circle group $\mathbb T$ is called a topologically $\mathbf u_\mathcal I$-torsion element of $\mathbb T$ if $u_nx$ $\mathcal I$-converges to $0$, that is, $\{n\in \mathbb N: u_nx \not \in U\}\in \mathcal I$ for every neighborhood $U$ of $0$ in $\mathbb T$. In this paper, under suitable conditions on the ideal $\mathcal I$, we completely describe the $\mathbf u_\mathcal I$-torsion elements $x$ of $\mathbb T$ with $\lim_{n\in\mathrm{supp}(x)}b_n=\infty$ and those with $\{b_n:n\in\mathrm{supp}(x)\}$ bounded.
  According to Corollary 2.12 in [A. Ghosh, Ric. Mat. 73 (2024), 2263--2281], an element $x \in\mathbb T$ with $\{b_n:n\in\mathrm{supp}(x)\}$ bounded is topologically $\mathbf u_\mathcal I$-torsion if and only if $\mathrm{supp}(x)+1\setminus \mathrm{supp}(x)\in \mathcal I$ and $\mathrm{supp}(x) \setminus \mathrm{supp}_b(x) \in \mathcal I$. We characterize the ideals $\mathcal I$ of $\mathbb N$, naming them nested, such that this equivalence holds and we provide examples of non-nested ideals $\mathcal I$ that satisfy the above mentioned suitable conditions, so that the equivalence claimed by Ghosh fails for those $\mathcal I$."

In the process, we develop a stacky approach to diffracted Hodge cohomology as introduced by Bhatt--Lurie which also captures the conjugate filtration and the Sen operator. In the appendix, we also introduce a stack computing the conjugate filtration on absolute Hodge--Tate cohomology."

The quasi-Minnaert resonance consists of boundary localization and surface resonance for the generated internal total and external scattered wave fields associated with the hard inclusion. It possesses similar quantitative behaviours as those for the classical Minnaert resonance due to high-contrast material structures, but occurs for a continuous spectrum of frequencies instead of certain discrete Minnaert resonant frequencies. We present a comprehensive analysis to uncover the physical origin and the mechanism of this new physical phenomenon. It is shown that the delicate high-contrast material structures and the properly tailored incident waves which are coupled together in a subtle manner play a crucial role in ensuring such phenomena. The stress concentration phenomena in both the internal total field and the scattered field components are also rigorously established. The analysis in this paper is deeply rooted in layer potential theory and intricate asymptotic analysis. We believe that our findings can have a significant impact on the theory of composite materials and metamaterials."

In univariate settings, methods such as the sample median and trimmed means balance robustness and efficiency by mitigating the influence of extreme observations. This paper extends these robust techniques to the multivariate context through the use of data depth functions, which provide a natural means to order and rank multidimensional data. We review several depth measures and discuss their role in generalizing trimmed mean estimators beyond one dimension.
  Our main contributions are twofold: first, we prove the almost sure consistency of the multivariate trimmed mean estimator under mixing conditions; second, we establish a general limit distribution theorem for a broad family of depth-based estimators, encompassing popular examples such as Tukey's and projection depth. These theoretical advancements not only enhance the understanding of robust location estimation in high-dimensional settings but also offer practical guidelines for applications in areas such as machine learning, economic analysis, and financial risk assessment.
  A small example with simulated data is performed, varying the depth measure used and the percentage of trimmed data."

Next, we investigate Lorentzian geodesics for optimality: we find the cut time and the cut locus. As a geometric application we compute the injectivity radius of the corresponding Lorentzian manifold."

  We derive the heavy traffic limit of the stationary queue length distribution of this multi-level queue in a closed form, which agrees with the stationary distribution of the reflected diffusion obtained by Miyazawa (2024, Journal of the Indian Society for Probability and Statistics). Thus, those results show the limit interchange of process and stationary distribution in heavy traffic.
  The multi-level queue is a simpler version of the 2-level GI/G/1 queue of Miyazawa (2025, Advances in Applied Probability, to appear) and its extension for multi-levels. For this 2-level queue in heavy traffic, the process limit is unknown, and the distributional limit is obtained for limited cases under extra conditions. Nevertheless, it is shown that the method developed in Miyazawa (2025) perfectly works for the present multi-level queue."

The set of admissible controls is characterized by $u\in L^p(I,U)$, $1<p<\infty$, $I=[0,ν]$, where $U$ is a uniformly convex Banach space. Assuming partial null controllability for the fractional-order linear system with a source term, we employ an approximate solvability method to simplify the problem to reduce it to finite-dimensional subspaces. Consequently, the solutions of the original problem are obtained as limiting functions within these subspaces. The paper tackles a challenge stemming from the assumption that $U$ is a uniformly convex Banach space, which introduces convexity issues in constructing the required control. These complications do not occur if $U$ is a separable Hilbert space. This study introduces a novel approach by resolving the convexity issue, thereby enabling $L^p(I, U)$ partially null controllability of the semilinear fractional-order differential control system, with $U$ being a uniformly convex Banach space."

The presented approach extends and simplifies known density conditions for Bergman kernels and lattices in semisimple Lie groups.
2505.03413,Normal $4$-pseudomanifolds with a relative 2-skeleton,"['math.CO', 'math.GT']","['Biplab Basak', 'Mangaldeep Saha', 'Sourav Sarkar']","The study of face-number-related invariants in simplicial complexes is a central topic in combinatorial topology. Among these, the invariant $g_2$ plays a significant role. For a normal $d$-pseudomanifold $K$ ($d \geq 3$), it is known that $g_2(K) \geq g_2(lk(v, K))$ for every vertex $v$. If $K$ has at most two singularities and satisfies $g_2(K) = g_2(lk(t, K))$ for a singular vertex $t$, then $g_3(K) \geq g_3(lk(t,K))$ holds. A normal $d$-pseudomanifold $K$ is called $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal if $g_2(K) = g_2(lk (t,K))$ and $g_3(K) = g_3(lk (t,K))$ for a singular vertex $t$.
  In this article, we establish structural results for normal $4$-pseudomanifolds under $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimality conditions. We show that if $K$ is a normal $4$-pseudomanifold with exactly one singular vertex $t$ and is $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at $t$, then $K$ can be obtained from boundary complexes of $5$-simplices through a sequence of operations of types vertex foldings and connected sums. When $K$ has exactly two singularities and is $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at one singular vertex, it is derived from the boundary complexes of $4$-simplices through a sequence of operations of types one-vertex suspensions, vertex foldings, and connected sums. Alternatively, we prove that if $K$ has two singular vertices and is $g_2$- and $g_3$-optimal at one of them, then it arises from boundary complexes of $5$-simplices through a sequence of operations of types vertex foldings, edge foldings, and connected sums."

We show that under suitable assumptions, both geometrical and analytical in nature, the flat-regularized determinant of $D_τ$, restricted to the subspace $\mathrm{im}(δ_τ)$, is constant in $τ$. The general result we present implies both local constancy of the Ray--Singer torsion and of the value at zero of the Ruelle zeta function for a contact Anosov flow, upon choosing $δ_τ= δ_{g_τ}$, the Hodge codifferential for a family of metrics, and $δ_τ=ι_{X_τ}$, the contraction along a family of (regular, contact) Anosov vector fields, respectively."

Without assuming that the space domain is convex, we construct a Maxwellian lower bound in the cutoff case, and a weaker-than-Maxwellian lower bound in the non-cutoff case, thus extending results of \cite{Bri 1,Bri 2} in which the domain was assumed to be convex."

We assume that the projection of $Γ$ onto $\text{Sim} (\mathbb R^q)$ contains a non-isometric similarity. This construction, when $N$ is a symmetric space of non-compact type, is a generalization of the well-known Inoue surfaces. We prove that this situation is in fact equivalent to that of so-called LCP manifolds. We show a Bieberbach rigidity result in the case of symmetric spaces, providing a way to construct admissible groups $Γ$. We also consider the projection of $Γ$ onto $\text{Isom}(N)$ in the case where $N$ has negative curvature, leading to some classification results."

Multidimensional continued fractions are a generalization of classical continued fractions, introduced by Jacobi, and there are many well-studied open problems related to them. In this paper, we establish transcendence criteria for multidimensional continued fractions. In particular, we show that some Liouville-type and quasi-periodic multidimensional continued fractions are transcendental. We also obtain an upper bound on the naive height of cubic irrationals arising from periodic multidimensional continued fractions and exploit it to prove the transcendence criteria in the quasi-periodic case."

It can be seen that the answer is reliant on whether the characteristic of the base field is two, and thus these ideals constitute a class of ideals whose algebraic properties depend on characteristics of the base field."
2505.03360,Hierarchical dynamic domain decomposition for the multiscale Boltzmann equation,['math.NA'],"['Domenico Caparello', 'Lorenzo Pareschi', 'Thomas Rey']","In this work, we present a hierarchical domain decomposition method for the multi-scale Boltzmann equation based on moment realizability matrices, a concept introduced by Levermore, Morokoff, and Nadiga in \cite{lev-mor-nad-1998}. This criterion is used to dynamically partition the two-dimensional spatial domain into three regimes: the Euler regime, an intermediate kinetic regime governed by the ES-BGK model, and the full Boltzmann regime. The key advantage of this approach lies in the use of Euler equations in regions where the flow is near hydrodynamic equilibrium, the ES-BGK model in moderately non-equilibrium regions where a fluid description is insufficient but full kinetic resolution is not yet necessary, and the full Boltzmann solver where strong non-equilibrium effects dominate, such as near shocks and boundary layers. This allows for both high accuracy and significant computational savings, as the Euler solver and the ES-BGK models are considerably cheaper than the full kinetic Boltzmann model.
  To ensure accurate and efficient coupling between regimes, we employ asymptotic-preserving (AP) numerical schemes and fast spectral solvers for evaluating the Boltzmann collision operator. Among the main novelties of this work are the use of a full 2D spatial and 3D velocity decomposition, the integration of three distinct physical regimes within a unified solver framework, and a parallelized implementation exploiting CPU multithreading. This combination enables robust and scalable simulation of multiscale kinetic flows with complex geometries."
2505.03347,Variable projection framework for the reduced-rank matrix approximation problem by weighted least-squares,"['math.NA', 'math.OC']",['Pascal Terray'],"In this monograph, we review and develop variable projection Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt and Newton methods for the Weighted Low-Rank Approximation (WLRA) problem, which has now an increasing number of applications in many scientific fields. Particular attention is drawn at the robustness, efficiency and scalability of these variable projection second-order algorithms such that they can be used also on larger datasets now commonly found in many practical problems for which only first-order algorithms based on sequential repetitions of local optimization (e.g., majorization, Expectation-Maximization or alternating least-squares methods) or variations of gradient descent (e.g., conjugate, proximal or stochastic gradient descent methods), or hybrid algorithms from these two classes of methods, were only feasible due to their lower cost and memory requirement per iteration. In parallel with this review of variable projection algorithms, we develop new formulae for the Jacobian and Hessian matrices involved in these variable projection methods and demonstrate their very specific properties such as the uniform rank deficiency of the Jacobian matrix or the rank deficiency of the Hessian matrix at the (local) minimizers of the cost function associated with the WLRA problem. These systematic deficiencies must be taken into account in any practical implementations of the algorithms. These different properties and the very particular geometry of the WLRA problem have not been well appreciated in the past and have been the main obstacles in the development of robust variable projection second-order algorithms for solving the WLRA problem. In addition, we demonstrate that the variable projection framework gives original insights on the solvability, the landscape and the non-smoothness of the WLRA problem. It also helps to describe the tight links between previously unrelated methods, which have been proposed to solve it. Specifically, we illustrate the closed links between the variable projection framework and Riemannian optimization on the Grassmann manifold for the WLRA problem. We expect that software's developers and practitioners in different fields such as computer vision, signal processing, recommender systems, machine learning, multivariate statistics and geophysical sciences will benefit from the results in this monograph in order to devise more robust and accurate algorithms to solve the WLRA problem."

This enables us to bypass the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD)-based system identification step in conventional Koopman-based methods and design controllers for nonlinear systems directly from data. Leveraging this result, we develop a Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) framework for nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics. A case study demonstrates that our direct data-driven control method achieves improved optimality compared to conventional Koopman-based methods. Furthermore, in examples where an exact Koopman realization with a finite-dimensional lifting function set of the controlled nonlinear system does not exist, our method exhibits advanced robustness to finite Koopman approximation errors compared to existing methods."

By leveraging the Energy-Distance (ED) kernel, which can be approximated by its sliced one-dimensional projections, each computable in O(n log n), our method avoids hyperparameter tuning and enables efficient large-scale optimization. The main issue to be solved is the lack of regularity of the ED kernel. To this goal, we introduce two models that regularize the deformations and retain a low computational footprint. The first model relies on TV regularization, while the second model avoids the non-smooth TV regularization at the cost of restricting its use to the space of measures, or cloud of points. Last, we demonstrate the numerical robustness and scalability of our models on synthetic and real data."

However, because these models are trained on images from diverse sources, they risk memorizing and reproducing specific content, raising concerns about intellectual property (IP) infringement. Recent advances in prompt engineering offer a cost-effective way to enhance generative AI performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in mitigating IP infringement risks in image generation. Our findings show that Chain of Thought Prompting and Task Instruction Prompting significantly reduce the similarity between generated images and the training data of diffusion models, thereby lowering the risk of IP infringement."

The sharp $L^p$ estimate was previously obtained by Stein\;\cite{stein1} and Bourgain-Guth \cite{BG} via the $TT^\ast$ and multilinear methods, respectively. We provide a unified proof based on the bilinear method for both odd and even dimensions. The strategy is inspired by Barron's work \cite{Bar} on the restriction problem. The decoupling theorem for the Hörmander oscillatory integral operator can be obtained by the approach in \cite{BHS}, where the key observation can be roughly formulated as follows: in a physical space of sufficiently small scale, the variable setting can be essentially viewed as translation-invariant. In contrast, we reprove the decoupling theorem for the Hörmander oscillatory integral operator through the Pramanik-Seeger approximation approach \cite{PS}. Both proofs rely on a scale-dependent induction argument, which can be used to deal with perturbation terms in the phase function."

PBW bases for all (truncated) shifted twisted Yangians of type AI and AII are established along the way. Applying the theory of universal equivariant quantizations of conic symplectic singularities we show that the truncated twisted shifted Yangian is isomorphic to the finite $W$-algebra which quantizes a suitable Slodowy slice. This provides a presentation of the finite $W$-algebra associated with every even nilpotent element in type {\sf B} and {\sf C}, as well as every nilpotent element with two Jordan blocks in type {\sf D}. Finally we make a conjecture which would supply presentations in the remaining even cases in type {\sf D}."

A Robin boundary condition is imposed at z = b(t) to prevent individuals from leaving the domain, so that the shifting boundary acts as an impermeable wall-a ''piston''-that sweeps the individuals it encounters. Our analysis focuses on the cases where b(t) $\sim$ ct^$β$ with $β$ $\in$ [0, 1]. We prove quantitative convergence results characterized by attraction toward self-similar profiles, based on entropy techniques and Duhamel's principle. When $β$ goes through the critical value 1/2, the shape of the self-similar asymptotic profile switches from Gaussian to exponential. In particular, this profile turns out to be stationary when $β$ = 1, reflecting a delicate balance between diffusion and advection induced by the moving boundary."

  We provide our investigations for three spaces of functions: continuous, regulated, and $L^p$. We compare our results for these three cases, showing how the hypotheses change according to the space that we are treating. Finally, we provide applications of our results to difference equations with state-dependent delays for the cases of continuous and regulated function spaces, as well as to transport equations in one space dimension with time-dependent velocity."

For the Rayleigh-Taylor instability these are the first turbulently mixing solutions known to respect local energy dissipation, and outside the range of Atwood numbers considered in arXiv:2002.08843, the first weakly admissible solutions in general. In the coarse grained picture the existence relies on one-dimensional subsolutions described by a family of hyperbolic conservation laws, among which one can find the optimal background profile appearing in the scale invariant bounds from arXiv:2303.01889, and as we show, the optimal conservation law with respect to maximization of the total energy dissipation."

It is known that the nonlinear Schr{ö}dinger (NLS) equation on periodic metric graphs can be reduced asymptotically on long but finite time intervals to the homogeneous NLS equation, which admits traveling solitary wave solutions. In order to address persistence of such traveling waves beyond finite time intervals, we formulate the existence problem for traveling waves via spatial dynamics. There exist no spatially decaying (solitary) waves because of an infinite-dimensional center manifold in the spatial dynamics formulation. Existence of traveling modulating pulse solutions which are solitary waves with small oscillatory tails at very long distances from the pulse core is proven by using a local center-saddle manifold. We show that the variational formulation fails to capture existence of such modulating pulse solutions even in the singular limit of zero wave speeds where true (standing) solitary waves exist. Propagation of a traveling solitary wave and formation of a small oscillatory tail outside the pulse core is shown in numerical simulations of the NLS equation on the periodic graph."

Building on recent results in the literature, we examine whether the assumption that at least one of the input GLT symbols is invertible almost everywhere (a.e.) is necessary. Since inversion is mainly required due to the non-commutativity of the matrix product, it was conjectured that the hypothesis on the invertibility of the GLT symbols can be removed. In fact, we prove the conjectured statement that is \[ \{G(A_n, B_n)\}_n \sim_{\mathrm{GLT}} (κξ)^{1/2} \] when the symbols $κ, ξ$ commute, which implies the important case where $r=1$ and $d \geq 1 $, while the statement is generally false or even not well posed when the symbols are not invertible a.e. and do not commute. In fact, numerical experiments are conducted in the case where the two symbols do not commute, showing that the main results of the present work are maximal. Further numerical experiments, visualizations, and conclusions end the present contribution."

2505.03240,A novel implementation of Yau-Yau filter for time-variant nonlinear problems,['math.OC'],"['Yuzhong Hu', 'Jiayi Kang', 'Lei Ma', 'Xiaoming Zhang']","Nonlinear filter has long been an important problem in practical industrial applications. The Yau-Yau method is a highly versatile framework that transforms nonlinear filtering problems into initial-value problems governed by the Forward Kolmogorov Equation (FKE). Previous researches have shown that the method can be applied to highly nonlinear and high dimensional problems. However, when time-varying coefficients are involved in the system models, developing an implementation of the method with high computational speed and low data storage still presents a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel numerical algorithm that incorporates physics-informed neural network (PINN) and principal component analysis (PCA) to solve the FKE approximately. Equipped with this algorithm, the Yau-Yau filter can be implemented by an offline stage for the training of a solver for the approximate solution of FKE and an online stage for its execution. Results of three examples indicate that this implementation is accurate, both time-efficient and storage-efficient for online computation, and is superior than existing nonlinear filtering methods such as extended Kalman filter and particle filter. It is capable of applications to practical nonlinear time-variant filtering problems."
2505.03239,Model reduction of nonlinear time-delay systems via ODE approximation and spectral submanifolds,['math.DS'],"['Yuan Tang', 'Mingwu Li']","Time-delay dynamical systems inherently embody infinite-dimensional dynamics, thereby amplifying their complexity. This aspect is especially notable in nonlinear dynamical systems, which frequently defy analytical solutions and necessitate approximations or numerical methods. These requirements present considerable challenges for the real-time simulation and analysis of their nonlinear dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a model reduction framework for nonlinear time-delay systems using spectral submanifolds (SSMs). We first approximate the time-delay systems as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) without delay and then compute the SSMs and their associated reduced-order models (ROMs) of the ODE approximations. These SSM-based ROMs successfully predict the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the time-delay systems, including free and forced vibrations, and accurately identify critical features such as isolated branches in the forced response curves and bifurcations of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits. The efficiency and accuracy of the ROMs are demonstrated through examples of increasing complexity."

Applied to systems such as the transport equation with source term, non-homogeneous Burgers equation, and shallow water equations with non-flat bathymetry and Manning friction, this method achieves significant improvements in computational efficiency and accuracy compared to previous time-averaging techniques. A theoretical result justifying the use of well-balanced Full-Order Models (FOMs) is presented. Numerical experiments validate the approach, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the question of prediction of solutions for systems that depend on some physical parameters is also addressed, and a sensitivity analysis on POD parameters confirms the model's robustness and efficiency in this case."

2505.03225,Optimal Abort Policy for Mission-Critical Systems under Imperfect Condition Monitoring,['math.OC'],"['Qiuzhuang Sun', 'Jiawen Hu', 'Zhi-Sheng Ye']","While most on-demand mission-critical systems are engineered to be reliable to support critical tasks, occasional failures may still occur during missions. To increase system survivability, a common practice is to abort the mission before an imminent failure. We consider optimal mission abort for a system whose deterioration follows a general three-state (normal, defective, failed) semi-Markov chain. The failure is assumed self-revealed, while the healthy and defective states have to be {inferred} from imperfect condition monitoring data. Due to the non-Markovian process dynamics, optimal mission abort for this partially observable system is an intractable stopping problem. For a tractable solution, we introduce a novel tool of Erlang mixtures to approximate non-exponential sojourn times in the semi-Markov chain. This allows us to approximate the original process by a surrogate continuous-time Markov chain whose optimal control policy can be solved through a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We show that the POMDP optimal policies converge almost surely to the optimal abort decision rules when the Erlang rate parameter diverges. This implies that the expected cost by adopting the POMDP solution converges to the optimal expected cost. Next, we provide comprehensive structural results on the optimal policy of the surrogate POMDP. Based on the results, we develop a modified point-based value iteration algorithm to numerically solve the surrogate POMDP. We further consider mission abort in a multi-task setting where a system executes several tasks consecutively before a thorough inspection. Through a case study on an unmanned aerial vehicle, we demonstrate the capability of real-time implementation of our model, even when the condition-monitoring signals are generated with high frequency."

2505.03222,A Stochastic Gradient Descent Method for Globally Minimizing Nearly Convex Functions,['math.OC'],"['Chenglong Bao', 'Liang Chen', 'Weizhi Shao']","This paper proposes a stochastic gradient descent method with an adaptive Gaussian noise term for the global minimization of nearly convex functions, which are nonconvex and possess multiple strict local minimizers. The noise term, independent of the gradient, is determined by the difference between the current function value and a lower bound estimate of the optimal value. In both probability space and state space, we show that the proposed algorithm converges linearly to a neighborhood of the global optimal solution. The size of this neighborhood depends on the variance of the gradient and the deviation between the estimated lower bound and the optimal value. In particular, when full gradient information is available and a sharp lower bound of the objective function is provided, the algorithm achieves linear convergence to the global optimum. Furthermore, we introduce a double-loop scheme that alternately updates the lower bound estimate and the optimization sequence, enabling convergence to a neighborhood of the global optimum that depends solely on the gradient variance. Numerical experiments on several benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

We refer to this integral as the Sinc transform.

2505.03211,Noise sensitivity and variance lower bound for minimal left-right crossing of a square in first-passage percolation,['math.PR'],"['Barbara Dembin', 'Dor Elboim']","We study first-passage percolation on $\mathbb Z ^2$ with independent and identically distributed weights, whose common distribution is uniform on $\{a,b\}$ with $0<a<b<\infty $.
  Following Ahlberg and De la Riva, we consider the passage time $τ(n,k)$ of the minimal left-right crossing of the square $[0,n]^2$, whose vertical fluctuations are bounded by $k$. We prove that when $k\le n^{1/2-ε}$, the event that $τ(n,k)$ is larger than its median is noise sensitive. This improves the main result of Ahlberg and De la Riva which holds when $k\le n^{1/22-ε}$.
  Under the additional assumption that the limit shape is not a polygon with a small number of sides, we extend the result to all $k\le n^{1-ε}$. This extension follows unconditionally when $a$ and $b$ are sufficiently close.
  Under a stronger curvature assumption, we extend the result to all $k\le n$. This in particular captures the noise sensitivity of the event that the minimal left-right crossing $T_n=τ(n,n)$ is larger than its median.
  Finally, under the curvature assumption, our methods give a lower bound of $n^{1/4-ε}$ for the variance of the passage time $T_n$ of the minimal left-right crossing of the square. We prove the last bound also for absolutely continuous weight distributions, generalizing a result of Damron--Houdré--Özdemir, which holds only for the exponential distribution.
  Our approach differs from the previous works mentioned above; the key idea is to establish a small ball probability estimate in the tail by perturbing the weights for tail events using a Mermin--Wagner type estimate."
2505.03210,Weighted Birkhoff averages: Deterministic and probabilistic perspectives,['math.DS'],"['Zhicheng Tong', 'Yong Li']","In this paper, we survey physically related applications of a class of weighted quasi-Monte Carlo methods from a theoretical, deterministic perspective, and establish quantitative universal rapid convergence results via various regularity assumptions. Specifically, we introduce weighting with compact support to the Birkhoff ergodic averages of quasi-periodic, almost periodic, and periodic systems, thereby achieving universal rapid convergence, including both arbitrary polynomial and exponential types. This is in stark contrast to the typically slow convergence in classical ergodic theory. As new contributions, we not only discuss more general weighting functions but also provide quantitative improvements to existing results; the explicit regularity settings facilitate the application of these methods to specific problems. We also revisit the physically related problems and, for the first time, establish universal exponential convergence results for the weighted computation of Fourier coefficients, in both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional cases. In addition to the above, we explore results from a probabilistic perspective, including the weighted strong law of large numbers and the weighted central limit theorem, by building upon the historical results."

Finally, we use the $W$-entropy to study the logarithmic Sobolev inequality with optimal constant on super Ricci flows on metric measure spaces."

This interplay between $\mathcal{C}$ and its complement $\mathcal{C}^c$ raises interesting questions about the delicate balance between the two, particularly in how it influences the ``size'' of $\mathcal{C}^c-\mathcal{C}$. One of our main results indicates that the Lebesgue measure of $\mathcal{C}^c-\mathcal{C}$ has a greatest lower bound of $\frac{3}{2}$."
2505.03168,Approximation of Markov Chain Expectations and the Key Role of Stationary Distribution Convergence,['math.PR'],"['Peter W. Glynn', 'Zeyu Zheng']","Consider a sequence $P_n$ of positive recurrent transition matrices or kernels that approximate a limiting infinite state matrix or kernel $P_{\infty}$. Such approximations arise naturally when one truncates an infinite state Markov chain and replaces it with a finite state approximation. It also describes the situation in which $P_{\infty}$ is a simplified limiting approximation to $P_n$ when $n$ is large. In both settings, it is often verified that the approximation $P_n$ has the characteristic that its stationary distribution $π_n$ converges to the stationary distribution $π_{\infty}$ associated with the limit. In this paper, we show that when the state space is countably infinite, this stationary distribution convergence implies that $P_n^m$ can be approximated uniformly in $m$ by $P_{\infty}^m$ when n is large. We show that this ability to approximate the marginal distributions at all time scales $m$ fails in continuous state space, but is valid when the convergence is in total variation or when we have weak convergence and the kernels are suitably Lipschitz. When the state space is discrete (as in the truncation setting), we further show that stationary distribution convergence also implies that all the expectations that are computable via first transition analysis (e.g. mean hitting times, expected infinite horizon discounted rewards) converge to those associated with the limit $P_{\infty}$. Simply put, we show that once one has established stationary distribution convergence, one immediately can infer convergence for a huge range of other expectations."

In particular, we study the case where the expansion of $γ+1$ is periodic. Under certain assumptions, the base satisfies algebraic properties. We compute the bounds for the norms of the nontrivial Galois conjugates associated with the base; thereby, extending the results of Solomyak on the classical beta expansions."
2505.03157,A Regeneration-based a Posteriori Error Bound for a Markov Chain Stationary Distribution Truncation Algorithm,"['math.PR', 'math.NA']","['Peter W. Glynn', 'Zeyu Zheng']","When the state space of a discrete state space positive recurrent Markov chain is infinite or very large, it becomes necessary to truncate the state space in order to facilitate numerical computation of the stationary distribution. This paper develops a new approach for bounding the truncation error that arises when computing approximations to the stationary distribution. This rigorous a posteriori error bound exploits the regenerative structure of the chain and assumes knowledge of a Lyapunov function. Because the bound is a posteriori (and leverages the computations done to calculate the stationary distribution itself), it tends to be much tighter than a priori bounds. The bound decomposes the regenerative cycle into a random number of excursions from a set $K$ defined in terms of the Lyapunov function into the complement of the truncation set $A$. The bound can be easily computed, and does not (for example) involve a linear program, as do some other error bounds."

For any finite covering space we define a ``polynomial functor'' from the category of topological spaces to itself. If the covering space is a closed manifold we obtain an operation defined on the bordism of any $E_\infty$-space. A certain sequence of operations called squaring operations are defined from two-fold coverings; they satisfy the Cartan formula and also a generalization of the Adem relations that is formulated by using Lubin's theory of isogenies of formal group laws. We call a ring equipped with such a sequence of squaring operations a D-ring, and observe that the bordism ring of any free $E_\infty$-space is free as a D-ring. In particular, the bordism ring of finite covering manifolds is the free D-ring on one generator. In a second compte-rendu we discuss the (Nishida) relations between the Landweber-Novikov and the Dyer-Lashof operations, and show how to represent the Dyer-Lashof operations in terms of their actions on the characteristic numbers of manifolds."

This assumption is inaccurate because the energy spectrum of an X-ray beam in a typical CT scanner is wide. At the same time, the X-ray attenuation coefficient of most materials is energy-dependent, and this dependence varies among materials. Thus, reconstruction from X-ray CT data is a nonlinear problem. If the nonlinear nature of CT data is ignored and a conventional linear reconstruction formula is used, which is frequently the case, the resulting image contains beam-hardening artifacts such as streaks. In this work, we describe the nonlinearity of CT data using the conventional model accepted by all CT practitioners. Our main result is the characterization of streak artifacts caused by nonlinearity. We also obtain an explicit expression for the leading singular behavior of the artifacts. Finally, a numerical experiment is conducted to validate the theoretical results."

More specifically, we control the spectrum of the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$ at a localized solution $\tilde{u}$, enclosing both the eigenvalues and the essential spectrum. Our approach is computer-assisted and is based on a controlled approximation of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$ by its Fourier coefficients counterpart on a bounded domain $Ω_d = (-d,d)^m$. We first control the spectrum of the Fourier coefficients operator combining a pseudo-diagonalization and a generalized Gershgorin disk theorem. Then, deriving explicit estimates between the problem on $Ω_d$ and the one on $\mathbb{R}^m$, we construct disks in the complex plane enclosing the eigenvalues of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Using computer-assisted analysis, the localization of the spectrum is made rigorous and fully explicit. We present applications to the establishment of stability for localized solutions in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE, in the planar Gray-Scott model and in the capillary-gravity Whitham equation."

The layer potentials are expressed in terms of a doubly-periodic and non-harmonic Green's function that can be explicitly written in terms of the Jacobi theta function or a modified Weierstrass sigma function. Extending results for finitely-connected Euclidean domains, we prove that the single- and double-layer potential operators are compact linear operators and derive relevant limiting properties at the boundary. We show that when the boundary has more than one connected component, the Fredholm operator of the second kind associated with the double-layer potential operator has a non-trivial null space, which can be explicitly constructed. Finally, we apply our developed theory to obtain solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems, as well as the Steklov eigenvalue problem. We implement the developed methods using Nyström discretization and find approximate solutions for these problems in several numerical examples. Our method avoids a lattice sum of the free space Green's function, is shown to be spectrally convergent, and has a faster convergence rate than the method of particular solutions for problems on tori with irregularly shaped holes."
2505.03070,Selmer stability in families of congruent Galois representations,['math.NT'],['Anwesh Ray'],"In this article I study the variation of Selmer groups in families of modular Galois representations that are congruent modulo a fixed prime $p \geq 5$. Motivated by analogies with Goldfeld's conjecture on ranks in quadratic twist families of elliptic curves, I investigate the stability of Selmer groups defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ via Greenberg's local conditions under congruences of residual Galois representations. Let $X$ be a positive real number. Fix a residual representation $\barρ$ and a corresponding modular form $f$ of weight $2$ and optimal level. I count the number of level-raising modular forms $g$ of weight $2$ that are congruent to $f$ modulo $p$, with level $N_g\leq X$, such that the $p$-rank of the Selmer groups of $g$ equals that of $f$. Under some mild assumptions on $\barρ$, I prove that this count grows at least as fast as $X (\log X)^{α- 1}$ as $X \to \infty$, for an explicit constant $α> 0$. The main result is a partial generalization of theorems of Ono and Skinner on rank-zero quadratic twists to the setting of modular forms and Selmer groups."

Our major contributions are threefold. First, we derive interpolation-based first-order optimality conditions for the linear quadratic-output $\mathcal{H}_2$ minimization problem. These conditions correspond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order linear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the Meier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation data, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation conditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model matrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this projection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces a reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory optimality conditions. The method only requires solving shifted linear systems and matrix-vector products, thus making it suitable for large-scale problems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

This includes, in particular, the inexact proximal point method (IPPm), extragradient method (EGm), and sharpness-aware minimization (SAMm). Asymptotic convergence properies of IGDm are established under both global and local assumptions on objective functions with providing constructive convergence rates depending on the Polyak-Łojasiewicz-Kurdyka (PLK) conditions for the objective function. Global convergence of EGm and SAMm for general smooth functions and of IPPM for weakly convex functions is derived in this way. Moreover, local convergence properties of EGm and SAMm for locally smooth functions as well as of IPPm for prox-regular functions are established. Numerical experiments for derivative-free optimization problems are conducted to confirm the efficiency of the momentum effects of the developed methods under inexactness of gradient computations"

2505.02992,On the Euler-Poisson equations with variable background states and nonlocal velocity alignment,['math.AP'],"['Kunhui Luan', 'Changhui Tan', 'Qiyu Wu']","We study the 1D pressureless Euler-Poisson equations with variable background states and nonlocal velocity alignment. Our main focus is the phenomenon of critical thresholds, where subcritical initial data lead to global regularity, while supercritical data result in finite-time singularity formation. The critical threshold behavior of the Euler-Poisson-alignment (EPA) system has previously been investigated under two specific setups: (1) when the background state is constant, phase plane analysis was used in the work of Bhatnagar, Liu and Tan [J. Differ. Equ. 375 (2023) 82-119] to establish critical thresholds; and (2) when the nonlocal alignment is replaced by linear damping, comparison principles based on Lyapunov functions were employed in the work of Choi, Kim, Koo and Tadmor [arXiv:2402.12839].
  In this work, we present a comprehensive critical threshold analysis of the general EPA system, incorporating both nonlocal effects. Our framework unifies the techniques developed in the aforementioned studies and recovers their results under the respective limiting assumptions. A key feature of our approach is the oscillatory nature of the solution, which motivates a decomposition of the phase plane into four distinct regions. In each region, we implement tailored comparison principles to construct the critical thresholds piece by piece."

Analyzing its asymptotic decay yields a clean, self-contained proof that the expected number of collisions in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is finite if and only if $d\geq3$. We also provide a general formula for the asymptotic number of collisions."

Macqueron']","Unlike traditional model-based reinforcement learning approaches that extract the underlying system structure by estimating parameters from data, non-model-based data-driven control learns the optimal policy directly from input-state data without any intermediate model identification. Although this direct reinforcement learning approach offers increased adaptability and resilience to model misspecification, its reliance on raw data leaves it vulnerable to system noise and disturbances that may undermine convergence, robustness, and stability. In this article, we establish the convergence, robustness, and stability of value iteration (VI) for data-driven control of stochastic linear quadratic (LQ) systems in discrete-time with entirely unknown dynamics and cost. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we prove that VI is globally exponentially stable for any positive semidefinite initial value matrix in noise-free settings, thereby significantly relaxing restrictive assumptions on initial value functions in existing literature. Second, we extend our analysis to scenarios with external disturbances, proving that VI maintains small-disturbance input-to-state stability (ISS) and converges within a small neighborhood of the optimal solution when disturbances are sufficiently small. Third, we propose a new non-model-based robust adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm for adaptive optimal controller design, which, unlike existing procedures, requires no prior knowledge of an initial admissible control policy. Numerical experiments on a ``data center cooling'' problem demonstrate the convergence and stability of the algorithm compared to established methods, highlighting its robustness and adaptability for data-driven control in noisy environments. Finally, we present a fully data-driven solution to dynamic portfolio allocation, an important problem in quantitative finance."

Stochastic oscillators require new definitions of asymptotic phase. The $Q$-function, i.e. the slowest decaying complex mode of the stochastic Koopman operator (SKO), was proposed as a means of phase reduction for stochastic oscillators. In this paper, we show that the $Q$-function approach also leads to a novel definition of ``synchronization"" for coupled stochastic oscillators. A system of coupled oscillators in the synchronous regime may be viewed as a single (higher-dimensional) oscillator. Therefore, we investigate the relation between the $Q$-functions of the uncoupled oscillators and the higher-dimensional $Q$-function for the coupled system. We propose a definition of synchronization between coupled stochastic oscillators in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum of Kolmogorov's backward operator (the generator of the Markov process, or the SKO) of the higher dimensional coupled system. We observe a novel type of bifurcation reflecting (i) the relationship between the leading eigenvalues of the SKO for the coupled system and (ii) qualitative changes in the cross-spectral density of the coupled oscillators. Using our proposed definition, we observe synchronization domains for symmetrically-coupled stochastic oscillators that are analogous to Arnold tongues for coupled deterministic oscillators."

The theoretical framework for error estimation is based on the variational multiscale (VMS) concept, where the solution is decomposed into resolved (finite element) and unresolved (sub-grid) scales. In this work, we propose an orthogonal sub-grid scale (OSGS) method for a goal-oriented error estimation in VMS discretizations. In the OSGS approach, the space of the sub-grid scales (SGSs) is orthogonal to the finite element space. The error is estimated in the quantity of interest, given by the linear functional $Q(u)$ of the unknown $u$. If the SGS $u'$ is estimated, the error in the quantity of interest can be approximated by $Q(u')$. Our approach is compared with a duality-based a posteriori error estimation method, which requires the solution of an additional auxiliary problem. The results indicate that both methods yield similar error estimates, whereas the VMS-based explicit approach is computationally less expensive than the duality-based implicit approach. Numerical tests demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed error estimation techniques in terms of the quantity of interest functionals."

This extends the celebrated work of Kazhdan and Lusztig, who gave a $K$-theoretic realization of affine Hecke algebras with equal parameters, and complements results of Kato, who extended this construction to the three-parameter affine Hecke algebra of type $C$. A key idea behind our new construction is to exploit the reducibility of the adjoint representation in small characteristic. We also show that under suitable geometric conditions, our construction leads to a Deligne-Langlands style classification of simple modules. We verify these geometric conditions for $G_2$ thereby obtaining a full geometric classification of the simple modules for the affine Hecke algebra of $G_2$ with two parameters away from roots of unities."

Building on an earlier work by Ikeda, Iwao, and Maeno, we present an explicit algebraic realization of the $K$-Peterson map via a rational substitution that sends the generators of the quantum $K$-theory ring to explicit rational expressions in the fundamental generators of $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$, thereby matching the Schubert bases on both sides. Our approach builds on recent developments in the theory of $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki, as well as the theory of $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions introduced by Ikeda, Shimozono, and Yamaguchi.

The algebra generated by $W_i(z)$ can be regarded as a $q$-deformation of the direct sum $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$, where $\mathsf{F}$ denotes the free fermion algebra and $\mathsf{SVir}$ stands for the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra, also referred to as the $N=1$ superconformal algebra or the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebra. Moreover, the generators $W_i(z)$ admit two screening currents, and we show that their degeneration limits coincide with the screening currents of $\mathsf{SVir}$.

A recent result of Steiner (2024), shows that every Schriver graph, and thus every Kneser graph, satisfies the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture, that is, it contains $K_{χ(G)}$ as an odd minor. We strengthen these results for Kneser graphs in two ways. We show that for every $t\ge 8$, there are $t$-chromatic Kneser graphs that contain arbitrarily large complete totally odd subdivisions (and thus, odd minors). We also show that every Kneser graph contains a totally odd subdivision of $K_{χ(G)}$.
  Kneser graphs are the prime example of graphs having chromatic number equal to its topological lower bounds. Motivated by our main results, we also study totally odd immersions on graphs with this property, proving, in particular, that if the chromatic number of $G$ is equal to any of its topological lower bounds, then $G$ contains a totally odd immersion of $K_{\lfloor χ(G)/2 \rfloor +1}$.

Recently, they have been applied to persistent homology, by embedding barcodes into spaces of paths.

Here we address this by proposing a discrete alternative. The critical points of a persistence landscape form a time-series, of which we compute the discrete signature. We call this association the discrete landscape feature map (DLFM). We give results on the injectivity, stability and computability of the DLFM.

2505.02783,The $H^\infty$-functional calculus for right slice hyperholomorphic functions and right linear Clifford operators,['math.SP'],"['Fabrizio Colombo', 'Francesco Mantovani', 'Peter Schlosser']","In 2016, the spectral theory on the $S$-spectrum was used to establish the $H^\infty$-functional calculus for quaternionic or Clifford operators. This calculus applies for example to sectorial or bisectorial right linear operators $T$ and left slice hyperholomorphic functions $f$ that can grow as polynomials. It relies on the product of the two operators $e(T)^{-1}$ and $(ef)(T)$, both defined via some underlying $S$-functional calculus (also called $ω$-functional calculus). For left slice holomorphic functions $f$ this definition does not depend on the choice of the regularizer function $e$. However, due to the non-commutative multiplication of Clifford numbers, it was unclear how to extend this definition to right slice hyperholomorphic functions. This paper addresses this significant unresolved issue and shows how right linear operators can possess the $H^\infty$-functional calculus also for right slice hyperholomorphic functions."
2505.02782,Unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials and of uniformly bounded functions in $L^p$ spaces,"['math.CA', 'math.FA']","['Nir Lev', 'Anton Tselishchev']","It is known that there is no unconditional basis of exponentials in the space $L^p(Ω)$, $p \ne 2$, for any set $Ω\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of finite measure. This is a consequence of a more general result due to Gaposhkin, who proved that the space $L^p(Ω)$ does not admit a seminormalized unconditional basis consisting of uniformly bounded functions. We show that the latter result fails if the word ""basis"" is replaced with ""Schauder frame"". On the other hand we prove that if $Ω$ has nonempty interior then there are no unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials in the space $L^p(Ω)$, $p \ne 2$."

Let ${\bf E}/{\bf F}$ be a finite cyclic extension of number fields, of degree $d$, and $\mathfrak{K}$ be a character of $\mathbb{A}_{\bf F}^\times$ whose kernel is ${\bf F}^\times \mathrm{N}_{{\bf E}/{\bf F}}(\mathbb{A}_{\bf E}^\times)$. We prove that every automorphic discrete representation of $\mathrm{GL}_m(\mathbb{A}_{\bf E})$ has a (strong) $\mathfrak{K}$-lift to $\mathrm{GL}_{md}(\mathbb{A}_{\bf F})$, i.e. compatible with the local lifting maps.

With this, we define and study a filtered (weighted) variant of the Euler characteristic and show this is a `filtered homotopy invariant'. We then go on to use the recent work of Biran, Cornea and Zhang by considering a persistence Spanier-Whitehead category of filtered CW complexes and show this is a triangulated persistence category and discuss the fragmentation metrics induced by this structure. We go on to show that the K-group of this persistence category is isomorphic to the ring of Novikov polynomials and this isomorphism is induced by the weighted Euler characteristic. Finally, we discuss how these constructions extend to a filtered stable homotopy category and its relation to filtered/persistence homologies."

We also present the explicit lower and upper bounds for the sharp stability constants and compute their exact limits when the dimension $N\rightarrow\infty$. Our proofs rely on spherical harmonics decomposition and Fourier analysis, differing significantly from existing approaches in the literature. Our results substantially improve the stability constants of the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle recently obtained in [26]. As direct consequences of our main results, we also establish the sharp stability, with exact asymptotic behavior of the stability constants, of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with curl-free vector fields and a sharp version of the second order Poincaré type inequality with Gaussian measure."

More precisely, we consider $Ω_r = Ω_0 \setminus \overline{B}_r$, where $Ω_0 \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, $n \geq 2$, is an open, bounded set with a Lipschitz boundary, and $B_r$ is the ball centered at the origin with radius $r > 0$, such that $\overline{B}_r \subset Ω_0$. In the first part of the paper, we focus on the first Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue $σ_1(Ω_r)$ and prove that the sequence of corresponding normalized eigenfunctions converges to a particular constant as $r \to 0^+$. This will allow us to prove an isoperimetric inequality for $ σ_1(Ω_r)$ when $r$ is small enough, under a measure constraint. The second part is focused on the second Steklov-Dirichlet eigenvalue $σ_2(Ω_r)$. We prove that it converges to the first non-trivial Steklov eigenvalue $\overlineσ_1(Ω_0)$ of the non-perforated domain $Ω_0$. This result, together with the Brock and Weinstock inequalities, respectively, allows us to prove two isoperimetric inequalities for small holes."

Skein exact triangles are established, and using an eigenspace decomposition arising from operators associated to the edges, it is shown that the dimension of the SU(3) homology counts Tait colorings when the web is planar. Unlike the SO(3) case, the SU(3) homology is mod-2 graded. Its Euler characteristic can be interpreted as a signed count of Tait colorings, or equivalently as the value at 1 of the Yamada polynomial invariant. Some examples and variants of the construction are also discussed."

One way to solve the equation $A \in \mathcal{A}$ is by applying Lagrange's method which was introduced over 200 years ago. In this paper, we consider a self-defined Diophantine equation $A \in \mathcal{A}$, which we called the $LA2$-type equation, motivated by results of Teckan, Özkoç, Fenolahy, Ramanantsoa and Totohasina. We provide some properties of $LA2$-type equations, and determine the set of integer solutions of equation $A \in \mathcal{Z}(1)$, where $\mathcal{Z}(1)$ is the set of all $LA2$-type equations such that $A$ can be rewrite as Pell's equation $\tilde{u} - τ\tilde{v}^2 = 1$. In addition, we show that there exist positive integers $M'_l$, $l = 1,2,3,4$ such that for any $x \in \mathbb{R}, x \geq \mathcal{L} := \max\{M'_l: l \in \{1,2,3,4\}\}$, the formula of the number of pairwise integer solutions to the equation $A \in \mathcal{Z}(1)$ in the region enclosed by the equation $|u| + |v| \leq x$ in the $uv$ plane, can be determined and proved.

2505.02729,Computing the Congestion Phases of Dynamical Systems with Priorities and Application to Emergency Departments,['math.OC'],"['Xavier Allamigeon', 'Pascal Capetillo', 'Stéphane Gaubert']","Medical emergency departments are complex systems in which patients must be treated according to priority rules based on the severity of their condition. We develop a model of emergency departments using Petri nets with priorities, described by nonmonotone piecewise linear dynamical systems. The collection of stationary solutions of such systems forms a ""phase diagram"", in which each phase corresponds to a subset of bottleneck resources (like senior doctors, interns, nurses, consultation rooms, etc.). Since the number of phases is generally exponential in the number of resources, developing automated methods is essential to tackle realistic models. We develop a general method to compute congestion diagrams. A key ingredient is a polynomial time algorithm to test whether a given ""policy"" (configuration of bottleneck tasks) is achievable by a choice of resources. This is done by reduction to a feasibility problem for an unusual class of lexicographic polyhedra. Furthermore, we show that each policy uniquely determines the system's throughput. We apply our approach to a case study, analyzing a simplified model of an emergency department from Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris."

This construction generalizes both Balmer's tensor triangular spectra and Matsui's triangular spectra, and provides a unified framework for classifying thick submodules. We establish its fundamental properties, including universality, comparison with existing spectra, and descent, and construct a natural morphism to the Balmer spectrum of the base. Applications show that the relative Matsui spectrum recovers the underlying classical geometric spaces from categorical data in various settings: categories of perfect complexes of schemes, twisted derived categories, categories of singularities, and derived matrix factorization categories. Thus the relative Matsui spectrum extends the reach of tensor triangular geometry beyond globally tensorial settings, while preserving geometric intuition."

We study the separation distances between roots of $f_n$ and prove that the set of these distances, normalized by $n^{-5/4}$, converges in distribution as $n\to \infty$ to a non-homogeneous Poisson point process. As a corollary, we deduce that the minimal separation distance between roots of $f_n$, normalized by $n^{-5/4}$ has a non-trivial limit law. In the course of the proof, we establish a related result which may be of independent interest: a Taylor series with random i.i.d. coefficients almost-surely does not have a double zero anywhere other than the origin."

We then establish a corresponding multiplicative splitting formula for derived pushforwards of $N_{\infty}$ ring spectra. Just as the usual tom Dieck splitting characterizes the equivariant stable category associated to an $N_{\infty}$ operad $\mathcal{N}$, the multiplicative tom Dieck splitting characterizes the $G$-symmetric monoidal structure on the genuine equivariant stable category associated to $\mathcal{N}$."

2505.02700,Cut elimination for a non-wellfounded system for the master modality,['math.LO'],"['Borja Sierra Miranda', 'Thomas Studer']","In previous work we provided a method for eliminating cuts in non-wellfounded proofs with a local-progress condition, these being the simplest kind of non-wellfounded proofs. The method consisted of splitting the proof into nicely behaved fragments. This paper extends our method to proofs based on simple trace conditions. The main idea is to split the system with the trace condition into infinitely many local-progress calculi that together are equivalent to the original trace-based system. This provides a cut elimination method using only basic tools of structural proof theory and corecursion, which is needed due to the non-wellfounded character of proofs. We will employ the method to obtain syntactic cut elimination for $K^+$, a system of modal logic with the master modality."
2505.02697,Uniformization of metric surfaces: A survey,"['math.CV', 'math.GT', 'math.MG']",['Dimitrios Ntalampekos'],"In this survey we present the most recent developments in the uniformization of metric surfaces, i.e., metric spaces homeomorphic to two-dimensional topological manifolds. We start from the classical conformal uniformization theorem of Koebe and Poincaré. Then we discuss the Bonk-Kleiner theorem on the quasisymmetric uniformization of metric spheres, which marks the beginning of the study of the uniformization problem on fractal surfaces. The next result presented is Rajala's theorem on the quasiconformal uniformization of metric spheres. We conclude with the final result in this series of works, due to Romney and the author, on the weakly quasiconformal uniformization of arbitrary metric surfaces of locally finite area under no further assumption."
2505.02688,Batch Sample-wise Stochastic Optimal Control via Stochastic Maximum Principle,['math.OC'],"['Hui Sun', 'Feng Bao']","In this work, we study the stochastic optimal control problem (SOC) mainly from the probabilistic view point, i.e. via the Stochastic Maximum principle (SMP) \cite{Peng4}. We adopt the sample-wise backpropagation scheme proposed in \cite{Hui1} to solve the SOC problem under the strong convexity assumption. Importantly, in the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) procedure, we use batch samples with higher order scheme in the forward SDE to improve the convergence rate in \cite{Hui1} from $\sim \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{N}{K} + \frac{1}{N}})$ to $\sim \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{K} + \frac{1}{N^2}})$ and note that the main source of uncertainty originates from the scheme for the simulation of $Z$ term in the BSDE. In the meantime, we note the SGD procedure uses only the necessary condition of the SMP, while the batch simulation of the approximating solution of BSDEs allows one to obtain a more accurate estimate of the control $u$ that minimizes the Hamiltonian. We then propose a damped contraction algorithm to solve the SOC problem whose proof of convergence for a special case is attained under some appropriate assumption. We then show numerical results to check the first order convergence rate of the projection algorithm and analyze the convergence behavior of the damped contraction algorithm. Lastly, we briefly discuss how to incorporate the proposed scheme in solving practical problems especially when the Randomized Neural Networks are used. We note that in this special case, the error backward propagation can be avoided and parameter update can be achieved via purely algebraic computation (vector algebra) which will potentially improve the efficiency of the whole training procedure. Such idea will require further exploration and we will leave it as our future work."
2505.02685,On the Spectral Expansion of Monotone Subsets of the Hypercube,"['math.PR', 'math.CO']","['Yumou Fei', 'Renato Ferreira Pinto Jr']","We study the spectral gap of subgraphs of the hypercube induced by monotone subsets of vertices. For a monotone subset $A\subseteq\{0,1\}^{n}$ of density $μ(A)$, the previous best lower bound on the spectral gap, due to Cohen, was $γ\gtrsim μ(A)/n^{2}$, improving upon the earlier bound $γ\gtrsim μ(A)^{2}/n^{2}$ established by Ding and Mossel. In this paper, we prove the optimal lower bound $γ\gtrsim μ(A)/n$. As a corollary, we improve the mixing time upper bound of the random walk on constant-density monotone sets from $O(n^{3})$, as shown by Ding and Mossel, to $O(n^{2})$. Along the way, we develop two new inequalities that may be of independent interest: (1)~a directed $L^{2}$-Poincaré inequality on the hypercube, and (2)~an ``approximate'' FKG inequality for monotone sets."
2505.02682,Certain Observations on Ideals Associated With Weighted Density Using Modulus Functions,['math.GN'],"['Pratulananda Das', 'Subhankar Das']","In this article our main object of investigation is the simple modular density ideals $\mathcal{Z}_g(f)$ introduced in [Bose et al., Indag. math., 2018] where $g$ is a weight function, more precisely, $g\in G$, $G=\{g:ω\to [0,\infty):\frac{k}{g(k)}\not\to 0 \text{ and }\:\: g(k)\to \infty \text{ as }\:\:k\to \infty \}$ and $f$ is an unbounded modulus function. We mainly investigate certain properties of these ideals in line of [Kwela et al, J. math. Anal. Appl., 2019]. For an unbounded modulus function $f$ it is shown that there are $1$ or $\ck$ many functions $g\in G$ generating the same ideal $\mathcal{Z}_g(f)$. We then obtain certain interactive results involving the sequence of submeasures $\{φ_k\}_{k\in ω}$ generating the ideal $\mathcal{Z}_g(f)$ and the functions $g,f$. Finally, we present some observations on $\mathcal{Z}_g(f)$ ideals related to the notion of increasing-invariance."
2505.02653,Hierarchical random measures without tables,"['math.ST', 'math.PR', 'stat.ME']","['Marta Catalano', 'Claudio Del Sole']","The hierarchical Dirichlet process is the cornerstone of Bayesian nonparametric multilevel models. Its generative model can be described through a set of latent variables, commonly referred to as tables within the popular restaurant franchise metaphor. The latent tables simplify the expression of the posterior and allow for the implementation of a Gibbs sampling algorithm to approximately draw samples from it. However, managing their assignments can become computationally expensive, especially as the size of the dataset and of the number of levels increase. In this work, we identify a prior for the concentration parameter of the hierarchical Dirichlet process that (i) induces a quasi-conjugate posterior distribution, and (ii) removes the need of tables, bringing to more interpretable expressions for the posterior, with both a faster and an exact algorithm to sample from it. Remarkably, this construction extends beyond the Dirichlet process, leading to a new framework for defining normalized hierarchical random measures and a new class of algorithms to sample from their posteriors. The key analytical tool is the independence of multivariate increments, that is, their representation as completely random vectors."

When multiple candidate models are considered, MA techniques can be used to weight and combine them, often resulting in improved predictive accuracy and better estimation stability compared to model selection (MS) methods. In this paper, we address two challenges in combining least squares estimators from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We first establish several oracle inequalities for least squares MA via minimizing a Mallows' $C_p$ criterion under an arbitrary candidate model set. Compared to existing studies, these oracle inequalities yield faster excess risk and directly imply the asymptotic optimality of the resulting MA estimators under milder conditions. Moreover, we consider candidate model construction and investigate the problem of optimal all-subset combination for least squares estimators, which is an important yet rarely discussed topic in the existing literature. We show that there exists a fundamental limit to achieving the optimal all-subset MA risk. To attain this limit, we propose a novel Mallows-type MA procedure based on a dimension-adaptive $C_p$ criterion. The implicit ensembling effects of several MS procedures are also revealed and discussed. We conduct several numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Mallows-type MA estimator."
2505.02636,Phase retrieval and matrix sensing via benign and overparametrized nonconvex optimization,"['math.OC', 'math.ST']",['Andrew D. McRae'],"We study a nonconvex optimization algorithmic approach to phase retrieval and the more general problem of semidefinite low-rank matrix sensing. Specifically, we analyze the nonconvex landscape of a quartic Burer-Monteiro factored least-squares optimization problem. We develop a new analysis framework, taking advantage of the semidefinite problem structure, to understand the properties of second-order critical points -- specifically, whether they (approximately) recover the ground truth matrix. We show that it can be helpful to (mildly) overparametrize the problem, that is, to optimize over matrices of higher rank than the ground truth. We then apply this framework to several well-studied problem instances: in addition to recovering existing state-of-the-art phase retrieval landscape guarantees (without overparametrization), we show that overparametrizing by a factor at most logarithmic in the dimension allows recovery with optimal statistical sample complexity and error for the problems of (1) phase retrieval with sub-Gaussian measurements and (2) more general semidefinite matrix sensing with rank-1 Gaussian measurements. Previously, such statistical results had been shown only for estimators based on semidefinite programming. More generally, our analysis is partially based on the powerful method of convex dual certificates, suggesting that it could be applied to a much wider class of problems."

Along the way, we strengthen the bound for $\ell_1$-norm implicit bias, obtain sublinear and linear convergence results, and generalize the convergence result to arbitrary convex $L$-smooth functions. We also propose an alternative method that avoids exponentiation, resembling the original Hadamard descent, but with provable convergence."

Among the various areas in which such problems occur, we would like to mention in particular the recovery of sparse signals. We propose an adaptive double-proximal, full-splitting algorithm with a moving center approach in the final subproblem, which addresses the challenge of evaluating compositions by decoupling the linear operator from the nonsmooth component. We establish the subsequential convergence of the generated sequence of iterates to an approximate stationary point and prove its global convergence under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property. We also discuss the tightness of the convergence results and provide insights into the rationale for seeking an approximate KKT point. This is illustrated by constructing a counterexample showing that the algorithm can diverge when seeking exact solutions. Finally, we present a practical version of the algorithm that incorporates a nonmonotone line search, which significantly improves the convergence performance."

2505.02575,Lipschitz upper semicontinuity of linear inequality systems under full perturbations,['math.OC'],"['Jesús Camacho', 'María Josefa Cánovas', 'Helmut Gfrerer', 'Juan Parra']","The present paper is focused on the computation of the Lipschitz upper semicontinuity modulus of the feasible set mapping in the context of fully perturbed linear inequality systems; i.e., where all coefficients are allowed to be perturbed. The direct antecedent comes from the framework of right-hand side (RHS, for short) perturbations. The difference between both parametric contexts, full vs RHS perturbations, is emphasized. In particular, the polyhedral structure of the graph of the feasible set mapping in the latter framework enables us to apply classical results as those of Hoffman [A. J. HOFFMAN, J. Res. Natl. Bur. Stand. 49 (1952), pp. 263--265] and Robinson [S. M. ROBINSON, Math. Progr. Study 14 (1981), pp. 206--214]. In contrast, the graph of the feasible set mapping under full perturbations is no longer polyhedral (not even convex). This fact requires ad hoc techniques to analyze the Lipschitz upper semicontinuity property and its corresponding modulus."
2505.02564,Bounded diameter variations of Ryser's conjecture,['math.CO'],"['Andras Gyarfas', 'Gabor N. Sarkozy']","In this paper we study bounded diameter variations of the following form of Ryser's conjecture. For every graph $G=(V,E)$ with independence number $α(G)=α$ and integer $r\geq 2$, in every $r$-edge coloring of $G$ there is a cover of $V(G)$ by the vertices of $(r-1)α$ monochromatic connected components. Milićević initiated the question whether the diameters of the covering components can be bounded.
  For any graph $G$ with $α(G)=2$ we show that in every 2-coloring of the edges, $V(G)$ can be covered by the vertices of two monochromatic subgraphs of diameter at most 4. This improves a result of DeBiasio et al., which in turn improved a result of Milićević. It remains open whether diameter $4$ can be strengthened to diameter $3$, we could do this only for certain graphs, including odd antiholes.
  We propose also a somewhat orthogonal aspect of the problem. Suppose that we fix the diameter $d$ of the monochromatic components, how many do we need to cover the vertex set? For $d=2,2\le r \le 3$, the exact answer is $rα$ and for $d=4,r=2$, we prove the upper bound $\lfloor 3α/2\rfloor$."
2505.02562,Marginal minimization and sup-norm expansions in perturbed optimization,"['math.OC', 'math.ST']",['Vladimir Spokoiny'],"Let the objective unction \( f \) depends on the target variable \( x \) along with a nuisance variable \( s \): \( f(v) = f(x,s) \). The goal is to identify the marginal solution \( x^{*} = \arg\min_{x} \min_{s} f(x,s) \). This paper discusses three related problems. The plugin approach widely used e.g. in inverse problems suggests to use a preliminary guess (pilot) \( \hat{s} \) and apply the solution of the partial optimization \( \hat{x} = \arg\min_{x} f(x,\hat{s}) \). The main question to address within this approach is the required quality of the pilot ensuring the prescribed accuracy of \( \hat{x} \). The popular \emph{alternating optimization} approach suggests the following procedure: given a starting guess \( x_{0} \), for \( t \geq 1 \), define \( s_{t} = \arg\min_{s} f(x_{t-1},s) \), and then \( x_{t} = \arg\min_{x} f(x,s_{t}) \). The main question here is the set of conditions ensuring a convergence of \( x_{t} \) to \( x^{*} \). Finally, the paper discusses an interesting connection between marginal optimization and sup-norm estimation. The basic idea is to consider one component of the variable \( v \) as a target and the rest as nuisance. In all cases, we provide accurate closed form results under realistic assumptions. The results are illustrated by one numerical example for the BTL model."
2505.02552,Operators Max L and Min U and duals of Boolean posets,['math.LO'],"['Ivan Chajda', 'Miroslav Kolařík', 'Helmut Länger']","When working with posets which are not necessarily lattices, one has a lack of lattice operations which causes problems in algebraic constructions. This is the reason why we use the operators Max L and Min U substituting infimum and supremum, respectively. We axiomatize these operators. Two more operators, namely the so-called symmetric difference and the Sheffer operator, are introduced and studied in complemented posets by using the operators Max L and Min U. In Boolean algebras, the symmetric difference is used to construct its dual structure, the corresponding unitary Boolean ring. By generalizing this idea, we assign to each Boolean poset a so-called dual and prove that also, conversely, a Boolean poset can be derived from its dual."

To do that, we expand Gödel modal logic $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G}$ with the involutive negation $\sim$ defined as $v({\sim}φ,w)=1-v(φ,w)$. We provide semantics with the finite model property for our new logic that we call $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ and show its equivalence to the standard semantics over $[0,1]$-valued Kripke models. Namely, we show that $φ$ is valid in the standard semantics of $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ iff it is valid in the new semantics. Using this new semantics, we construct a constraint tableaux calculus for $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$ that allows for an explicit extraction of countermodels from complete open branches and then employ the tableaux calculus to obtain the PSpace-completeness of the validity in $\mathbf{K}\mathsf{G_{inv}}$."

For the homogeneous set this has already been done using the notion of $α$-largeness, where $α$ is a countable ordinal equipped with a system of fundamental sequences. To extend this approach the more appropriate notion is barrier largeness. Since the complexity of barriers can be measured by countable ordinals, we define Ramsey ordinals and, using appropriate iterations of the Veblen functions, we are able to compute them."

2505.02531,A posteriori error estimates for the finite element approximation of the convection-diffusion-reaction equation based on the variational multiscale concept,['math.NA'],"['Ramon Codina', 'Hauke Gravenkamp', 'Sheraz Ahmed Khan']","In this study, we employ the variational multiscale (VMS) concept to develop a posteriori error estimates for the stationary convection-diffusion-reaction equation. The variational multiscale method is based on splitting the continuous part of the problem into a resolved scale (coarse scale) and an unresolved scale (fine scale). The unresolved scale (also known as the sub-grid scale) is modeled by choosing it proportional to the component of the residual orthogonal to the finite element space, leading to the orthogonal sub-grid scale (OSGS) method. The idea is then to use the modeled sub-grid scale as an error estimator, considering its contribution in the element interiors and on the edges. We present the results of the a priori analysis and two different strategies for the a posteriori error analysis for the OSGS method. Our proposal is to use a scaled norm of the sub-grid scales as an a posteriori error estimate in the so-called stabilized norm of the problem. This norm has control over the convective term, which is necessary for convection-dominated problems. Numerical examples show the reliable performance of the proposed error estimator compared to other error estimators belonging to the variational multiscale family."

Generalized convolutions and correlation for multiple variables, extending the conventional convolution for single-variable functions, are proposed within the QPFT setting. Additionally, a Boas-type theorem for the multidimensional QPFT is established.

Total trades were introduced recently by Ghorbani, Kamali and Khosravshahi, who showed that over a field of characteristic zero the vector space of trades decomposes into a direct sum of spaces of total trades. In this paper, we show that the vector space spanned by the permutations of a total trade is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group. As a corollary, the previous decomposition theorem is recovered. Also, a basis is obtained for the module of total trades in the spirit of Specht polynomials. More generally, in the second part of the paper we consider intersection matrices and determine the irreducible decompositions of their images. This generalizes previously known results concerning ranks of special cases."

We show that this index can be represented by an idempotent involving heat operators. The rapid decay of the kernels in the algebra used is helpful in proving convergence of pairings with cyclic cocycles. Representing the index in terms of heat operators allows one to use heat kernel asymptotics to compute such pairings.

2505.02495,An Exact Penalty Approach for Equality Constrained Optimization over a Convex Set,['math.OC'],"['Nachuan Xiao', 'Tianyun Tang', 'Shiwei Wang', 'Kim-Chuan Toh']","In this paper, we consider the nonlinear constrained optimization problem (NCP) with constraint set $\{x \in \mathcal{X}: c(x) = 0\}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is a closed convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We propose an exact penalty approach, named constraint dissolving approach, that transforms (NCP) into its corresponding constraint dissolving problem (CDP). The transformed problem (CDP) admits $\mathcal{X}$ as its feasible region with a locally Lipschitz smooth objective function. We prove that (NCP) and (CDP) share the same first-order stationary points, second-order stationary points, second-order sufficient condition (SOSC) points, and strong SOSC points, in a neighborhood of the feasible region. Moreover, we prove that these equivalences extend globally under a particular error bound condition. Therefore, our proposed constraint dissolving approach enables direct implementations of optimization approaches over $\mathcal{X}$ and inherits their convergence properties to solve problems that take the form of (NCP). Preliminary numerical experiments illustrate the high efficiency of directly applying existing solvers for optimization over $\mathcal{X}$ to solve (NCP) through (CDP). These numerical results further demonstrate the practical potential of our proposed constraint dissolving approach."

2505.02485,Integrating Column Generation and Large Neighborhood Search for Bus Driver Scheduling with Complex Break Constraints,"['math.OC', 'cs.AI']","['Lucas Kletzander', 'Tommaso Mannelli Mazzoli', 'Nysret Musliu', 'Pascal Van Hentenryck']","The Bus Driver Scheduling Problem (BDSP) is a combinatorial optimization problem with the goal to design shifts to cover prearranged bus tours. The objective takes into account the operational cost as well as the satisfaction of drivers. This problem is heavily constrained due to strict legal rules and collective agreements. The objective of this article is to provide state-of-the-art exact and hybrid solution methods that can provide high-quality solutions for instances of different sizes. This work presents a comprehensive study of both an exact method, Branch and Price (B&P), as well as a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) framework which uses B&P or Column Generation (CG) for the repair phase to solve the BDSP. It further proposes and evaluates a novel deeper integration of B&P and LNS, storing the generated columns from the LNS subproblems and reusing them for other subproblems, or to find better global solutions. The article presents a detailed analysis of several components of the solution methods and their impact, including general improvements for the B&P subproblem, which is a high-dimensional Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), and the components of the LNS. The evaluation shows that our approach provides new state-of-the-art results for instances of all sizes, including exact solutions for small instances, and low gaps to a known lower bound for mid-sized instances. Conclusions: We observe that B&P provides the best results for small instances, while the tight integration of LNS and CG can provide high-quality solutions for larger instances, further improving over LNS which just uses CG as a black box. The proposed methods are general and can also be applied to other rule sets and related optimization problems"
2505.02482,"Limits of sequences of volume preserving homeomorphisms in $W^{1,p}$, for $0<p<1$",['math.DS'],"['Assis Azevedo', 'Davide Azevedo']","Douady referred in a personal communication to Peetre that, if $0<p<1$, the canonical mapping from $W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R})$ to $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ is not injective. Peetre \cite{peetre} went further, proving that the continuous and linear function $π=(π_1,π_2):W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R})\rightarrow L^p(\mathbb{R})\times L^p(\mathbb{R})$ such that, for $f\in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, $Φ(f)=(f,f')$, is an isomorphism, showing the ``complete disconnection'' between $π_1$ and $π_2$. This means that given $g,h\in L^p(\mathbb{R})$ there exists a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of $C^1$ functions such that $\left(f_n,f_n'\right)_n$ converge to $(g,h)$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R})\times L^p(\mathbb{R})$.
  In this paper we obtain results of this type, but for homeomorphisms of an open bounded $Ω\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, that are volume preserving, in the case $d\geq 2$. The convergence of the sequences will be more restricted as we consider it in $L^\infty(Ω)\times L^p(Ω)$. As a particular case, we will show that if $SO(d)$ is the special orthogonal group and $H$ is a Riemann integrable function from $Ω$ to $SO(d)$, then there exists a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of orientation and volume preserving $C^\infty$ homeomorphisms of $Ω$ converging in $L^\infty(Ω)$ to the identity and such that $\left(Df_n\right)_n$ converges to $H$ in $L^p(Ω)^{d^2}$. The same is true if we substitute the identity function by any $f$, $C^1$ homeomorphism of $Ω$ such that $Df(x)\in SO(d)$ for all $x\inΩ$.
  In the case $d=1$, where the volume preserving condition has no interest, we will prove that a pair $(f,F)\in C^1(I)\times L^p(I)$, such that $f', (f^{-1})'\in L^r(I)$ for some $r>1$, admits a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of $C^1$ homeomorphisms converging in $L^\infty(I)$ to $f$ and such that $(f_n')_n$ converges in $L^p(I)$ to $F$, if and only if $0\leq F\leq g'$."

Our aim is to analyse the convergence of these operators as the scaling parameter tends to zero. If the scaled potential is resonant, the limit in strong resolvent sense is a Robin Laplacian with boundary coefficient expressed in terms of the mean curvature of the boundary. A counterexample shows that norm resolvent convergence cannot hold in general in this setting. If the scaled potential is non-negative (hence non-resonant), the limit in strong resolvent sense is the Dirichlet Laplacian. We conjecture that we can drop the non-negativity assumption in the non-resonant case."

For the related two-dimensional model, we analyze some special characteristics of the equivalent reach-avoid probability. On this basis, we provide a special improved value-type algorithm to obtain the equivalent maximal reach-avoid probability and its $ε$-optimal policy. Then, at the last step of the algorithm, by the equivalence between these two models, we obtain the original maximal reach-avoid probability and its $ε$-optimal policy for the original model."

A natural problem is to study the qualitative boundary behavior of harmonic maps with rough boundary and/or non-smooth boundary data.
  For the special case where $u$ is a harmonic function on a domain $Ω\subset \mathbb R^n$, this problem has been extensively studied (see, for instance, the monograph \cite{Kenig94}, the proceedings of ICM 2010 \cite{Tor10} and the recent work of Mourgoglou-Tolsa \cite{MT24}). The $W^{1,p}$-regularity ($1<p<\infty$) has been well-established when $\partialΩ$ is Lipschitz (or even more general) and the boundary data belongs to $W^{1,p}(\partialΩ)$. However, for the endpoint case where the boundary data is Lipschitz continous, as demonstrated by Hardy-Littlewood's classical examples \cite{HL32}, the gradient $|\nabla u|(x)$ may have logarithmic growth as $x$ approaches the boundary $\partial Ω$ even if the boundary is smooth.
  In this paper, we first establish a version of the Gauss-Green formula for bounded domains in $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure space. We then apply it to obtain the optimal boundary regularity of harmonic maps from $RCD(K, N)$ metric measure spaces into $CAT(0)$ metric spaces. Our result is new even for harmonic functions on Lipschitz domains of Euclidean spaces."

However, its application remains challenging due to the deep expertise and extensive development effort required. Traditional TO methods, tightly coupled with computational mechanics like finite element method (FEM), result in intrusive algorithms demanding a comprehensive system understanding. This paper presents SOPTX, a TO package based on FEALPy, which implements a modular architecture that decouples analysis from optimization, supports multiple computational backends (NumPy, PyTorch, JAX), and achieves a non-intrusive design paradigm. Core innovations include: (1) cross-platform design that supports multiple computational backends, enabling efficient algorithm execution on central processing units (CPUs) and flexible acceleration using graphics processing units (GPUs), while leveraging automatic differentiation (AD) technology for efficient sensitivity computation of objective and constraint functions; (2) fast matrix assembly techniques that overcome the performance bottlenecks of traditional numerical integration methods, significantly accelerating finite element computations and enhancing overall efficiency; (3) a modular framework supporting TO problems for arbitrary dimensions and meshes, allowing flexible configuration and extensibility of optimization workflows through a rich library of composable components. Using the density-based method for the classic compliance minimization problem with volume constraints as an example, numerical experiments demonstrate SOPTX's high efficiency in computational speed and memory usage, while showcasing its strong potential for research and engineering applications."

In this paper, we investigate the application of multivariate sampling Kantorovich (SK) operators for image reconstruction, with a particular focus on gap filling and speckle noise reduction. To understand the accuracy performances of the proposed algorithms, we first derive a quantitative estimate in $C(\R^n)$ for the error of approximation using the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, under weak regularity conditions. We also establish a convergence result and a quantitative estimate with respect to the dissimilarity index measured by the continuous SSIM for functions in Lebesgue spaces. Additionally, we prove a multidimensional linear prediction result, which is used to design a new SK-based reconstruction algorithm to handle missing data, that we call LP-SK algorithm. To address speckle noise, we integrate SK operators into a newly proposed Down-Up scaling approach. Numerical tests are presented on synthetic and real SAR images to validate the proposed methods. Performance is assessed using similarity metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, along with speckle-specific indexes. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art techniques highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."

The Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model, the harmonic process (HP), and the immediate exchange model (IEM) are all examples that fall into this class. Our upper and lower bounds depend only on two features: worst-case linear statistics and a kinetic factor, which is, in essence, graph-independent. For the three aforementioned examples, these bounds are sharp, and even saturate to an identity for HP and IEM in some log-concave regimes. The proof -- which yields bounds for eigenvalues even in the non-reversible context -- crucially exploits the rigidity of the eigenstructure of these models and quantitative contraction rates of the corresponding hidden parameter models recently introduced in [DMFG24, GRT25]."

2505.02386,Minimal Simplicial Degree $d$ Maps from Genus $g$ Surfaces to the Torus,"['math.CO', 'math.GT']","['Biplab Basak', 'Ayushi Trivedi']","The degree of a map between orientable manifolds is a fundamental concept in topology, offering deep insights into the structure of the manifolds and the nature of the corresponding maps. This concept has been extensively studied, particularly in the context of simplicial maps between orientable triangulable spaces. In 1982, Gromov proved that if degree $d$ maps exist from a genus $g$ orientable surface to a genus $h$ orientable surface for every $d \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $h$ must be 0 or 1.
  Recently, degree $d$ self-maps on spheres, particularly on genus 0 surfaces, have been investigated. In this paper, we focus on the unique minimal 7-vertex triangulation of the torus. We construct simplicial degree $d$ maps from a triangulation of a genus $g$ surface to the 7-vertex triangulation of the torus for $g \geq 1$. Our construction of degree $d$ maps is minimal for every $d$ when $g = 1,2$. If $g \geq 3$, then our construction remains minimal for $|d| \geq 2g - 1$.
  We believe that this concept will be highly useful in combinatorial topology, as it leads to several intriguing open problems. In the final section, we propose some of these open questions."

The main result of the paper is a modular convergence theorem established following a density approach. To do this, a Luxemburg norm convergence for the Steklov sampling series based on continuous functions with compact support, and a modular-type inequality in the case of functions in Orlicz spaces has been preliminary proved. As a particular case of general theory, the results in $L^p$, in the Zygmund (interpolation), and in the exponential spaces are deduced. A crucial aspect in the above results is the choice of both band- and duration- limited kernel functions satisfying the partition of the unit property; to provide such examples an equivalent condition based on the Poisson summation formula and the computation of the Fourier transform of the kernel has been employed."

2505.02347,Temporal Robustness in Discrete Time Linear Dynamical Systems,"['math.OC', 'cs.AI']","['Nilava Metya', 'Ankit Shah', 'Arunesh Sinha']","Discrete time linear dynamical systems, including Markov chains, have found many applications including in security settings such as in cybersecurity operations center (CSOC) management and in managing health risks. However, in these two scenarios, there is uncertainty about the time horizon for which the system runs. This creates uncertainty about the cost (or reward) incurred based on the state distribution when the system stops. Given past data samples of how long a system ran, we theoretically analyze the cost incurred at the stop of the system as a distributional robust cost estimation task in a Wasserstein ambiguity set. Towards this, we show an equivalence between a discrete time Markov Chain on a probability simplex and a global asymptotic stable (GAS) discrete time linear dynamical system, allowing us to base our study on a GAS system only. Then, we provide various polynomial time algorithms and hardness results for different cases in our theoretical study, including a novel proof of a fundamental result about Wassertein distance based polytope. We experiment with real world data in CSOC domain and prior data in health domain to reveal the benefits of our model and approach."
2505.02345,Optimal error estimates of a second-order temporally finite element method for electrohydrodynamic equations,['math.NA'],"['Shengfeng Wang', 'Zeyu Xia', 'Maojun Li']","In this work, we mainly present the optimal convergence rates of the temporally second-order finite element scheme for solving the electrohydrodynamic equation. Suffering from the highly coupled nonlinearity, the convergence analysis of the numerical schemes for such a system is rather rare, not to mention the optimal error estimates for the high-order temporally scheme. To this end, we abandon the traditional error analysis method following the process of energy estimate, which may lead to the loss of accuracy. Instead, we note that the charge density also possesses the ""energy"" decaying property directly derived by its governing equation, although it does not appear in the energy stability analysis. This fact allows us to control the error terms of the charge density more conveniently, which finally leads to the optimal convergence rates. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results, including the energy stability, mass conservation, and convergence rates."

Our framework is achieved by Banach representations of Roe algebras of metric spaces. We show that geometric Banach property (T) is a coarse geometric invariant, and it is equivalent to the existence of the Kazhdan projections in the Banach-Roe algebras. Further, we study the implications of this property for sequences of finite Cayley graphs, establishing two key results: 1. geometric Banach property (T) of such sequences implies Banach property (T) for their limit groups; 2. while the Banach coarse fixed point property implies geometric Banach property (T), the converse fails. Additionally, we provide a geometric characterization of V. Lafforgue's strong Banach property (T) for a residually finite group in terms of geometric Banach property (T) of its box spaces."

For any $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $ω=ω^0ω^1\ldots\in(\left\{0,1,\ldots,b-1\right\}^m)^\mathbb{N}$ let \[ K^ω=\left\{x\in[0,1): T_b^n(x)\notin I_{ω^n}~\forall n\geq 0\right\},\] where $I_{ω^n}$ is the $b$-adic basic interval generated by $ω^n$. Then $K^ω$ is called the survivor set of the open dynamical system $([0,1),T_b,I_ω)$ with respect to the sequence of holes $I_ω=\left\{I_{ω^n}: n\geq 0\right\}$. We show that the Hausdorff and lower box dimensions of $K^ω$ always conincide, and the packing and upper box dimensions of $K^ω$ also coincide. Moreover, we give sharp lower and upper bounds for the dimensions of $K^ω$, which can be calculated explicitly. For any admissible $α\leq β$ there exist infinitely many $ω$ such that $\dim_H K^ω=α$ and $\dim_P K^ω=β$. As applications we study badly approximable numbers in Diophantine approximation. For an arbitrary sequence of balls $\left\{B_n\right\}$, let $K\left(\left\{B_n\right\}\right)$ be the set of $x\in[0,1)$ such that $T_b^n(x)\notin B_n$ for all but finitely many $n\geq 0$. Assuming $\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{diam} \left(B_n\right)$ exists, we show that $\dim_H K\left(\left\{B_n\right\}\right)=1$ if and only if $\lim_{n\to\infty}\operatorname{diam} \left(B_n\right)=0$. For any positive function $φ$ on $\mathbb{N}$, let $E\left(φ\right)$ be the set of $x\in[0,1)$ satisfying $|T_b^n (x)-x|\geq φ(n)$ for all but finitely many $n$. If $\lim_{n\to\infty}φ(n)$ exists, then $\dim_H E(φ)=1$ if and only if $\lim_{n\to\infty}φ(n)=0$. Our results can be applied to study joint spectral radius of matrices. We show that the finiteness property for the joint spectral radius of associated adjacency matrices holds true."

2505.02330,On Trigonometric Interpolation and Its Applications,['math.NA'],['Xiaorong Zou'],"In this paper, we propose a new trigonometric interpolation algorithm and establish relevant convergent properties. The method adjusts an existing trigonometric interpolation algorithm such that it can better leverage Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to enhance efficiency. The algorithm can be formulated in a way such that certain cancellation effects can be effectively leveraged for error analysis, which enables us not only to obtain the desired uniform convergent rate of the approximation to a function, but desired uniform convergent rates for its derivatives as well.
  We further enhance the algorithm so it can be applied to non-periodic functions defined on bounded intervals. Numerical testing results confirm decent accurate performance of the algorithm. For its application, we demonstrate how it can be applied to estimate integrals and solve linear/non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). The test results show that it significantly outperforms Trapezoid/Simpson method on integral and standard Runge-Kutta algorithm on ODE. In addition, we show some numerical evidences that estimation error of the algorithm likely exhibits ``local property"", i.e. error at a point tends not to propagate, which avoids significant compounding error at some other place, as a remarkable advantage compared to polynomial-based approximations."
2505.02319,Efficient Krylov methods for linear response in plane-wave electronic structure calculations,"['math.NA', 'physics.comp-ph']","['Michael F. Herbst', 'Bonan Sun']","We propose a novel algorithm based on inexact GMRES methods for linear response calculations in density functional theory. Such calculations require iteratively solving a nested linear problem $\mathcal{E} δρ= b$ to obtain the variation of the electron density $δρ$. Notably each application of the dielectric operator $\mathcal{E}$ in turn requires the iterative solution of multiple linear systems, the Sternheimer equations. We develop computable bounds to estimate the accuracy of the density variation given the tolerances to which the Sternheimer equations have been solved. Based on this result we suggest reliable strategies for adaptively selecting the convergence tolerances of the Sternheimer equations, such that each application of $\mathcal{E}$ is no more accurate than needed. Experiments on challenging materials systems of practical relevance demonstrate our strategies to achieve superlinear convergence as well as a reduction of computational time by about 40% while preserving the accuracy of the returned response solution. Our algorithm seamlessly combines with standard preconditioning approaches known from the context of self-consistent field problems making it a promising framework for efficient response solvers based on Krylov subspace techniques."

One one hand, we show that if the sectional curvature $K\le 1/4$ or the sum of smallest two eigenvalues of Ricci curvature has a suitable lower bound, then the shrinker is isometric to $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^3$. We also show that if the scalar curvature $R\le 3$ and the shrinker is asymptotic to $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^3$, then the Euler characteristic $χ(M)\geq 0$ and equality holds if and only if the shrinker is isometric to $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^3$. On the other hand, we prove that if $K\le 1/2$ (or the bi-Ricci curvature is nonnegative) and $R\le\tfrac{3}{2}-δ$ for some $δ\in (0,\tfrac{1}{2}]$, then the shrinker is isometric to $\mathbb{R}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$. The proof of these classifications mainly depends on the asymptotic analysis by the evolution of eigenvalues of Ricci curvature, the Gauss-Bonnet-Chern formula with boundary and the integration by parts."

We prove that sound waves interact with particles of nearby velocities, which results in a damping or an amplification of these sound waves, depending on the sign of the derivative of the distribution function at the sound speed. This mechanism is very similar to the classical Landau damping which occurs in the Vlasov-Poisson system. If the sound waves are amplified then the thick spray model is linearly ill-posed in Sobolev spaces, even locally in time.
  We also show that such Landau damping type phenomena naturally arise when we couple an hyperbolic system of conservation laws with the Vlasov equation."

For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained case. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through investigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems in machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where the ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon."

  \[
  W_2(p_t(x,\cdot), p_t(y,\cdot)) = e^{-Kt} d(x,y),

  Moreover, for weighted smooth manifolds, we provide a direct proof of the rigidity theorem for all curvature bounds $K \in \mathbb{R}$. In particular, we characterize a class of weighted Euclidean spaces as the only spaces where the Wasserstein contraction is sharp for all pairs of points."
2505.02268,Phantom Domain Finite Element Method: A novel approach for heterogeneous materials,['math.NA'],"['Tianlong He', 'Philippe Karamian-Surville', 'Daniel Choï']","In this paper, we introduce the Phantom Domain Finite Element Method (PDFEM), a novel computational approach tailored for the efficient analysis of heterogeneous and composite materials. Inspired by fictitious domain methods, this method employs a structured mesh to discretize the entire material domain while utilizing separate, independent meshes for the inclusions. These inclusion meshes are coupled to the structured mesh via a substitution matrix, enabling them to act as phantom meshes that do not directly contribute to the final system of equations. This framework offers significant advantages, including enhanced flexibility in handling complex inclusion geometries and improved computational efficiency. To assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on structures containing inclusions of various geometries. In order to emphasize the efficiency of the PDFEM method, a numerical simulation is presented to highlight its advantages in the case of long natural fibers, such as flax and linen. These simulations are compared against FEM calculations, demonstrating the efficiency of PDFEM. Indeed, meshing such fine structures requires an extremely high number of elements, and in some cases, meshing becomes particularly challenging due to the complexity of the geometries."
2505.02267,Gaussian Cumulative Prospect Theory,['math.PR'],['Mederic Motte'],"We propose a novel parametrization of Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), as developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, that yields an explicit gamble valuation formula for Gaussian reward distributions. Specifically, we define parametric functions $ v_θ $, $ w^{-}_θ $, and $ w^{+}_θ $ satisfying three key properties. The first, \emph{validity}, ensures that for any parameter $θ$, the functions conform to the qualitative principles of CPT: $ v_θ $ is concave over gains and convex over losses with a steeper slope for losses; $ w^{-}_θ $ and $ w^{+}_θ $ are increasing, exhibit inverse S-shaped curves, and map 0 to 0 and 1 to 1. The second, \emph{richness}, guarantees that the parametrization is expressive enough to capture a wide range of behaviors: $ v_θ $ can exhibit arbitrary asymptotic behavior and convergence rates, while $ w^{-}_θ $ and $ w^{+}_θ $ can achieve any specified crossover points and slopes. The third, \emph{explicit valuation}, ensures that for any $θ$, the CPT valuation of a Gaussian-distributed gamble (with arbitrary mean and variance) can be computed in closed form -- enabling efficient approximations for bell-shaped reward distributions. This framework is designed for scalable and rapid computation, making it particularly suited for applications involving large populations. We demonstrate its practicality through two illustrative examples in population-level CPT modeling."

We prove: (1) $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ is contained in the Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{sder}$ of $\mathfrak{tder}$ of special derivations, i.e. satisfying the additional condition that $x_\infty\mapsto [b,x_\infty]$ for some element $b$, where $x_\infty:=x_1-x_0$; (2) $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ is stable under the involution of $\mathfrak{sder}$ induced by the exchange of $x_0$ and $x_\infty$. The first statement: (a) says that any element of $\mathfrak{dmr}_0$ satisfies the ""senary relation"" (a fact announced without proof by Ecalle in 2011); (b) implies the inclusion $\mathfrak{dmr}_0\subset \mathfrak{krv}_2$ (which was proved by Schneps in 2012 only conditionally to the truth of (1))."

2505.02259,Smooth Integer Encoding via Integral Balance,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']",['Stanislav Semenov'],"We introduce a novel method for encoding integers using smooth real-valued functions whose integral properties implicitly reflect discrete quantities. In contrast to classical representations, where the integer appears as an explicit parameter, our approach encodes the number N in the set of natural numbers through the cumulative balance of a smooth function f_N(t), constructed from localized Gaussian bumps with alternating and decaying coefficients. The total integral I(N) converges to zero as N tends to infinity, and the integer can be recovered as the minimal point of near-cancellation.
  This method enables continuous and differentiable representations of discrete states, supports recovery through spline-based or analytical inversion, and extends naturally to multidimensional tuples (N1, N2, ...). We analyze the structure and convergence of the encoding series, demonstrate numerical construction of the integral map I(N), and develop procedures for integer recovery via numerical inversion. The resulting framework opens a path toward embedding discrete logic within continuous optimization pipelines, machine learning architectures, and smooth symbolic computation."

To resolve this, we introduce relative weak convergence, an extension of weak convergence that compares a statistic or process to a sequence of <evolving processes. Relative weak convergence retains the essential consequences of classical weak convergence and coincides with it under stationarity. Crucially, it applies in general non-stationary settings where classical weak convergence fails. We establish concrete relative CLTs for random vectors and empirical processes, along with sequential, weighted, and bootstrap variants that parallel the state-of-the-art in stationary settings. Our framework and results offer simple, plug-in replacements for classical CLTs whenever stationarity is untenable, as illustrated by applications in nonparametric trend estimation and hypothesis testing."

We assume that the node number $n\ge 3$ and prove that in the controlled Kuramoto model (CKM) on complete graphs a synchronized solution that converges to the desired motion suffers a saddle-node ifurcation where a pair of stable and unstable ones born and that the corresponding solution is always asymptotically stable in the continuous limit (CL) if it exists. They are also proved to be the only synchronized solutions that are or can be stable in the CKM and CL, respectively, when the feedback gain is positive and the coupling constant is small enough for synchronized motions not to exist in the uncontrolled case. Moreover, we show based on the previous results that the asymptotically stable solution to the CL behaves as if it is an asymptotically stable one in the CKM when the node number is sufficiently large, even if the graphs are random dense or sparse, when the node number is sufficiently large. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the CKM on complete simple, and uniform random dense and sparse graphs."

As applications, we reinterpret classical gradings on matrix algebras such as those induced by Pauli matrices and the $\mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_n $-grading in terms of our setting."

For maps in a tongue, we characterize the unique maximal subset of the circle on which $f_{a,b}$ is Devaney chaotic. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of this maximal chaotic set varies real-analytically inside a tongue."
2505.02188,Generalized Double Operator Integrals for Continuous Spectrum Operators,"['math.FA', 'math.OA']",['Shih-Yu Chang'],"Continuous spectrum operators (CSOs), characterized by spectra comprising continuous intervals rather than discrete eigenvalues, are pivotal in quantum mechanics, wave propagation, and systems governed by partial differential equations. Traditional double operator integrals (DOIs), central to analyzing operator functions and perturbations, have been limited to operators with finite or countable spectra, relying critically on self-adjointness. This work introduces a comprehensive framework for Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs), extending DOI theory to non-self-adjoint operators through the spectral structure of CSOs. By reinterpreting DOIs as instances of the spectral mapping theorem for CSOs, we establish GDOIs as a rigorous generalization, enabling their application to operators with continuous spectra. Key contributions include the development of GDOIs' algebraic properties, perturbation formulas generalizing classical results, norm and Lipschitz-type inequalities, and continuity with respect to operator and function parameters. Applications to differentiating operator-valued functions demonstrate the framework's utility in functional calculus. Furthermore, integrating recent spectral mapping theorems allows natural extension to hybrid spectrum operators, bridging operator theory with applied fields. This work significantly expands the analytical toolbox for systems with continuous spectral phenomena, offering new methodologies for quantum mechanics, control theory, and stochastic analysis, where non-self-adjoint and continuous spectral features are fundamental. The results unify and extend existing operator-theoretic techniques, fostering interdisciplinary advances in mathematics, physics, and engineering."

We propose a novel Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) that improves optimality gaps for all benchmarks in the literature and scales up to handle larger ones. To tackle even larger instances, we introduce a refined Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm that improves the adaptability of LNS beyond case-specific configurations appearing in related literature.
  To bridge the gap in benchmark availability, we develop an instance generator that allows for extensive experimentation. For moderate datasets (25 and 50 requests), we evaluate the performance of both LBBD and LNS, the former being able to close the gap and the latter capable of providing near-optimal solutions. For larger instances (75 and 100 requests), we recreate indicative state-of-the-art metaheuristics to highlight the improvements introduced by our LNS refinements, while establishing its scalability."

The case of insulated diode when the electrons are deflected back towards the cathode at the point $x^{*}$ is considered. First, the initial VM system is reduced to the nonlinear singular limit system of ODEs for the potentials of electric and magnetic fields. The second step deals with the limit system's reduction to the new nonlinear singular ODE equation for effective potential $θ(x)$. The existence of non-negative solutions is proved for the last equation on the interval $[0, x^{*})$ where $θ(x)>0$. The most interesting and unexplored case is when $θ(x)<0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$ and corresponds to the case of an insulated diode. For the first time, a numerical analysis of complex bifurcation of solutions in insulated diode is considered for $θ(x)<0$ depending on parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams of the dependence of solution $θ(x)$ on a free point (free boundary) $x^{*}$ were constructed. Insulated diode spacing is found."
2505.02150,Paired 2-disjoint path covers of Bcube under the partitioned edge fault model,['math.CO'],"['Qingqiong Cai', 'Wenjing Zhang']","BCube network, as a typical distributed data center network topology, has significant advantages in fault tolerance, load balancing, and efficient routing due to its unique hierarchical structure. In terms of efficient routing, paired many-to-many m-disjoint path cover (m-DPC) plays an important role in message passing. To explore the capability of BCube in constructing paired many-to-many m-DPCs, this paper investigates whether arbitrary 2-DPC paths can be successfully constructed under the partitioned edge fault (PEF) model, especially in the case of a large number of link failures. Through this investigation, the paper aims to address the network fault tolerance issues related to path embedding problems. Theoretical proofs show that under the partitioned edge fault model, BCube exhibits exponential fault tolerance for constructing 2-DPC paths. This study, on one hand, expands the application of the partitioned edge fault model, and on the other hand, contributes to enhancing BCube's ability to achieve large-scale edge fault tolerance."

In this paper, we consider a class of nonsmooth nonconvex-concave minimax problems on Riemannian manifolds. Owing to the nonsmoothness of the objective function, existing minimax manifold optimization methods cannot be directly applied to solve this problem. We propose a manifold proximal gradient descent ascent (MPGDA) algorithm for solving the problem. At each iteration, the proposed algorithm alternately performs one or multiple manifold proximal gradient descent steps and a proximal ascent step. We prove that the MPGDA algorithm can find an $\varepsilon$-game-stationary point and an $\varepsilon$-optimization-stationary point of the considered problem within $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ iterations. Numerical experiments on fair sparse PCA and sparse spectral clustering are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the MPGDA algorithm."

As applications, we find the sufficient and necessary conditions for the invariance of those Triebel-Lizorkin-type spaces on the integrable index and also for the Sobolev-type embedding of all these spaces. The main novelty exists in that these results are of wide generality, the growth condition of growth functions is not only sufficient but also necessary for the boundedness of almost diagonal operators and hence this new framework of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin-type is optimal, some results either are new or improve the known ones even for known matrix-weighted Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, and, furthermore, even in the scalar-valued setting, all the results are also new."

The stability, convergence, and energy dissipation properties of the proposed scheme are proved, and numerical experiments are carried out to substantiate the theoretical findings."

Existing algorithms for solving this problem achieve linear convergence only under stronger conditions, which may not be met in many scenarios. We first introduce the Primal-Dual Proximal Gradient (PDPG) method and demonstrate that it converges linearly under an assumption where existing algorithms fail to achieve linear convergence. Building on insights gained from analyzing the convergence conditions of existing algorithms and PDPG, we further propose the inexact Dual Accelerated Proximal Gradient (iDAPG) method. This method achieves linear convergence under weaker conditions than those required by existing approaches. Moreover, even in cases where existing methods guarantee linear convergence, iDAPG can still provide superior theoretical performance in certain scenarios."

Estimating hypergradients (also known as implicit gradients) is crucial for developing gradient-based methods for bilevel optimization. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient technique for incorporating curvature information into the approximation of hypergradients and present a novel algorithmic framework based on the resulting enhanced hypergradient computation. We provide convergence rate guarantees for the proposed framework in both deterministic and stochastic scenarios, particularly showing improved computational complexity over popular gradient-based methods in the deterministic setting. This improvement in complexity arises from a careful exploitation of the hypergradient structure and the inexact Newton method. In addition to the theoretical speedup, numerical experiments demonstrate the significant practical performance benefits of incorporating curvature information."

2505.02089,Regularity properties of Macbeath-Hurwitz and related maps and surfaces,['math.CO'],['Gareth A.

Hall's criterion determines which of these two properties, called inner and outer regularity, $\mathcal M$ has. Inner (but not outer) regular maps $\mathcal M$ yield non-orientable regular maps ${\mathcal M}/{\rm C}_2$ of the same type with automorphism group $G$. If $q=p^3$ for a prime $p\equiv\pm 2$ or $\pm 3$ mod~$(7)$ the unique map $\mathcal M$ is inner regular if and only if $p\equiv 1$ mod~$(4)$. If $q=p$ for a prime $p\equiv\pm 1$ mod~$(7)$ there are three maps $\mathcal M$; we use the density theorems of Frobenius and Chebotarev to show that in this case the sets of such primes $p$ for which $0, 1, 2$ or $3$ of them are inner regular have relative densities $1/8$, $3/8$, $3/8$ and $1/8$ respectively. Hall's criterion and its consequences are extended to the analogous Macbeath maps of type $\{3,n\}$ obtained from ${\rm PSL}_2(q)$ for all $n\ge 7$; theoretical predictions on their number and properties are supported by evidence from the map databases of Conder and Poto\v cnik."
2505.02088,Twins: non-isomorphic models forced to be isomorphic. Part I,['math.LO'],['Saharon Shelah'],"For which (first-order complete, usually countable) $T$ do there exist non-isomorphic models of $T$ which become isomorphic after forcing with a forcing notion $\mathbb{P}$? Necessarily, $\mathbb{P}$ is non-trivial; i.e.~it adds some new set of ordinals. It is best if we also demand that it collapses no cardinal. It is better to demand on the one hand that the models are non-isomorphic, and even \emph{far} from each other (in a suitable sense), but on the other hand, $\mathcal{L}$-equivalent in some suitable logic $\mathcal{L}$. We give sufficient conditions: for theories with the independence property, we proved this when $\mathbb{P}$ adds no new $ω$-sequence. We may prove it ``for some $\mathbb{P}$,"" but better would be for some specific forcing notions. Best would be to characterize the pairs $(T,\mathbb{P})$ for which we have such models.
  The results say (e.g.) that there are models $M_1,M_2$ which are not isomorphic (and even \emph{far} from being isomorphic, in a rigorous sense) which become isomorphic when we extend the universe by adding a new branch to the tree $({}^{θ>}2,\lhd)$.
  We shall mention some specific choices of $\mathbb{P}$: mainly $({}^{θ>}2,\lhd)$ with $θ= θ^{<θ}$. That is, the reader just has to agree that starting with a universe $\mathbf{V}$ of set theory (i.e.~a model of $ZFC$) and a quasiorder $\mathbb{P}$, there are new directed $\mathbf{G} \subseteq \mathbb{P}$ meeting every dense subset of $D$ of $\mathbb{P}$, a universe $\mathbf{V}[\mathbf{G}]$ (so {it} satisfies $ZFC$) of which the original $\mathbf{V}$ is a transitive subclass. We may say that $\mathbf{V}[\mathbf{G}]$ (also denoted $\mathbf{V}^\mathbb{P}$) is the universe obtained by forcing with $\mathbb{P}$.

For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and each $k\in\{0,1,\cdots, n\}$, let $P_n^{(k)}$ denote the uniform probability measure on the set of permutations in $S_n$ with exactly $k$ fixed points. We obtain an exact formula for the expected number of inversions under the measure $P_n^{(k)}$ as well as for $P_n^{(k)}(σ^{-1}_i<σ^{-1}_j)$, for $1\le i<j\le n$, the $P_n^{(k)}$-probability that the number $i$ precedes the number $j$. In particular,
  up to a super-exponentially small correction as $n\to\infty$, the expected number of inversions in a random derangement $(k=0)$ is $\frac16n+\frac1{12}$ more than
  the value $\frac{n(n-1)}4$ that one obtains for a uniformly random
  general permutation in $S_n$. On the other hand, up to a super-exponentially small correction, for $k\ge2$, the expected number of inversions in a random permutation with $k$ fixed points is $\frac{k-1}6n+\frac{k^2-k-1}{12}$ less than $\frac{n(n-1)}4$. In the borderline case, $k=1$, up to a super-exponentially small correction, the expected number of inversions in a random permutation with one fixed point is $\frac1{12}$ more than $\frac{n(n-1)}4$. The proofs make strategic and perhaps novel use of the Chinese restaurant construction for a uniformly random permutation."

In this paper, we obtain some results about the cyclic permutations avoiding patterns in both one-line and cycle forms. In particular, we resolve two conjectures of Archer et al."

Maurer-Cartan elements of these graded Lie algebras correspond respectively to Nijenhuis elements and Rota-Baxter elements for the given multiplication. Explicit forms of these brackets are given to study Nijenhuis operators and Rota-Baxter operators on some Loday-type algebras.
2505.02042,Standing waves with prescribed mass for biharmonic NLS with positive dispersion and Sobolev critical exponent,['math.AP'],"['Juntao Sun', 'Shuai Yao', 'He Zhang']","We investigate standing waves with prescribed mass for a class of biharmonic Schrodinger equations with positive Laplacian dispersion in the Sobolev critical regime. By establishing novel energy inequalities and developing a direct minimization approach, we prove the existence of two normalized solutions for the corresponding stationary problem. The first one is a ground state with negative level, and the second one is a higher-energy solution with positive level. It is worth noting that we do not work in the space of radial functions, and do not use Palais-Smale sequences so as to avoid applying the relatively complex mini-max approach based on a strong topological argument. Finally, we explore the relationship between the ground states and the least action solutions, some asymptotic properties and dynamical behavior of solutions, such as the orbital stability and the global existence."
2505.02039,Spectral flow and Robin domains on metric graphs,['math.SP'],"['Ram Band', 'Marina Prokhorova', 'Gilad Sofer']","This paper is devoted to the Neumann-Kirchhoff Laplacian on a finite metric graph. We prove an index theorem relating the nodal deficiency of an eigenfunction with (1) the Morse index of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, (2) its positive index and the first Betti number of the graph. We then generalize this result, replacing nodal points of an eigenfunction f with its Robin points (these are points with a prescribed value of f'/f, known as the Robin parameter, or delta coupling, or cotangent of Prüfer angle). This provides the Robin count, a generalization of the nodal and Neumann counts of an eigenfunction. We relate the Robin count deficiency with the positive index of the Robin map (a generalization of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map). In addition, we show that two of the relevant indices are independent of the Prüfer angle. Our main tool is the spectral flow of the Laplacian with special families of boundary conditions. As an application of our results, we show that the spectral flow of these families is related to topological properties of the graph, such as its Betti number, the number of interaction vertices, and their positions with respect to the graph cycles."

Our primary focus is on the existence and multiplicity of bound states, which emerge as critical points of the NLDE Lagrangian functional. The associated action functional is strongly indefinite, and notably, the Palais-Smale condition fails to hold. To address these challenges, we employ recently developed critical point theorems to derive our results."

2505.02023,Matrix Factorizations with Uniformly Random Pivoting,['math.NA'],"['Isabel Detherage', 'Rikhav Shah']","This paper highlights a formal connection between two families of widely used matrix factorization algorithms in numerical linear algebra. One family consists of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm and its variants for computing the Hermitian eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition. The other consists of Gaussian elimination and the Gram-Schmidt procedure with various pivoting rules for computing the Cholesky decomposition and QR decomposition respectively.
  Both families are cast as special cases of a more general class of factorization algorithms. We provide a randomized pivoting rule that applies to this general class (which differs substantially from the usual pivoting rules for Gaussian elimination / Gram-Schmidt) which admits a unified analysis of the entire class of algorithms. The result is the same linear rate of convergence for each algorithm, irrespective of which factorization it computes.
  One important consequence of this randomized pivoting rule is a provable, effective bound on the numerical stability of the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm, which addresses a longstanding open problem of Demmel and Veselić `92."

However, it remains a challenge work, due to the lack of effective solution methods, to solve and track the quasi-periodic solutions with multiple base frequencies until now. In this work, a multi-steps variable-coefficient formulation (m-VCF) is proposed, which provides a unified framework to enable either harmonic balance method (HB) or collocation method (CO) or finite difference method (FD) to solve quasi-periodic solutions with multiple base frequencies. For this purpose, a method of alternating U and S domain (AUS) is also developed to efficiently evaluate the nonlinear force terms. Furthermore, a new robust phase condition is presented for all of the three methods to make them track the quasi-periodic solutions with prior unknown multiple base frequencies, while the stability of the quasi-periodic solutions is assessed by mean of Lyapunov exponents. The feasibility of the constructed methods under the above framework is verified by application to three nonlinear systems."

The main results describe how the solution and the value of the problem change if the objective function is perturbed. Examples include linear, quadratic, and smooth additive perturbations.

2505.01987,Sharp empirical Bernstein bounds for the variance of bounded random variables,['math.ST'],"['Diego Martinez-Taboada', 'Aaditya Ramdas']","We develop novel empirical Bernstein inequalities for the variance of bounded random variables. Our inequalities hold under constant conditional variance and mean, without further assumptions like independence or identical distribution of the random variables, making them suitable for sequential decision making contexts. The results are instantiated for both the batch setting (where the sample size is fixed) and the sequential setting (where the sample size is a stopping time). Our bounds are asymptotically sharp: when the data are iid, our CI adpats optimally to both unknown mean $μ$ and unknown $\mathbb{V}[(X-μ)^2]$, meaning that the first order term of our CI exactly matches that of the oracle Bernstein inequality which knows those quantities. We compare our results to a widely used (non-sharp) concentration inequality for the variance based on self-bounding random variables, showing both the theoretical gains and improved empirical performance of our approach. We finally extend our methods to work in any separable Hilbert space."
2505.01985,Optimization over Trained (and Sparse) Neural Networks: A Surrogate within a Surrogate,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']","['Hung Pham', 'Aiden Ren', 'Ibrahim Tahir', 'Jiatai Tong', 'Thiago Serra']","We can approximate a constraint or an objective function that is uncertain or nonlinear with a neural network that we embed in the optimization model. This approach, which is known as constraint learning, faces the challenge that optimization models with neural network surrogates are harder to solve. Such difficulties have motivated studies on model reformulation, specialized optimization algorithms, and - to a lesser extent - pruning of the embedded networks. In this work, we double down on the use of surrogates by applying network pruning to produce a surrogate of the neural network itself. In the context of using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to verify neural networks, we obtained faster adversarial perturbations for dense neural networks by using sparse surrogates, especially - and surprisingly - if not taking the time to finetune the sparse network to make up for the loss in accuracy. In other words, we show that a pruned network with bad classification performance can still be a good - and more efficient - surrogate."
2505.01975,Collective steering: Tracer-informed dynamics,['math.OC'],"['Asmaa Eldesoukey', 'Mahmoud Abdelgalil', 'Tryphon T.

Our data consist of i) statistics on the ensemble and ii) trajectories or final disposition of selected tracer particles embedded in the flow. Our aim is i') to specify a control protocol to realize a flow that meets such constraints or ii') to recover the internal dynamics that are consistent with such a data set. We analyze these problems in the setting of linear flows and Gaussian distributions. The control cost is taken to be a suitable action integral constrained by either the trajectories of tracer particles or their terminal placements.

Due to the ergodicity of the controlled process, the associated system of Hamiltonian-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations exhibits non-uniqueness in its solutions. We establish a two-stage verification theorem that connects the differential game problem with the HJB equations. The first stage involves the characterization of the Nash equilibrium and ergodic constants. The second stage focuses on the non-unique solutions of the HJB equations, which are linked to the value function of an auxiliary control problem. At the end, we analyze the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) case, leading to an intriguing set of measure-dependent algebraic Riccati equations."
2505.01971,Negative Dependence in Knockout Tournaments,['math.PR'],"['Yuting Su', 'Zhenfeng Zou', 'Taizhong Hu']","Negative dependence in tournaments has received attention in the literature. The property of negative orthant dependence (NOD) was proved for different tournament models with a special proof for each model. For general round-robin tournaments and knockout tournaments with random draws, Malinovsky and Rinott (2023) unified and simplified many existing results in the literature by proving a stronger property, negative association (NA). For a knockout tournament with a non-random draw, Malinovsky and Rinott (2023) presented an example to illustrate that S is NOD but not NA. However, their proof is not correct. In this paper, we establish the properties of negative regression dependence (NRD), negative left-tail dependence (NLTD) and negative right-tail dependence (NRTD) for a knockout tournament with a random draw and with players being of equal strength. For a knockout tournament with a non-random draw and with equal strength, we prove that S is NA and NRTD, while S is, in general, not NRD or NLTD."

2505.01952,Dynamics of Diseased-Impacted Prey Populations: Defense and Allee Effect Mechanisms,"['math.DS', 'q-bio.PE']","['Kwadwo Antwi-Fordjour', 'Zachary Overton', 'Dylan Lee']","This study introduces an innovative framework for merging ecological and epidemiological modeling via the formulation of a sophisticated predator-prey model that addresses the intricacies of disease dynamics, the Allee effect, and defensive mechanisms through prey aggregation. Employing rigorous stability and bifurcation analyses, we identify multiple feasible equilibria and establish critical thresholds that influence population survival and extinction. Our mathematical model reveals that the intensity of the Allee effect plays a crucial role in shaping population recovery and disease persistence, offering pivotal insights into finite time extinction mechanisms. We further illustrate, through extensive numerical simulations, that adjusting susceptible prey aggregation strategically can substantially reduce disease transmission, emphasizing the applicability of our findings for practical conservation interventions. The combined modulation of the aggregation constant and Allee effect determined three primary ecological outcomes: stable coexistence, elimination of infected prey, and complete population extinction. Moreover, these results have significant implications for wildlife management and ecosystem resilience, providing a solid theoretical framework for interdisciplinary strategies aimed at protecting endangered species."

It is demonstrated that the hexagonators appearing at second order satisfy the requisite axioms of a braided monoidal cochain 2-category provided that the strict infinitesimal 2-braiding is totally symmetric and coherent (in Cirio and Faria Martins' sense). We show that those infinitesimal 2-braidings induced by 2-shifted Poisson structures are indeed totally symmetric and we relate coherency to the third-weight component of the Maurer-Cartan equation that a 2-shifted Poisson structure must satisfy. Furthermore, we show that 3-shifted Poisson structures and ``coboundary"" 2-shifted Poisson structures induce syllepses."

In the setting of singular Ricci flat Kähler cone metrics that arise as non-collapsed limits of sequences of Kähler-Einstein metrics or Kähler-Ricci flows, we show that an a priori weaker notion is equivalent to the stronger one introduced by Eyssidieux-Guedj-Zeriahi, and in particular the underlying variety has log terminal singularities in this case. Our method applies to more general singular Kähler-Einstein spaces as well, assuming that they define RCD spaces."

We define an operation $\cdot_F$ on linear orders $L$ and $M$ by $L \cdot_F M = \operatorname{o.t.}\left((LM)/\!\sim_F\right)$; that is, $L \cdot_F M$ is the order type of the lexicographic product of $L$ and $M$ modulo the finite condensation. The infinite order types $L$ such that $L / \! \sim_F\, \cong 1$ are $ω, ω^*,$ and $ζ$ (where $ω^*$ is the reverse ordering of $ω$, and $ζ$ is the order type of $\mathbb{Z}$). We show that under the operation $\cdot_F$, the set $R=\{1, ω, ω^*, ζ\}$ forms a left regular band. Further, each of the ordinal elements of $R$ defines, via left or right multiplication modulo the finite condensation, a weakly order-preserving map on the class of ordinals. We study these maps' effect on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form. In particular, we examine the extent to which one of these maps, sending $α$ to the order type of $α$ modulo the finite condensation, behaves similarly to a derivative operator on the ordinals of finite degree in Cantor normal form."

To this end, we consider the complete prime spectrum of an essentially small monoidal triangulated category, which we show is universal among support data satisfying the tensor product property, even if it is empty. The complete prime spectrum is functorial and parametrizes radical thick tensor-ideals, a noncommutative analogue of Balmer's reconstruction theorem. We give criteria for when induced maps on complete prime spectra are injective or surjective, and determine the complete prime spectrum for crossed product categories. Finally, we determine the universal functorial support theory for monoidal triangulated categories coinciding with the Balmer spectrum on braided monoidal triangulated categories."

We demonstrate that such a manifold reduces to a GRW space-time under specific conditions: when the generator of the observed connection is a unit timelike vector. Also, in that case, the mentioned connection becomes a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection. The non-zero nature of the three curvature tensors and their corresponding Ricci tensors motivates an exploration of manifold symmetries. In this way, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the manifold to be Einstein and we prove that a perfect fluid space-time with a semi-symmetric metric $P$-connection is Ricci pseudo-symmetric manifold of constant type. Furthermore, we show that if this space-time satisfies the Einstein's field equations without the cosmological constant, the strong energy condition is violated."

In the n-agent model, each agent can strategically inject capital to ensure that the total wealth outperforms the benchmark process, which is modeled as a linear combination of the population's average wealth process and an exogenous market index process. That is, each agent is concerned about the performance of her competitors captured by the floor constraint. With a continuum of agents, we formulate the constrained MFG problem and transform it into an equivalent unconstrained MFG problem with a reflected state process. We establish the existence of the mean field equilibrium (MFE) using the PDE approach. Firstly, by applying the dual transform, the best response control of the representative agent can be characterized in analytical form in terms of a dual reflected diffusion process. As a novel contribution, we verify the consistency condition of the MFE in separated domains with the help of the duality relationship and properties of the dual process."

This rank-one approximation is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning algorithm in the learning problem.

To overcome the large dimensionality of the parameter space and the complexity of the regularization functional, {sparisty-promoting} techniques for both deterministic and hierarchical Bayesian regularization rely on solving a sequence of high-dimensional iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) problems on a lower-dimensional subspace. Generalized Krylov subspace (GKS) methods are a particularly potent class of hybrid Krylov schemes that efficiently solve sequences of IRLS problems by projecting large-scale problems into a relatively small subspace and successively enlarging it. We refer to methods that promote sparsity and use GKS as S-GKS. A disadvantage of S-GKS methods is their slow convergence. In this work, we propose techniques that improve the convergence of S-GKS methods by combining them with priorconditioning, which we refer to as PS-GKS. Specifically, integrating the PS-GKS method into the IAS algorithm allows us to automatically select the shape/rate parameter of the involved generalized gamma hyper-prior, which is often fine-tuned otherwise. Furthermore, we proposed and investigated variations of the proposed PS-GKS method, including restarting and recycling (resPS-GKS and recPS-GKS). These respectively leverage restarted and recycled subspaces to overcome situations when memory limitations of storing the basis vectors are a concern. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis showing the benefits of priorconditioning for sparsity-promoting inverse problems. Numerical experiment are used to illustrate that the proposed PS-GKS method and its variants are competitive with or outperform other existing hybrid Krylov methods."

The first representation simplifies the dependence structure by replacing empirical distribution functions with their population counterparts. The second representation leverages the Hájek projection technique to decompose the initial form into a sum of independent components, thereby rigorously justifying asymptotic normality. Simulation studies demonstrate the appropriateness of two proposed asymptotic representations, as well as their excellent approximation to the limiting normal distribution."

We establish the following results without requiring additional regularity conditions: (1) the augmented Lagrangian dual function $φ_ρ(λ) = \inf_x \cL_ρ(x, λ)$ is $\frac{1}ρ$-smooth everywhere; and (2) the solution to $\min_{x \in \R^d} \cL_ρ(x, λ)$ exists for any dual variable $λ\in \R^p$, where $ρ> 0$ is the augmented parameter and $\cL_ρ(x, λ) = f(x) + \dotprod{λ, A x - b} + \fracρ{2}\norm{A x - b}^2$ is the augmented Lagrangian.

While the Wasserstein metric has proven effective in addressing these issues in time-domain FWI, its applicability in frequency-domain FWI is limited due to the complex-valued nature of the data and reduced transport-like dependency on wave speed. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the HV metric ($d_{\text{HV}}$), inspired by optimal transport theory, which compares signals based on horizontal and vertical changes without requiring the normalization of data. We implement $d_{\text{HV}}$ as the misfit function in frequency-domain FWI and evaluate its performance on synthetic and real-world datasets from seismic imaging and ultrasound computed tomography (USCT). Numerical experiments demonstrate that $d_{\text{HV}}$ outperforms the $L^2$ and Wasserstein metrics in scenarios with limited prior model information and high noise while robustly improving inversion results on clinical USCT data."

The minimum cardinality of a paired dominating set of $G$ is the paired domination number $\gpr(G)$ of $G$.

We formulate the operational volume allocation problem in drayage procurement as a multistage stochastic transportation problem and solve it using stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). We employ a multivariate count time series approach from the literature to model cargo flow dynamics, relaxing independence assumptions and capturing complex correlations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of SDDP and its effectiveness in approximating high-quality policies across realistic problem instances. Sensitivity analyses highlight the significant impact of inflow uncertainties on costs, while spot market variability has a comparatively minor effect. Additionally, we propose an alternative stopping rule for SDDP iterations, balancing computational efficiency and solution fidelity."
2505.01808,Integrated optimization of operations and capacity planning under uncertainty for drayage procurement in container logistics,"['math.OC', 'stat.AP']","['Georgios Vassos', 'Richard Lusby', 'Pierre Pinson']","We present an integrated framework for truckload procurement in container logistics, bridging strategic and operational aspects that are often treated independently in existing research. Drayage, the short-haul trucking of containers, plays a critical role in intermodal container logistics. Using dynamic programming, we identify optimal operational policies for allocating drayage volumes among capacitated carriers under uncertain container flows and spot rates. The computational complexity of optimization under uncertainty is mitigated through sample average approximation. These optimal policies serve as the basis for evaluating specific capacity arrangements. To optimize capacity reservations with strategic and spot carriers, we employ an efficient quasi-Newton method. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant cost-efficiency improvements, including a 21.2% cost reduction in a four-period scenario. Monte Carlo simulations further highlight the strong generalization capabilities of the proposed joint optimization method across out-of-sample scenarios. These findings underscore the importance of integrating strategic and operational decisions to enhance cost efficiency in truckload procurement under uncertainty."
2505.01807,Surrogate to Poincaré inequalities on manifolds for dimension reduction in nonlinear feature spaces,"['math.NA', 'cs.LG']","['Anthony Nouy', 'Alexandre Pasco']","We aim to approximate a continuously differentiable function $u:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a composition of functions $f\circ g$ where $g:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, $m\leq d$, and $f : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are built in a two stage procedure. For a fixed $g$, we build $f$ using classical regression methods, involving evaluations of $u$. Recent works proposed to build a nonlinear $g$ by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{J}(g)$ derived from Poincaré inequalities on manifolds, involving evaluations of the gradient of $u$. A problem is that minimizing $\mathcal{J}$ may be a challenging task. Hence in this work, we introduce new convex surrogates to $\mathcal{J}$. Leveraging concentration inequalities, we provide sub-optimality results for a class of functions $g$, including polynomials, and a wide class of input probability measures. We investigate performances on different benchmarks for various training sample sizes. We show that our approach outperforms standard iterative methods for minimizing the training Poincaré inequality based loss, often resulting in better approximation errors, especially for rather small training sets and $m=1$."

The inherent combinatorial optimization problem is reformulated as a continuous optimization problem with a non-convex regularization term that promotes discreteness of the control. We prove that any solution obtained from the relaxed problem is also a solution to the original problem. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is efficiently solved through time discretization. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

By techniques of convex and variational analysis, conditions for the existence of robust feasible solutions and related error bounds are investigated. This is done by reformulating the robust counterpart of a split feasibility problem as a set-valued inclusion, a problem for which one can take profit from the solvability and stability theory that has been recently developed. As a result, a sufficient condition for solution existence and error bounds is established in terms of problem data and discussed through several examples. A specific focus is devoted to error bound conditions in the case of the robust counterpart of polyhedral split feasibility problems."

2505.01751,A dynamic view of some anomalous phenomena in SGD,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']",['Vivek Shripad Borkar'],"It has been observed by Belkin et al.\ that over-parametrized neural networks exhibit a `double descent' phenomenon. That is, as the model complexity (as reflected in the number of features) increases, the test error initially decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. A counterpart of this phenomenon in the time domain has been noted in the context of epoch-wise training, viz., the test error decreases with the number of iterates, then increases, then decreases again. Another anomalous phenomenon is that of \textit{grokking} wherein two regimes of descent are interrupted by a third regime wherein the mean loss remains almost constant. This note presents a plausible explanation for these and related phenomena by using the theory of two time scale stochastic approximation, applied to the continuous time limit of the gradient dynamics. This gives a novel perspective for an already well studied theme."

The flux and the Bernoulli function are prescribed at each point of the boundary $\partial D$. The previous existence proof relying on the Nash-Moser iteration scheme is replaced by an adaptation of Kato's approach to locally coercive problems, allowing a more precise statement: the regularity required in Sobolev spaces is the one needed to ensure a basic local coercivity property, and there is a loss of control of only two derivatives in the obtained solutions. The underlying variational structure gives an additional property: the obtained solutions are local minimizers of an integral functional. The strategy of proof is first developed for a simpler nonlinear partial differential equation in two variables which satisfies a weaker form of ellipticity."

They converge, as the degree $d$ of the polynomials increases, to the additive and multiplicative convolution of measures from free probability of Voiculescu. In this paper, we investigate the fluctuations of order $1/d$ -- also known as infinitesimal distributions -- related to these two operations and their limiting behavior, providing a detailed description of their convergence. Our approach relies on understanding the infinitesimal moment-cumulant formulas and the corresponding functional relations.

For the construction, we transform the stochastic one-$δ$ motions studied in [7] by Girsanov's theorem locally before a pair of particles with different initial conditions begins to contact each other. The strong Markov processes with lifetime thus obtained are concatenated by using the ""no-triple-contacts"" (NTC).

One of the primary tools used to study factorization is elasticity - a measure of how badly unique factorization fails in a domain. This paper explores properties of orders in a number field and how they can be used to study elasticity in not only the orders themselves, but also in rings of formal power series over the orders. Of particular interest is the fact, proven here, that power series extensions in finitely many variables over half-factorial rings of algebraic integers must themselves be half-factorial. It is also shown that the HFD property is not preserved in general for power series rings over non-integrally closed orders in a number field."

In this study, we investigate the data informativity subject to noise characterized by quadratic matrix inequalities (QMIs), which describe constraints through matrix-valued quadratic functions. We introduce a generalized noise model, referred to as data perturbation, under which we derive necessary and sufficient conditions formulated as tractable linear matrix inequalities for data informativity with respect to stabilization and performance guarantees via state feedback, as well as stabilization via output feedback. Our proposed framework encompasses and extends existing analyses that consider exogenous disturbances and measurement noise, while also relaxing several restrictive assumptions commonly made in prior work. A central challenge in the data perturbation setting arises from the non-convexity of the set of systems consistent with the data, which renders standard matrix S-procedure techniques inapplicable. To resolve this issue, we develop a novel matrix S-procedure that does not rely on convexity of the system set by exploiting geometric properties of QMI solution sets. Furthermore, we derive sufficient conditions for data informativity in the presence of multiple noise sources by approximating the combined noise effect through the QMI framework. The proposed results are broadly applicable to a wide class of noise models and subsume several existing methodologies as special cases."

We also derive formulae for their two-legged counterparts $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2ν,j)$. Our method recovers the known explicit results for graphs embedded on the plane and the torus, and extends them to all genera $g \geq 2$. In earlier work, Ercolani, Lega, and Tippings (2023) showed that $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2ν,j)$ and $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2ν,j)$ admit structural expressions as linear combinations of, respectively, $3g-2$ and $3g$ Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, but with coefficients left undetermined. The framework developed here provides a systematic procedure to compute these coefficients, thereby turning the structural expressions into fully explicit formulae for $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2ν,j)$ and $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2ν,j)$ as functions of both $j$ and $ν$. Detailed results are given for $g=2,3,$ and $4$, and the framework extends naturally to all $g \geq 5$ with increasing computational effort.

However, we show that if the transition rates are i.i.d. random variables with a common distribution satisfying certain tail conditions, then the resulting stationary distribution is close in total variation distance to the distribution that is proportional to the inverse of the exit rates of the states. This result, which generalizes and makes a precise prediction of Chvykov et al. (2021), constitutes the first rigorous validation of an emerging physical theory of order in non-equilibrium systems. The proof entails showing that the stationary distribution of the corresponding ""jump chain,"" i.e., the discrete-time Markov chain with transition probabilities given by the normalized transition rates, is asymptotically uniform as the number of states grows, which settles a question raised by Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafaï (2012) under certain assumptions."

By applying the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension, the $d$-dimensional fractional equation is reformulated as a local partial differential equation in $d+1$ dimensions. We propose a quantum algorithm for the finite element discretization of this local problem, by capturing the steady-state of the corresponding differential equations using the Schrödingerization approach from \cite{JLY22SchrShort, JLY22SchrLong, analogPDE}. The Schrödingerization technique transforms general linear partial and ordinary differential equations into Schrödinger-type systems, making them suitable for quantum simulation. This is achieved through the warped phase transformation, which maps the equation into a higher-dimensional space. We provide detailed implementations of the method and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis, which can show up to exponential advantage -- with respect to the inverse of the mesh size in high dimensions -- compared to its classical counterpart. Specifically, while the classical method requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/2} 3^{3d/2} h^{-d-2})$ operations, the quantum counterpart requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d 3^{3d/2} h^{-2.5})$ queries to the block-encoding input models, with the quantum complexity being independent of the dimension $d$ in terms of the inverse mesh size $h^{-1}$.

Assuming a general reinforcement rule, exchangeable MVPSs can be viewed as extensions of Blackwell and MacQueen's Pólya sequence, which characterizes an exchangeable sequence whose directing random measure has a Dirichlet process prior distribution. Here, we show that the prior distribution of any exchangeable MVPS is a Dirichlet process mixture with respect to a latent parameter that is associated with the atoms of an emergent conditioning $σ$-algebra. As the mixing components have disjoint supports, the directing random measure can be interpreted as a random histogram whose bins are located on these same atoms. Furthermore, we extend the basic exchangeable MVPS to include a null component in the reinforcement, which corresponds to having a fixed part in the directing random measure. Finally, we provide set-wise rates of convergence of the empirical and predictive distributions of any exchangeable MVPS to its directing random measure in the form of a central limit theorem."
2505.01593,Bilateral base-extension semantics,"['math.LO', 'cs.LO']","['Victor Barroso-Nascimento', 'Maria Osório']","Bilateralism is the position according to which assertion and rejection are conceptually independent speech acts. Logical bilateralism demands that systems of logic provide conditions for assertion and rejection that are not reducible to each other, which often leads to independent definitions of proof rules (for assertion) and dual proof rules, also called refutation rules (for rejection). Since it provides a critical account of what it means for something to be a proof or a refutation, bilateralism is often studied in the context of proof-theoretic semantics, an approach that aims to elucidate both the meaning of proofs (and refutations) and what kinds of semantics can be given if proofs (and refutations) are considered as basic semantic notions. The recent literature on bilateral proof-theoretic semantics has only dealt with the semantics of proofs and refutations, whereas we deal with semantics in terms of proofs and refutations. In this paper we present a bilateral version of base-extension semantics - one of the most widely studied proof-theoretic semantics - by allowing atomic bases to contain both atomic proof rules and atomic refutation rules. The semantics is shown to be sound and complete with respect to the bilateral dual intuitionistic logic 2Int. Structural similarities between atomic proofs and refutations also allow us to define duality notions for atomic rules, deductions and bases, which may then be used for the proof of bilateral semantic harmony results. Aside from enabling embeddings between different fragments of the language, bilateral semantic harmony is shown to be a restatement of the syntactic horizontal inversion principle, whose meaning-conferring character may now be interpreted as the requirement of preservation of harmony notions already present at the core of the semantics by inferences."

II,"['math.AP', 'math.FA']","['Duván Cardona', 'Manuel Alejandro Martínez']","In this paper we continue our program of revisiting the new aspects about the boundedness properties of pseudo-differential operators on the torus. Here we prove $H^p$-$L^p$ and $H^p$-estimates for Hörmander classes of pseudo-differential operators on the torus $\mathbb{T}^n$ for $p\leq 1$. The results are presented in the context of the global symbolic analysis developed by Ruzhansky and Turunen on $\mathbb{T}^n \times \mathbb{Z}^n$ by using the discrete Fourier analysis, which extends the $(ρ, δ)$-Hörmander classes on $\mathbb{T}^n$ defined by local coordinate systems. These results extend those proved by Álvarez and Hounie for the Euclidean case, considering even the case $ρ\leqδ$."
2505.01564,Order-detection and non-left-orderable surgeries on links,['math.GT'],"['Adam Clay', 'Junyu Lu']","Beginning with a $3$-manifold $M$ having a single torus boundary component, there are several computational techniques in the literature that use a presentation of the fundamental group of $M$ to produce infinite families of Dehn fillings of $M$ whose fundamental groups are non-left-orderable. In this manuscript, we show how to use order-detection of slopes to generalise these techniques to manifolds with multiple torus boundary components, and to produce results that are sharper than what can be achieved with traditional techniques alone. As a demonstration, we produce an infinite family of hyperbolic links where many of the manifolds arising from Dehn filling have non-left-orderable fundamental groups. The family includes the Whitehead link, and in that case we produce a collection of non-left-orderable Dehn fillings that precisely matches the prediction of the L-space conjecture."

In particular, we consider a family of doubly weighted spaces that encode algebraic decay/growth of functions at infinity, and near the origin. Our results give conditions on the weights under which the operators are either injective, surjective, or isomorphisms. We also give a precise description of the kernel and range of these operators."
2505.01526,A non-asymptotic approach to stochastic differential games with many players under semi-monotonicity,"['math.PR', 'math.AP']","['Marco Cirant', 'Joe Jackson', 'Davide Francesco Redaelli']","We consider stochastic differential games with a large number of players, with the aim of quantifying the gap between closed-loop, open-loop and distributed equilibria. We show that, under two different semi-monotonicity conditions, the equilibrium trajectories are close when the interactions between the players are weak. Our approach is non-asymptotic in nature, in the sense that it does not make use of any a priori identification of a limiting model, like in mean field game (MFG) theory. The main technical step is to derive bounds on solutions to systems of PDE/FBSDE characterizing the equilibria that are independent of the number of players. When specialized to the mean field setting, our estimates yield quantitative convergence results for both open-loop and closed-loop equilibria without any use of the master equation. In fact, our main bounds hold for games in which interactions are much sparser than those of MFGs, and so we can also obtain some ""universality"" results for MFGs, in which we show that games governed by dense enough networks converge to the usual MFG limit. Finally, we use our estimates to study a joint vanishing viscosity and large population limit in the setting of displacement monotone games without idiosyncratic noise."

For optimal spline subspaces and specific reduced spline spaces, represented in terms of B-spline-like bases, we show that the corresponding mass and stiffness matrices exhibit a Toeplitz-minus-Hankel or Toeplitz-plus-Hankel structure. Such matrix structure holds for any degree p and implies that the eigenvalues are an explicitly known sampling of the spectral symbol of the Toeplitz part. Moreover, by employing tensor-product arguments, we extend the closed-form property of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to a d-dimensional box. As a side result, we have an algebraic confirmation that the considered optimal and reduced spline spaces are indeed outlier-free."

2505.01444,Order Structures around Evolution Algebras,['math.RA'],['Alejandro González Nevado'],"We consider evolution algebras and their related substructures: evolution ideals and evolution subalgebras. After exposing some of the concepts related to them in the literature, we explore the order structures that arise in the sets of substructures of an evolution algebra. This leads to the introduction of the socle of an evolution algebra and to the study of its connection with some distinguished elements within the algebra (such as idempotents and natural elements). Finally, we examine the order structures that emerge among these elements when we consider the substructures that they generate inside the algebra. Thus, we develop two order-theoretic approaches (one using distinguished substructures and other using distinguished elements). These two strategies could be used in many ways. Particularly, we direct them towards the study of the socle of an evolution algebra."

Taking into account one of the existing models (Winkler or Pasternak), the contact conditions between the coating and the reinforcement elements and the influence of the medium on the coating, the frequency equation of oscillation was solved, the results were analyzed. Theory of hereditary type damage under the action of external force is often used for taking into account the damages in the structure of a cylindrical shell forced to vibration. The Hamilton-Ostrogradsky variational principle is used for solving the problem. The results obtained can be used in the foundations of bridges built across mountain rivers. Such support is cost-effective. It should be noted that reinforcement and concrete mortar are also used in the internal parts of the cylindrical supports used. The article proposes to fill the inside of the cylindrical lid under study with clay."

We express the generators of the $K_0$-groups in terms of the corresponding matrix coefficients for two specific examples: the group of $p$-adic integers and the $p$-adic Heisenberg group. Finally, we prove the nonexistence of a natural class of spectral triples on the group of $p$-adic integers."

The products can be divided into two distinct sets according to the route they will follow through the machines of the unit. The mathematical models of the individual subsystems of the plant using finite deterministic automata will be presented. The two different routes that the products can follow will be presented.

2505.01423,Negative Stepsizes Make Gradient-Descent-Ascent Converge,"['math.OC', 'cs.DS', 'cs.LG']","['Henry Shugart', 'Jason M. Altschuler']","Efficient computation of min-max problems is a central question in optimization, learning, games, and controls. Arguably the most natural algorithm is gradient-descent-ascent (GDA). However, since the 1970s, conventional wisdom has argued that GDA fails to converge even on simple problems. This failure spurred an extensive literature on modifying GDA with additional building blocks such as extragradients, optimism, momentum, anchoring, etc. In contrast, we show that GDA converges in its original form by simply using a judicious choice of stepsizes.
  The key innovation is the proposal of unconventional stepsize schedules (dubbed slingshot stepsize schedules) that are time-varying, asymmetric, and periodically negative. We show that all three properties are necessary for convergence, and that altogether this enables GDA to converge on the classical counterexamples (e.g., unconstrained convex-concave problems). All of our results apply to the last iterate of GDA, as is typically desired in practice.
  The core algorithmic intuition is that although negative stepsizes make backward progress, they de-synchronize the min and max variables (overcoming the cycling issue of GDA), and lead to a slingshot phenomenon in which the forward progress in the other iterations is overwhelmingly larger. This results in fast overall convergence. Geometrically, the slingshot dynamics leverage the non-reversibility of gradient flow: positive/negative steps cancel to first order, yielding a second-order net movement in a new direction that leads to convergence and is otherwise impossible for GDA to move in. We interpret this as a second-order finite-differencing algorithm and show that, intriguingly, it approximately implements consensus optimization, an empirically popular algorithm for min-max problems involving deep neural networks (e.g., training GANs)."

This notion can be naturally extended to first-order formulae in the language of groups. We consider this more general setting and establish conciseness for various classes of groups and formulae. We prove that all formulae are concise in the class of abelian groups and that every existential formula is concise in the class of torsion-free locally class-2 nilpotent groups. In addition, we construct new examples of weakly rational words, which allow us to produce a wide variety of formulae that are concise in the class of residually finite groups."

Moreover, this is true even if we allow a parameter $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $C$ and its complement have scales that are $\mbox{OD}$ and universally Baire. We also investigate whether $(Σ^2_1)^{\mbox{uB}}$ statements are upwards absolute from $\mbox{HOD}$ to $V$ under large cardinal hypotheses, observing that this is true if $\mbox{HOD}$ has a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Finally, we discuss $(\forall^{\mathbb{R}})\, (Σ^2_1)^{\mbox{uB}}$ absoluteness and conclude that this much absoluteness between $\mbox{HOD}$ and $V$ cannot be implied by any large cardinal axiom consistent with the axiom ``$V =$ Ultimate $L$''."

We also prove that the space of leaf closures of a Killing foliation of a compact manifold is the Gromov--Hausdorff limit of a sequence of orbifolds. This, in turn, enables us to prove that a transversely quarter-pinched, complete Riemannian foliation of a connected manifold, with codimension greater than or equal to 3, develops on the universal cover to a fibration over a sphere."

This problem is formalized as the estimation of the best, in a certain sense, linear combinations of the features that are relevant to the response variable. Importantly, the dependence between the features and the response is allowed to be arbitrary. Necessary and sufficient conditions for such parsimonious identification -- referred to as statistical interpretability -- are established for a broad class of linear dimensionality reduction algorithms. Sharp bounds on their estimation errors, with high probability, are derived. To our knowledge, this is the first formal framework that enables the definition and assessment of the interpretability of a broad class of algorithms. The results are specifically applied to methods based on sparse regression, unsupervised projection and sufficient reduction. The implications of employing such methods for prediction problems are discussed in the context of the prolific literature on overparametrized methods in the regime of benign overfitting."

  We give an algorithm to compute a basis of $Z (L)$ as a $C [L]$-module. Our approach combines results by K. Goodearl in 1985 with solving the systems of equations of the stationary Gelfand-Dickey (GD) hierarchy, which after substituting the coefficients of $L$ become linear, and whose solution sets form a flag of constants. We are assuming that the coefficients of $L$ belong to a differential algebraic extension $K$ of $C$.

Those surfaces form four families: (ideal) polygons, once-punctured polygons, one-holed polygons (or ``crowns''), and Möbius strips with spikes.

This provides an explicit way to realize dual bases for the classical polarity pairing, and also yields known results on determinantal representations of Appell sequences of polynomials.

2505.01258,A Provably Convergent Plug-and-Play Framework for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization,"['math.OC', 'cs.LG']","['Tianshu Chu', 'Dachuan Xu', 'Wei Yao', 'Chengming Yu', 'Jin Zhang']","Bilevel optimization has recently attracted significant attention in machine learning due to its wide range of applications and advanced hierarchical optimization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, named PnPBO, for developing and analyzing stochastic bilevel optimization methods. This framework integrates both modern unbiased and biased stochastic estimators into the single-loop bilevel optimization framework introduced in [9], with several improvements. In the implementation of PnPBO, all stochastic estimators for different variables can be independently incorporated, and an additional moving average technique is applied when using an unbiased estimator for the upper-level variable. In the theoretical analysis, we provide a unified convergence and complexity analysis for PnPBO, demonstrating that the adaptation of various stochastic estimators (including PAGE, ZeroSARAH, and mixed strategies) within the PnPBO framework achieves optimal sample complexity, comparable to that of single-level optimization. This resolves the open question of whether the optimal complexity bounds for solving bilevel optimization are identical to those for single-level optimization. Finally, we empirically validate our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness on several benchmark problems and confirming our theoretical findings."
2505.01253,On homomorphisms from finite subgroups of $SU(2)$ to Langlands dual pairs of groups,"['math.RT', 'hep-th', 'math.GR']","['Yuki Kojima', 'Yuji Tachikawa']","Let $N(Γ,G)$ be the number of homomorphisms from $Γ$ to $G$ up to conjugation by $G$. Physics of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories predicts that $N(Γ,G)=N(Γ, \tilde G)$ when $Γ$ is a finite subgroup of $SU(2)$, $G$ is a connected compact simple Lie group and $\tilde G$ is its Langlands dual. This statement is known to be true when $Γ=\mathbb{Z}_n$, but the statement for non-Abelian $Γ$ is new, to the knowledge of the authors. To lend credence to this conjecture, we prove this equality in a couple of examples, namely $(G,\tilde G)=(SU(n),PU(n))$ and $(Sp(n),SO(2n+1))$ for arbitrary $Γ$, and $(PSp(n),Spin(2n+1))$ for exceptional $Γ$. A more refined version of the conjecture, together with proofs of some concrete cases, will also be presented. The authors would like to ask mathematicians to provide a more uniform proof applicable to all cases."
2505.01248,Almost Global Solutions of Kirchhoff Equation,['math.AP'],"['Jianjun Liu', 'Duohui Xiang']","This paper is concerned with the original Kirchhoff equation $$\left\{\begin{aligned}

  \\&u(t,0)=u(t,π)=0. \end{aligned}\right.$$ We obtain almost global existence and stability of solutions for almost any small initial data of size $\varepsilon$. In Sobolev spaces, the time of existence and stability is of order $\varepsilon^{-r}$ for arbitrary positive integer $r$. In Gevrey and analytic spaces, the time is of order $e^{\frac{|\ln\varepsilon|^2}{c\ln|\ln\varepsilon|}}$ with some positive constant $c$. To achieve these, we build rational normal form for infinite dimensional reversible vector fields without external parameters. We emphasize that for vector fields, the homological equation and the definition of rational normal form are significantly different from those for Hamiltonian functions."

We first formulate the involved Least Squares (LS) problem and discuss the need for regularization, indicating a connection between the typically employed $l_2$ regularization and the stability of the inferred discrete-time sFOM. We then provide theoretical insights considering the consistency and stability properties of the inferred numerical schemes that form the sFOM and exemplify them via illustrative, 1D test cases of linear diffusion and linear advection. For linear advection, we analytically derive a ""sampling CFL"" condition, which dictates a bound for the ratio of spatial and temporal discretization steps in the training data that ensures stability of the inferred sFOM. Finally, we investigate the sFOM inference for two nonlinear problems, namely a 2D Burgers' test case and the incompressible flow in an oscillating lid driven cavity, and draw connections between the theoretical findings and the properties of the inferred, nonlinear sFOMs."

This behavior depends in particular on two numerical invariants that measure, on one hand, certain properties of the centralizers in $\mathfrak g$ of the ideals in the lower central sequence and, on the other hand, the dimension of the largest abelian ideal that appears in the lower central series. We give examples proving that the Hilbert polynomial can distinguish isomorphism classes of filiform Lie algebras that cannot be distinguished by the two aforementioned invariants."

However, finding this cone or even proving its existence/non-existence is hard. This problem is known to be algorithmically undecidable for general sets of matrices. We show that it can nevertheless be efficiently solved in practice. An algorithm that for a given finite set of matrices, either finds a common invariant cone or proves its non-existence is presented. Numerical results demonstrate that it works for a vast majority of matrix sets. The structure and properties of the minimal and maximal invariant cones are analyzed. Applications to dynamical systems and combinatorics are considered."

Furthermore, we obtain a Jarník-type refinement of our main result, which uses Hausdorff measures. The results are also obtained in the inhomogeneous setting. The proofs are underpinned by a sharper version of a `quantitative nondivergence' result of Bernik--Kleinbock--Margulis and a duality argument which we use to study rational points near manifolds."
2505.01226,Discovering Mechanistic Causality from Time Series: A Behavioral-System Approach,['math.OC'],"['Yingzhu Liu', 'Shengyuan Huang', 'Zhongkui Li', 'Xiaoguang Yang', 'Wenjun Mei']","Identifying ``true causality'' is a fundamental challenge in complex systems research. Widely adopted methods, like the Granger causality test, capture statistical dependencies between variables rather than genuine driver-response mechanisms. This critical gap stems from the absence of mathematical tools that reliably reconstruct underlying system dynamics from observational time-series data. In this paper, we introduce a new control-based method for causality discovery through the behavior-system theory, which represents dynamical systems via trajectory spaces and has been widely used in data-driven control. Our core contribution is the \textbf{B}ehavior-\textbf{e}nabled \textbf{Caus}ality test (the BeCaus test), which transforms causality discovery into solving fictitious control problems. By exploiting the intrinsic asymmetry between system inputs and outputs, the proposed method operationalizes our conceptualization of mechanistic causality: variable $X$ is a cause of $Y$ if $X$ (partially) drives the evolution of $Y$. We establish conditions for linear time-invariant systems to be causality-discoverable, i.e., conditions for the BeCaus test to distinguish four basic causal structures (independence, full causality, partial causality, and latent-common-cause relation). Notably, our approach accommodates open systems with unobserved inputs. Moreover, an exploratory case study indicates the new method's potential extensibility to nonlinear systems."

2505.01205,The negative $σ$-moment generating function,"['math.RT', 'math.NT']",['Sean Howe'],"For $X$ a pre-$λ$ random variable, we show the $σ$-moment generating function of $-X$ can be obtained from the $σ$-moment generating function of $X$ by applying the composition of the standard and degree flip involutions on symmetric power series. This isometric involution is natural as it preserves the pre-$λ$ ring structure on symmetric power series with pre-$λ$ coefficients, thus this formula provides a simple description of the $σ$-moment generating function of $-X$ whenever the $σ$-moment generating function of $X$ has a simple description using the pre-$λ$ structure. As an application we compute, in a natural range, the dimensions of orthogonal and symplectic group invariants in tensor products of exterior powers of their standard representations on $\mathbb{C}^n$. We also compute a generating function for stable traces of Frobenius related to the moment conjecture for prime-order function field Dirichlet characters."

We show that the coordinate ring of any affine embedding of $G_k/K_k$ admits a dual canonical basis.
  We further construct an integral model for the canonical embedding (that is, an embedding which is complete, simple, and toroidal) of $G_k/K_k$. When $G_k$ is of adjoint type, we obtain an integral model for the wonderful compactification of the symmetric space."

Such problems are of major importance in engineering and sciences as it appears in control theory, fluid and gas dynamics, financial modelling and so on. Solutions of such problems exhibit boundary and/or interior layers, which make them difficult to handle. It has been validated in the literature that standard PINNs have low accuracy and can't handle such problems efficiently. Recently Cao et. al \cite{cao2023physics} proposed a new parameter asymptotic PINNs (PA-PINNs) to solve one-parameter singularly perturbed convection-dominated problems. It was observed that PA-PINNs works better than standard PINNs and gPINNs in terms of accuracy, convergence and stability. In this article, for the first time robustness of PA-PINNs will be validated for solving two-parameter SPPs."

Furthermore, we establish the Anderson Hartree NLS as an effective equation describing many-body Bosonic systems and, in particular, we prove the convergence of the linear Schrödinger equation for the many body system to the BBGKY hierarchy for the Coulomb interaction."

2505.01148,The class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ and mixture distributions with dominated continuous singular parts,['math.PR'],['A. A. Khartov'],"We consider a new class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ of distribution functions $F$ that have the property of rational-infinite divisibility: there exist some infinitely divisible distribution functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ such that $F_1=F*F_2$. A distribution function of the class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ is quasi-infinitely divisible in the sense that its characteristic function admits the Lévy-type representation with a ``signed spectral measure''. This class is a wide natural extension of the fundamental class of infinitely divisible distribution functions and it is actively studied now. We are interested in conditions for a distribution function $F$ to belong to the class $\boldsymbol{Q}$ for the unexplored case, where $F$ may have a continuous singular part. We propose a criterion under the assumption that the continuous singular part of $F$ is dominated by the discrete part in a certain sense. The criterion generalizes the previous results by Alexeev and Khartov for discrete probability laws and the results by Berger and Kutlu for the mixtures of discrete and absolutely continuous laws. In addition, we describe the characteristic triplet of the corresponding Lévy-type representation, which may contain some continuous singular part. We also show that the assumption of the dominated continuous singular part cannot be simply omitted or even slightly extended (without some special assumptions). We apply the general criterion to some interesting particular examples. We also positively solve the decomposition problem stated by Lindner, Pan and Sato within the considered case."

Despite its intuitive appeal, its theoretical justification remains unsatisfying because its benefits of improving efficiency for estimating the average treatment effect diminish if we use regression adjustment in the analysis stage. To strengthen the theory of rerandomization, we show that it mitigates false discoveries resulting from $p$-hacking, the practice of strategically selecting covariates to get more significant $p$-values. Moreover, we show that rerandomization with a sufficiently stringent threshold can resolve $p$-hacking. As a byproduct, our theory offers guidance for choosing the threshold in rerandomization in practice."
2505.01131,New optima for the deletion shadow,['math.CO'],['Benedict Randall Shaw'],"For a family $\mathcal{F}$ of words of length $n$ drawn from an alphabet $A=[r]=\{1,\dots,r\}$, Danh and Daykin defined the deletion shadow $Δ\mathcal{F}$ as the family containing all words that can be made by deleting one letter of a word of $\mathcal{F}$. They asked, given the size of such a family, how small its deletion shadow can be, and answered this with a Kruskal-Katona type result when the alphabet has size $2$. However, Leck showed that no ordering can give such a result for larger alphabets. The minimal shadow has been known for families of size $s^n$, where the optimal family has form $[s]^n$. We give the minimal shadow for many intermediate sizes between these levels, showing that families of the form 'all words in $[s]^n$ in which the symbol $s$ appears at most $k$ times' are optimal. Our proof uses some fractional techniques that may be of independent interest."

After a study of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator, it is investigated when planar strips and sections of circular cylinders are stable in cylindrical symmetric support surfaces. This analysis depends on the curvature of the support at the contact points with the interface. The Plateau-Rayleigh instability phenomenon is studied finding the critical value $h_0>0$ such that rectangular pieces of planar strips or circular cylinders of length greater than $h_0$ are necessarily unstable. It is also studied when new morphologies of capillary surfaces can emerge from given circular cylinders. Using the method of bifurcation by simple eigenvalues, we establish conditions on the support surface that prove that when $0$ is a simple eigenvalue of the Jacobi operator, there is bifurcation from explicit circular cylinders. It will be presented examples of supports (parabolic and catenary cylinders) where this bifurcation appears."

2505.01082,Screening Cut Generation for Sparse Ridge Regression,['math.OC'],"['Haozhe Tan', 'Guanyi Wang']","Sparse ridge regression is widely utilized in modern data analysis and machine learning. However, computing globally optimal solutions for sparse ridge regression is challenging, particularly when samples are arbitrarily given or generated under weak modeling assumptions. This paper proposes a novel cut-generation method, Screening Cut Generation (SCG), to eliminate non-optimal solutions for arbitrarily given samples. In contrast to recent safe variable screening approaches, SCG offers superior screening capability by identifying whether a specific $\{\pm 1\}$ combination of multiple features (binaries) lies in the set of optimal solutions. This identification is based on a convex relaxation solution rather than directly solving the original sparse ridge regression. Hence, the cuts generated by SCG can be applied in the pre-processing step of branch-and-bound and its variants to construct safe outer approximations of the optimal solution set. Numerical experiments are reported to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of SCG, particularly in hard real instances and synthetic instances with high dimensions, low ridge regularization parameters, or challenging modeling assumptions."

2505.01021,On the number of components of twisted torus links,['math.GT'],"['Adnan', 'Thiago de Paiva', 'Kyungbae Park']","Twisted torus links $T(p,q;r,s)$ generalize torus links by introducing $s$ additional twists on $r$ adjacent strands of the torus link $T(p,q)$. It is well known that the number of components of a torus link $T(p, q)$ is given by the greatest common divisor of $p$ and $q$. However, determining the number of components of twisted torus links is not as straightforward based solely on their parameters. In this work, we present a Euclidean algorithm-like procedure for computing the number of components of twisted torus links based on their parameters. As a result, we show that the number of components of a twisted torus link $T(p, q; r, s)$ is a multiple of $\gcd(p, q, r, s)$, and in particular, $T(p, q; r, s)$ is a knot only if $\gcd(p, q, r, s) = 1$. We also use our algorithm to prove several conjectures related to the number of components in twisted torus links."
2505.01018,Explicit images for the Shimura Correspondence,['math.NT'],"['Matthew Boylan', 'Swati']","In 2014, Yang showed that for $F \in \mathcal{A}_{r, s, 1, 1_N}$, we have $\textup{Sh}_{r}(F \mid V_{24}) = G \otimes χ_{12}$ where $G\in S^{new}_{r+2s - 1}(Γ_{0}(6), - \left( \frac{8}{r} \right), - \left( \frac{12}{r} \right))$, where $\textup{Sh}_{r}$ is the $r$-th Shimura lift associated to the theta-multiplier. He proved a similar result for $(r,6) = 3$.\:His proofs rely on trace computations in integral and half-integral weights.
  In this paper, we provide a constructive proof of Yang's result. We obtain explicit formulas for $\mathcal{S}_{r}(F)$, the $r$-th Shimura lift associated to the eta-multiplier defined by Ahlgren, Andersen, and Dicks, when $1\leq r\leq 23$ is odd and $N = 1$. We also obtain formulas for lifts of Hecke eigenforms multiplied by theta-function eta-quotients and lifts of Rankin-Cohen brackets of Hecke eigenforms with theta-function eta-quotients."
2505.01011,On calculation of canonical decomposition of Tensor via the grid of local discrepancies,['math.NA'],"['A. K. Alekseev', 'A. E. Bondarev', 'Y. S.

It is based on the replacement of the approximation error norm (global discrepancy functional) by the grid of local functionals (discrepancies computed on hyperplanes). The point of the global functional minimum in the space of the canonical decomposition cores is determined by the set of the stationary points of local functionals. In result, the estimation of the cores of the canonical decomposition is possible using Newton method applied point-wisely along coordinates and nodes. The discrepancies on the hyperplanes are calculated using Monte-Carlo method. Numerical tests on the approximation of sixth order tensors confirms the efficiency of the proposed approach."

The primary focus is on space-time non-local equations where the spatial operator is the infinitesimal generator of a vector of independent subordinate Brownian motions, making it the sum of subdimensional non-local operators. A representative example of such an operator is $(Δ_{x})^{β_{1}/2}+(Δ_{y})^{β_{2}/2}$. We establish existence, uniqueness, and precise estimates for solutions in corresponding Sobolev spaces. Due to singularities arising in the Fourier transforms of our operators, traditional methods involving Fourier analysis are not directly applicable. Instead, we employ a probabilistic approach to derive solution estimates. Additionally, we identify the optimal initial data space using generalized real interpolation theory."

Elliott']","In this paper, we prove results on the relative radius of comparison of C*-algebras and their crossed products, focusing on the non-unital setting. More precisely, let $A$ be a stably finite simple non-type-I (not necessarily unital) C*-algebra, let $G$ be a finite group, and let $α\colon G \to {\operatorname{Aut}} (A)$ be an action which has the weak tracial Rokhlin property. Let $a$ be a non-zero positive element in $A^α\otimes \mathcal{K}$. Then we show that the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A^α)$ relative to $[a]$ is bounded above by the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A)$ relative to $[a]$. If further $A$ is exact and $a$ is in the Pedersen ideal of $A^α\otimes \mathcal{K}$, then the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A\rtimes_α G)$ relative to $[a]$ is equal to its radius of comparison relative to $[p\cdot a]$, scaled by $1/|G|$, where $p$ is the averaging projection in the multiplier algebra of $(A \otimes \mathcal{K}) \rtimes_{α\otimes \operatorname{id}} G$. Moreover, the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A\rtimes_α G)$ relative to $[a]$ is bounded above by $1/|G|$ times the radius of comparison of $\operatorname{Cu} (A)$ relative to $[a]$. We also prove that the inclusion of $A^α$ in $A$ induces an isomorphism from the purely positive part of the Cuntz semigroup ${\operatorname{Cu}} (A^α)$ to the fixed point of the purely positive part of ${\operatorname{Cu}} (A)$. An important consequence of our results is that they apply to non-unital C*-algebras and give new insights into comparison theory of C*-algebras and their crossed products."

In this way, we obtain lower bounds on the smallest dimension ${\rm{FixDim}}(Γ)+1$ in which various groups of geometric interest can act on a complete CAT$(0)$ space without a global fixed point.

Tibshirani']","Accurately forecasting the probability distribution of phenomena of interest is a classic and ever more widespread goal in statistics and decision theory. In comparison to point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts aim to provide a more complete and informative characterization of the target variable. This endeavor is only fruitful, however, if a forecast is ""close"" to the distribution it attempts to predict. The role of a loss function -- also known as a scoring rule -- is to make this precise by providing a quantitative measure of proximity between a forecast distribution and target random variable. Numerous loss functions have been proposed in the literature, with a strong focus on proper losses, that is, losses whose expectations are minimized when the forecast distribution is the same as the target. In this paper, we show that a broad class of proper loss functions penalize asymmetrically, in the sense that underestimating a given parameter of the target distribution can incur larger loss than overestimating it, or vice versa. Our theory covers many popular losses, such as the logarithmic, continuous ranked probability, quadratic, and spherical losses, as well as the energy and threshold-weighted generalizations of continuous ranked probability loss. To complement our theory, we present experiments with real epidemiological, meteorological, and retail forecast data sets. Further, as an implication of the loss asymmetries revealed by our work, we show that hedging is possible under a setting of distribution shift."

It is well-known that the relation $\{(M,N) : M \leq_αN\}$ is (lightface) $Π^0_{2α}$. We show that this is optimal as the set is $\mathbfΠ^0_{2α}$-complete. We are also interested in the one-sided relations $\{ N : M \leq_αN\}$ and $\{ N : M \geq_αN\}$ for a fixed $M$, measuring the $Π_α$ and $Σ_α$ types of $M$. We show that these sets are always $\mathbfΠ^0_{α+ 2}$ and $\mathbfΠ^0_{α+3}$ respectively, and that for most $α$ there are structures $M$ for which these relations are complete at that level. In particular, there are structures $M$ such that there is no $Π_α$ (or even $Π_{α+1})$ sentence $\varphi$ such that $N \models \varphi \Longleftrightarrow M \leq_αN$.
  This is unfortunate as not all $Π_{α+2}$ sentences are preserved under $\leq_α$. We define a new hierarchy of syntactic complexity closely related to the back-and-forth game, which can both define the back-and-forth types as well as be preserved by them. These hierarchies of formulas have already been useful in certain Henkin constructions, one of which we give in this paper, and another previously used by Gonzalez and Harrison-Trainor to show that every $Π_α$ theory of linear orders has a model with Scott rank at most $α+3$."

Based on this observation, we introduce a notion of generic realizations for polytopes and conjecture that convex polytopes are generically rigid in dimension $d\geq 3$. We prove this conjecture in dimension $d=3$. Motivated by our findings we also pose several questions that are intended to inspire future research into this notion of polytope rigidity."

The objective is to maximize the overall platoon revenue of the fleet while accounting for the associated waiting and charging costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and present a dynamic programming approach to compute its sub-optimal solution efficiently. The proposed method operates in polynomial time, ensuring scalable computational efficiency. Simulation studies involving 1,000 trucks traveling between two hubs in Sweden demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach."

2505.00838,A stabilized march approach to adjoint-based sensitivity analysis of chaotic flows,"['math.NA', 'math.OC']","['Pranshul Thakur', 'Siva Nadarajah']","Adjoint-based sensitivity analysis is of interest in computational science due to its ability to compute sensitivities at a lower cost with respect to several design parameters. However, conventional sensitivity analysis methods fail in the presence of chaotic flows. Popular approaches to chaotic sensitivity analysis of flows involve the use of the shadowing trajectory. The state-of-the-art approach computes the shadowing trajectory by solving a least squares minimization problem, resulting in a space-time linear system of equations. The current paper computes the adjoint shadowing trajectory using the stabilized march, by specifying the adjoint boundary conditions instead of solving a minimization problem. This approach results in a space-time linear system that can be solved through a single backward substitution of order $\mathcal{O}(n_u^2)$ with $n_u$ being the dimension of the unstable subspace. It is proven to compute sensitivities that converge to the true sensitivity for large integration times and that the error in the sensitivity due to the discretization is of the order of the local truncation error of the scheme. The approach is numerically verified on the Lorentz 63 and Kuramoto-Sivasinsky equations."
2505.00833,On The Relative Cohomology For Algebraic Groups,"['math.GR', 'math.RT']",['Gabriel T. Loos'],"Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$, and $M$ and $N$ be $G$-modules. In 1961, Hochschild showed how one can define the cohomology groups $\text{Ext}_{G}^{i}(M,N)$. Kimura, in 1965, showed that one can generalize this to get relative cohomology for algebraic groups. The original cohomology groups play an important role in understanding the representation theory of $G$, but the role of relative cohomology is still not well understood.
  In this paper the author expands upon the work of Kimura to prove foundational results about the relative cohomology. The author starts by giving the definitions of relative exact sequences and relative injective modules and proves a variety of basic properties for each that will be essential to define relative cohomology and obtain a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence. In particular, the induction functor will play an important role when studying the relative injective modules. Once the necessary ground work is laid, the definition of relative cohomology is given. Finally, it is stated when there is a relative Grothendieck spectral sequence, and many consequences and examples are provided."

These are defined using the splitting distance which is calculated using the distance in a simplicial complex associated with the splitting surface arising from the Heegard decompositions of the 3-manifold. We prove that the splitting distances in each case is bounded from below under stabilizations and as a result the associated invariants converge to a non-trivial limit under stabilizations."
2505.00809,New Smoothness Indicator Within an Active Flux Framework,['math.NA'],"['Alina Chertock', 'Alexander Kurganov', 'Lorenzo Micalizzi']","In this work, we introduce a new smoothness indicator (SI), which is capable of detecting ``rough'' parts of the solutions computed by active flux (AF) methods for hyperbolic (systems of) conservation laws. The new SI is based on measuring the difference between the two sets of solutions (either cell averages and point values or cell averages on overlapping grids) evolved at each time step of AF methods. The key idea in the derivation of the new SI is that in the ``rough'' parts of the evolved solutions, the difference is ${\cal O}(1)$, while in the smooth areas, it is proportional to the order of the underlying AF method. The performance of the new SI, that is, its ability to automatically and robustly detect ``rough'' parts of the computed solutions, is illustrated on several numerical examples, in which the one-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics are numerically solved by a recently introduced semi-discrete finite-volume AF method on overlapping grids."

We show that, however, there exist many instances of such defining functions for which only the zero function has finite Ohsawa norm, so that the $L^2$ extension statement is void in such cases, even when it has a unique log canonical place. Such a defining function occurs already among some of the simplest non-analytic singularities, namely toric ones."

This connected various examples coming from disparate fields which exhibit near-modular behavior. In the fifteen years since, Zagier's philosophy has informed new developments in areas such as knot theory, 3-dimensional topology, combinatorics, and physics. More recently, the concept of holomorphic quantum modularity has emerged, pointing to a clearer structure for Zagier's original examples. These new developments suggest connections to perturbative quantum field theory, like the theory of resurgence. In 2024, Fantini and Rella proposed a means of codifying some of these connections under their program of ``modular resurgence.""
  Inspired by their work, we unify all of the examples of quantum modular forms in Zagier's original paper under the umbrella of resurgence. In doing so, we strengthen known quantum modularity results for holomorphic Eichler integrals of half-integer weight modular forms. Our main addition to the literature is a collection of median resummation type results which show that the examples of holomorphic quantum modular forms we consider can be recovered from their asymptotics, or the asymptotics of closely related functions."

The novelty of our approach is twofold. First, we introduce an original paradigm making use of overlapping finite-volume (FV) meshes over which cell averages of conservative and primitive variables are evolved using semi-discrete FV methods: The nonconservative system is discretized by a path-conservative central-upwind scheme, and its solution is used to evaluate very simple numerical fluxes for the discretization of the original conservative system. Second, to ensure the nonlinear stability of the resulting method, we design a post-processing, which also guarantees a conservative coupling between the two sets of variables. We test the proposed semi-discrete dual formulation finite-volume methods on several benchmarks for the Euler equations of gas dynamics."

In applications, these systems are usually defined with a set of tunable parameters and as the parameters are varied the system response undergoes significant topological changes or bifurcations. In a high dimensional parameter space, it is difficult to determine which direction to vary the system parameters to achieve a desired system response or state. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for optimally navigating a dynamical system parameter space that is rooted in topological data analysis. Specifically we use the differentiability of persistence diagrams to define a topological language for intuitively promoting or deterring different topological features in the state space response of a dynamical system and use gradient descent to optimally move from one point in the parameter space to another. The end result is a path in this space that guides the system to a set of parameters that yield the desired topological features defined by the loss function. We show a number of examples by applying the methods to different dynamical systems and scenarios to demonstrate how to promote different features and how to choose the hyperparameters to achieve different outcomes."

2505.00726,Non-commuting graphs of projective spaces over central quotients of Lie algebras,['math.RA'],['Songpon Sriwongsa'],"Let $L$ be a finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra with the center $Z(L)$. In this paper, we define a non-commuting graph associated with $L$ as the graph whose vertex set is the projective space of the quotient algebra $L/Z(L)$, and two vertices $span \{ x + Z(L) \}$ and $span \{ y + Z(L) \}$ are adjacent if $x$ and $y$ do not commute under the Lie bracket of $L$. We present several theoretical properties of this graph. For certain classes of Lie algebras, we show that if the non-commuting graphs from two Lie algebras are isomorphic, then these Lie algebras themselves must be isomorphic. Furthermore, we discuss a relation between graph isomorphisms between non-commuting graphs of Lie algebras over finite fields and the size of the algebras."
2505.00724,Optimal Blackjack Betting Strategies Through Dynamic Programming and Expected Utility Theory,"['math.OC', 'econ.TH']","['Lucas Bordeu', 'Javier Castro']","This study presents a rigorous mathematical approach to the optimization of round and betting policies in Blackjack, using Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Expected Utility Theory. The analysis considers a direct confrontation between a player and the dealer, simplifying the dynamics of the game. The objective is to develop optimal strategies that maximize expected utility for risk profiles defined by constant (CRRA) and absolute (CARA) aversion utility functions. Dynamic programming algorithms are implemented to estimate optimal gambling and betting policies with different levels of complexity. The evaluation is performed through simulations, analyzing histograms of final returns. The results indicate that the advantage of applying optimized round policies over the ""basic strategy"" is slight, highlighting the efficiency of the last one. In addition, betting strategies based on the exact composition of the deck slightly outperform the Hi-Lo counting system, showing its effectiveness. The optimized strategies include versions suitable for mental use in physical environments and more complex ones requiring computational processing. Although the computed strategies approximate the theoretical optimal performance, this study is limited to a specific configuration of rules. As a future challenge, it is proposed to explore strategies under other game configurations, considering additional players or deeper penetration of the deck, which could pose new technical challenges."

We study of its fundamental properties, including convergence and Cauchy sequences that establishes a solid theoretical foundation. A significant highlight of our work is the formulation of Suzuki-type fixed point theorem within this framework which extends classical results in a meaningful way. To demonstrate the depth and applicability of our findings, we construct non-trivial examples that illustrate the behavior of key concepts. Moreover, as a practical application, we apply our main theorem to analyze an economic growth model, demonstrating its utility in solving fractional differential equations that arise in dynamic economic systems."

2505.00715,Comparison of FMM and $\mathcal{H}$-matrix based 3D-ACA for a time domain boundary element method,['math.NA'],"['Martin Schanz', 'Vibudha Lakshmi Keshava', 'Herbert de Gersem']","The time domain Boundary Element Method (BEM) for the homogeneous wave equation with vanishing initial conditions is considered. For the temporal discretisation, the generalized convolution quadrature method (gCQ) developed by Lopez-Fernandez and Sauter is used. The spatial discretisation is done classically using low-order shape functions.
  Essentially, the gCQ requires to establish boundary element matrices of the corresponding elliptic problem in Laplace domain at several complex frequencies. Consequently, an array of system matrices is obtained. This array of system matrices can be interpreted as a three-dimensional array of data which should be approximated by a data-sparse representation, for which the generalised Adaptive Cross Approximation (3D-ACA) can be applied. The rank of the three-dimensional data array is increased adaptively until a prescribed accuracy is obtained. On a pure algebraic level, it is decided whether a low-rank approximation of the three-dimensional data array is close enough to the original matrix. Within the data slices corresponding to the BEM calculations for each frequency, either the standard $\mathcal{H}$-matrices approach with ACA or a fast multipole (FMM) approach can be used. The third dimension of the data array represents the complex frequencies. Hence, the algorithm does not only sparsify the data array in the two spatial dimensions but also adaptively detects how much frequencies are necessary for which matrix block.
  he two versions, either using ACA or FMM within the slices, are briefly discussed. The main contribution of this paper is a comparison of both with respect to savings in storage and computing time. The example of the sound scattering of an electric machine shows that both techniques allow to utilise a time-domain BEM in real-world problems."
2505.00713,Partial integration based regularization in BEM for 3D elastostatic problems: The role of line integrals,['math.NA'],"['Vibudha Lakshmi Keshava', 'Martin Schanz']","The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is a powerful numerical approach for solving 3D elastostatic problems, particularly useful for crack propagation in fracture mechanics and half-space problems. A key challenge in BEM lies in handling singular integral kernels. Various analytical and numerical integration or regularization techniques address this, including one that combines partial integration with Stokes' theorem to reduce hyper-singular and strong singular kernels to weakly singular ones. This approach typically assumes a closed surface, omitting the boundary integrals from Stokes' theorem. In this paper, these usually neglected boundary line integrals are introduced and their significance is demonstrated, first in a pure half-space problem, and then shown to be redundant in fast multipole method (FMM) based BEM, where geometry partitioning produces pseudo open surfaces."
2505.00712,A Goal-Oriented Adaptive Sampling Procedure for Projection-Based Reduced-Order Models with Hyperreduction,['math.NA'],"['Calista Biondic', 'Siva Nadarajah']","Projection-based reduced-order models (PROMs) have demonstrated accuracy, reliability, and robustness in approximating high-dimensional, differential equation-based computational models across many applications. For this reason, it has been proposed as a tool for high-querying parametric design problems like those arising in modern aircraft design. Since aerodynamic simulations can be computationally expensive, PROMs offer the potential for more rapid estimations of high-fidelity solutions. However, the efficiency can still be tied to the dimension of the full-order model (FOM), particularly when projected quantities must be frequently recomputed due to non-linearities or parameter dependence. In the case of Petrov-Galerkin models, the projected residual and Jacobian are re-evaluated at every Newton iteration, thereby limiting the anticipated cost improvements. Hyperreduction is one of the tools available to approximate these quantities and address this issue. This work tests the energy-conserving sampling and weighting (ECSW) method as a potential approach for hyperreduction. It will be incorporated into the work in a previous article {10.1016/j.compfluid.2025.106568} which had developed an adaptive sampling procedure for building a reduced-order model (ROM) with a controlled functional error. The impacts of hyperreduction on computational cost and accuracy will be studied using the NACA0012 airfoil."

The proposed approach enables the construction of ROM bases with minimal additional computational cost. By exploiting Fr{é}chet derivatives -solution to the same problem with distinct right-hand sides -the method introduces a streamlined multiple-right-hand-side (RHS) strategy for ROM bases construction. This approach not only reduces overall computational expenses but also improves accuracy during model parameter updates. Numerical experiments on a two-dimensional wave problem demonstrate significant efficiency gains and enhanced performance, highlighting the potential of the proposed method to advance computational cost-effectiveness, particularly in seismic inversion applications."
2505.00708,Numerical Approaches for non-local Transport-Dominated PDE Models with Applications to Biology,['math.NA'],"['Johan Marguet', 'Raluca Eftimie', 'Alexei Lozinski']","Transport-dominated partial differential equation models have been used extensively over the past two decades to describe various collective migration phenomena in cell biology and ecology. To understand the behaviour of these models (and the biological systems they describe) different analytical and numerical approaches have been used. While the analytical approaches have been discussed by different recent review studies, the numerical approaches are still facing different open problems, and thus are being employed on a rather ad-hoc basis for each developed non-local model. The goal of this review is to summarise the basic ideas behind these transport-dominated non-local models, to discuss the current numerical approaches used to simulate these models, and finally to discuss some open problems related to the applications of these numerical methods, in particular the finite element method. This allows us to emphasize the opportunities offered by this numerical method to advance the research in this field. In addition, we present in detail some numerical schemes that we used to discretize these non-local equations; in particular a new semi-implicit scheme we introduced to stabilize the oscillations obtained with classical schemes."

In the proposed high-order scheme we approximate the time derivative with piecewise polynomial interpolation of second-order and use the finite element discretization of piecewise polynomials of degree $d$ and $d+1$, where $d \geq 2$ is an integer, to approximate the space derivatives. The stability together with the error estimates of the constructed technique are established in $L^{\infty}(0,T;\text{\,}L^{2})$-norm. The analysis suggests that the developed computational technique is unconditionally stable, temporal second-order accurate and convergence in space of order $d+1$. Furthermore, the new approach is faster and more efficient than a broad range of numerical methods discussed in the literature for the given initial-boundary value problem. Some examples are carried out to confirm the theoretical results."

The technique is enhanced by a novel stabilization strategy, incorporating a Divergent Series Resummation (DSR) technique, which significantly augments the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The stabilization mechanism is meticulously designed to improve the stability and validity of computed series terms, enabling the application of the Factorial Series (FS) algorithm for series resummation. This approach is pivotal in addressing the challenges associated with the accurate and stable numerical solution of NS equations, which are critical in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications. The manuscript elaborates on the variational formulation of Stokes problem and present convergence analysis of the method using the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition. It is followed by the NS equations and the implementation details of the stabilization technique, underscored by numerical tests on laminar flow past a cylinder, showcasing the method's efficacy and potential for broad applicability in fluid dynamics simulations. The results of the stabilization indicate a substantial enhancement in computational stability and accuracy, offering a promising avenue for future research in the field."
2505.00699,Polynomial and rational matrices with the invariant rational functions and the four sequences of minimal indices prescribed,['math.SP'],"['Itziar Baragaña', 'Froilán M. Dopico', 'Silvia Marcaida', 'Alicia Roca']","The complete eigenstructure, or structural data, of a rational matrix $R(s)$ is comprised by its invariant rational functions, both finite and at infinity, which in turn determine its finite and infinite pole and zero structures, respectively, and by the minimal indices of its left and right null spaces. These quantities arise in many applications and have been thoroughly studied in numerous references. However, other two fundamental subspaces of $R(s)$ in contrast have received much less attention: the column and row spaces, which also have their associated minimal indices. This work solves the problems of finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of rational matrices in two scenarios: (a) when the invariant rational functions and the minimal indices of the column and row spaces are prescribed, and (b) when the complete eigenstructure together with the minimal indices of the column and row spaces are prescribed. The particular, but extremely important, cases of these problems for polynomial matrices are solved first and are the main tool for solving the general problems. The results in this work complete and non-trivially extend the necessary and sufficient conditions recently obtained for the existence of polynomial and rational matrices when only the complete eigenstructure is prescribed."
2505.00696,On the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture over function fields,"['math.NT', 'math.AG']",['Matt Broe'],"Let k be a field and X a smooth projective variety over k. When k is a number field, the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of X to the order of vanishing of certain L-functions. We consider the same conjecture when k is a global function field, and give a criterion for the conjecture to hold for X, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an application, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate conjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over function fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth projective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely generated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of Moonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over arbitrary fields."

Elkies conjectures that the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ are only cusps or CM points when $N$ is large enough. We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of non-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step toward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the existence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \leq g \leq 5$, when they are finite. In the process we identify exceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not known before."
2505.00672,On Minimal Generating Sets of Splitting Field and Cluster Towers,"['math.NT', 'math.AC', 'math.CO', 'math.GR']","['Shubham Jaiswal', 'P Vanchinathan']","The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme minimal cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). More generally, we establish that for a certain family of polynomials over the rationals, we have minimal generating sets of all cardinalities in a certain range and that these are the only possible cardinalities for minimal generating set for such a polynomial. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for this family of polynomials and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets. We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the first theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set."

Truncated Toeplitz operators have been effectively used to solve the inverse spectral problem when the spectral measure is a locally finite periodic measure (see \cite{MP}). Here, we reverse the inverse problem algorithm to solve the direct spectral problem for step-function Hamiltonians. For a non-step-function Hamiltonian, we consider its step-function approximations and their corresponding spectral measures, and show that these spectral measures converge to the spectral measure of the original Hamiltonian."

2505.00656,The local coupling of noise technique and its application to lower error bounds for strong approximation of SDEs with irregular coefficients,"['math.PR', 'math.NA']",['Simon Ellinger'],"In recent years, interest in approximation methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-Lipschitz continuous coefficients has increased. We show lower bounds for the $L^p$-error of such methods in the case of approximation at a single point in time or globally in time. On the one hand, we show that for a large class of piecewise Lipschitz continuous drifts and non-additive diffusions the best possible $L^p$-error rate for final time approximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $3/4$, which was previously known only for additive diffusions. Moreover, we show that the best $L^p$-error rate for global approximation that can be achieved by any method based on finitely many evaluations of the driving Brownian motion is at most $1/2$ when the drift is locally bounded and the diffusion is locally Lipschitz continuous.
  For the derivation of the lower bounds we introduce a new method of proof: the local coupling of noise technique. Using this technique when approximating a solution $X$ of the SDE at the final time, a lower bound for the $L^p$-error of any approximation method based on evaluations of the driving Brownian motion at the points $t_1 < \dots < t_n$ can be determined by the $L^p$-distances of solutions of the same SDE on $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$ with initial values $X_{t_{i-1}}$ and driving Brownian motions that are coupled at $t_{i-1}, t_i$ and independent, conditioned on the values of the Brownian motion at $t_{i-1}, t_i$."

This completely eliminates the dependency on Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture in previous works of Lichtman and the author, which built in turn on results of Maynard and Drappeau. We rely on recent large sieve inequalities for exceptional Maass forms of the author for additively-structured sequences, and on a related result of Watt for multiplicatively-structured sequences. As applications, we prove refined upper bounds for the counts of twin primes and consecutive smooth numbers up to $x$."
2505.00648,Adaptive Nonoverlapping Preconditioners for the Helmholtz Equation,['math.NA'],"['Yi Yu', 'Marcus Sarkis', 'Guanglian Li', 'Zhiwen Zhang']","The Helmholtz equation poses significant computational challenges due to its oscillatory solutions, particularly for large wavenumbers. Inspired by the Schur complement system for elliptic problems, this paper presents a novel substructuring approach to mitigate the potential ill-posedness of local Dirichlet problems for the Helmholtz equation. We propose two types of preconditioners within the framework of nonoverlapping spectral additive Schwarz (NOSAS) methods. The first type of preconditioner focuses on the real part of the Helmholtz problem, while the second type addresses both the real and imaginary components, providing a comprehensive strategy to enhance scalability and reduce computational cost. Our approach is purely algebraic, which allows for adaptability to various discretizations and heterogeneous Helmholtz coefficients while maintaining theoretical convergence for thresholds close to zero. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners, demonstrating robust convergence rates and scalability, even for large wavenumbers."

The well-known eight-dimensional Kac--Paljutkin algebra arises as the special case $H_{2,2}$, while the Hopf algebras previously constructed by Pansera correspond to the instances $H_{n,2}$. Each algebra $H_{n,m}$ is defined as an extension of the group algebra $\mathbb{K} Σ_m$ of the symmetric group by the $m$-fold tensor product $R = \mathbb{K} \mathbb{Z}_n^{\otimes m}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ denotes the cyclic group of order $n$. This extension admits a realization as a crossed product: $H_{n,m} = \mathbb{K} \mathbb{Z}_n^{\otimes m} \#_γΣ_m$.

The main goal of this article is to analyse the interacting particle system using the framework of regularity structures without applying the Gaertner transform, a discrete version of the Cole-Hopf transform which linearises the KPZ equation. Our analysis relies on discretisation framework for regularity structures developed by Erhard and Hairer as well as estimates for iterated integrals with respect to cadlag martingales derived by Grazieschi, Matetski and Weber. The main technical challenge addressed in this work is the renormalisation procedure which requires a subtle analysis of regularity preserving discrete convolution operators."

To this end, we introduce a parametric approach and consider a piecewise deterministic Markov process modeling both the evolution of the parameter, also called the trait, and the age of infection of individuals over time. At each new infection, a new trait is randomly chosen for the infected individual according to a Markov kernel, and their age is reset to zero. In the large population limit, we derive a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the density of traits and ages. The main goal is to study the conditions under which endemic equilibria exist for the deterministic PDE model and to establish an endemicity threshold that depends on the model parameters. The local stability of these equilibria is also analyzed. The endemicity threshold is computed for several examples, including models that incorporate a vaccination policy, and a local stability result is obtained for a memory-free SIS-type model."
2505.00594,Decomposing graphs into stable and ordered parts,"['math.CO', 'cs.LO', 'math.LO']","['Hector Buffière', 'Patrice Ossona de Mendez']","Connections between structural graph theory and finite model theory recently gained a lot of attention. In this setting, many interesting question remain on the properties of hereditary dependent (NIP) classes of graphs, in particular related to first-order transductions.
  Motivated by Simon's decomposition theorem of dependent types into a stable part and a distal (order-like) part, we conjecture that every hereditary dependent class of graphs is transduction-equivalent to a hereditary dependent class of partially ordered graphs, where the cover graph of the partial order has bounded treewidth and the unordered graph is (edge) stable.
  In this paper, we consider the first non-trivial case (classes with bounded linear cliquewidth) and prove that the conjecture holds in a strong form, where the cover graph of the partial order has bounded pathwidth. Then, we extend our study to classes that admit bounded-size bounded linear cliquewidth covers, and prove that the conjecture holds for these classes, too."

Let $\mathfrak{W}=\{w_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a bounded sequence of complex numbers. Define the operator $D_{\mathfrak{W}}: \ell^{p}\rightarrow\ell^{p}$ by, for any $x=(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots)\in \ell^p$, $π_{n}\circ D_{\mathfrak{W}}(x)=w_{n}x_{n}$ for all $n\geq1$. We call $D_{\mathfrak{W}}$ a diagonal operator on $\ell^{p}$. In this article, we study the topological conjugate classification of the diagonal operators on $\ell^{p}$. More precisely, we obtained the following results. $D_{\mathfrak{W}}$ and $D_{\vert\mathfrak{W}\vert}$ are topologically conjugate, where $\vert\mathfrak{W}\vert=\{\vert w_{n}\vert\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$. If $\inf_{n}\vert w_n\vert>1$, then $D_{\mathfrak{W}}$ is topologically conjugate to $2\mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ means the identity operator. Similarly, if $\inf_{n}\vert w_n\vert>0$ and $\sup_{n}\vert w_n\vert<1$, then $D_{\mathfrak{W}}$ is topologically conjugate to $\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{I}$.

However, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{R}$ and there is $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$, then $A =\mathbb{R}$.

Several other theorems on measurable, and especially Borel and analytic subgroups and subfields of the reals are presented. We also discuss some of these results in the $p$-adics."
2505.00548,Model order reduction of hemodynamics by space-time reduced basis and reduced fluid-structure interaction,['math.NA'],"['Riccardo Tenderini', 'Simone Deparis']","In this work, we apply the space-time Galerkin reduced basis (ST-GRB) method to a reduced fluid-structure interaction model, for the numerical simulation of hemodynamics in arteries. In essence, ST-GRB extends the classical reduced basis (RB) method, exploiting a data-driven low-dimensional linear encoding of the temporal dynamics to further cut the computational costs. The current investigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on the topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier-Stokes equations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a hyper-reduction scheme, based on approximate space-time reduced affine decompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we move beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures, acknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of complex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the Coupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the fluid's equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In particular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio-temporal projection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a by-product. The performances of ST-GRB are assessed in three different numerical experiments. The results confirm that the proposed approach can outperform the classical RB method, yielding precise approximations of high-fidelity solutions at more convenient costs. However, the computational gains of ST-GRB vanish if the number of retained temporal modes is too large, which occurs either when complex dynamics arise or if very precise solutions are sought."

Lasserre's hierarchy (also known as the moment- or sum-of-squares hierarchy) provides a sequence of lower bounds $\{f_{(r)}\}_{r \in \mathbb N}$ on the minimum value $f^*$, where $r$ refers to the allowed degrees in the sum-of-squares hierarchy. A natural question is how fast the hierarchy converges as a function of the parameter $r$. The current state-of-the-art is due to Baldi and Slot [SIAM J. on Applied Algebraic Geometry, 2024] and roughly shows a convergence rate of order $1/r$. Here we obtain closely related results via a different approach: the polynomial kernel method. We also discuss limitations of the polynomial kernel method, suggesting a lower bound of order $1/r^2$ for our approach."

2505.00531,Superintuitionistic predicate logics of linear frames: undecidability with two individual variables,['math.LO'],['Mikhail Rybakov'],"The paper presents a solution to the long-standing question about the decidability of the two-variable fragment of the superintuitionistic predicate logic $\mathbf{QLC}$ defined by the class of linear Kripke frames, which is also the `superintuitionistic' fragment of the modal predicate logic $\mathbf{QS4.3}$, under the Gödel translation. We prove that the fragment is undecidable ($Σ^0_1$-complete). The result remains true for the positive fragment, even with a single binary predicate letter and an infinite set of unary predicate letters. Also, we prove that the logic defined by ordinal $ω$ as a Kripke frame is not recursively enumerable (even both $Σ^0_1$-hard and $Π^0_1$-hard) with the same restrictions on the language. The results remain true if we add also the constant domain condition. The proofs are based on two techniques: a modification of the method proposed by M.Marx and M.Reynolds, which allows us to describe tiling problems using natural numbers rather than pairs of numbers within an enumeration of Cantor's, and an idea of `double labeling' the elements from the domains, which allows us to use only two individual variables in the proof when applying the former method."
2505.00524,Recursive inseparability of classical theories of a binary predicate and non-classical logics of a unary predicate,['math.LO'],['Mikhail Rybakov'],"The paper considers algorithmic properties of classical and non-classical first-order logics and theories in bounded languages. The main idea is to prove the undecidability of various fragments of classical and non-classical first-order logics and theories indirectly, by extracting it as a consequence of the recursive inseparability of special problems associated with them. First, we propose a domino problem, which makes it possible to catch the recursive inseparability of two sets. Second, using this problem, we prove that the classical first-order logic of a binary predicate and the theory of its finite models where the predicate is symmetric and irreflexive are recursively inseparable in a language with a single binary predicate letter and three variables (without constants and equality). Third, we prove, for an infinite class of logics, that the monadic fragment of a modal predicate logic and the logic of the class of its finite Kripke frames are recursively inseparable in languages with a single unary predicate letter and two individual variables; the same result is obtained if we replace the condition of finiteness of frames with the condition of finiteness of domains allowed in frames. Forth, we expand the results to a wide class of superintuitionistic predicate logics. In particular, it is proved that the positive fragments of the intuitionistic predicate logic and the logic of the class of finite intuitionistic Kripke frames are recursively inseparable in the language with a single unary predicate letter and two individual variables. The technique used and the results obtained allow us to answer some additional questions about the decidability of special monadic fragments of some modal and superintuitionistic predicate logics."

The complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n+1}$ shows that this edge bound is sharp.

Very recently, Guenancia and Hamenstädt (GH) proved the existence of the first examples of manifolds that are not locally symmetric but admit a negatively curved Kähler-Einstein metric. The GH metrics are realized on complex hyperbolic branched covers constructed by Stover and Toledo.

2505.00508,Weak Random Feature Method for Solving Partial Differential Equations,['math.NA'],"['Mikhail Kuvakin', 'Zijian Mei', 'Jingrun Chen']","The random feature method (RFM) has demonstrated great potential in bridging traditional numerical methods and machine learning techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It retains the advantages of mesh-free approaches while achieving spectral accuracy for smooth solutions, without the need for iterative procedures. However, the implementation of RFM in the identification of weak solutions remains a subject of limited comprehension, despite crucial role of weak solutions in addressing numerous applied problems. While the direct application of RFM to problems without strong solutions is fraught with potential challenges, we propose an enhancement to the original random feature method that is specifically suited for finding weak solutions and is termed as Weak RFM. Essentially, Weak RFM reformulates the original RFM by adopting the weak form of the governing equations and constructing a new linear system through the use of carefully designed test functions, ensuring that the resulting solution satisfies the weak form by default. To rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark problems, including challenging three-dimensional cases, and compare its performance with state of the art machine learning-based approaches. The results demonstrate that Weak RFM achieves comparable or superior accuracy while significantly reducing computational time and memory consumption, highlighting its potential as a highly efficient and robust tool for finding weak solutions to various PDE problems."

This was known when $G$ is reductive or when $k$ is perfect, and to settle it in general we uncover a wealth of new arithmetic phenomena over imperfect $k$. We build our arguments on new purity theorems for torsors under pseudo-complete, pseudo-proper, and pseudo-finite $k$-groups, for instance, respectively, under wound unipotent $k$-groups, under pseudo-abelian varieties, and under the kernels $\mathrm{Ker}(i_G)$ of comparison maps $i_G$ that relate pseudo-reductive groups to restrictions of scalars of reductive groups. We then deduce an Auslander-Buchsbaum extension theorem for torsors under quasi-reductive $k$-groups; for instance, we show that torsors over $\mathbb{A}^2_k \setminus \{(0,0)\}$ under wound unipotent $k$-groups extend to torsors over $\mathbb{A}^2_k$. For a quasi-reductive $k$-group $G$, this extension theorem allows us to quickly classify $G$-torsors over $\mathbb{P}^1_k$ by an argument that already simplifies the reductive case and to establish Birkhoff, Cartan, and Iwasawa decompositions for $G(k((t)))$. We combine these new results with deep inputs from recent work on the structure of pseudo-reductive and quasi-reductive $k$-groups to show an unramifiedness statement for the Whitehead group (the unstable $K_1$-group) of a quasi-reductive $k$-group, and then use it to argue that, for a smooth $k$-group $G$ and a semilocal $k$-algebra $A$, every $G$-torsor over $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ trivial at $\{t = \infty\}$ is also trivial at $\{t = 0\}$, which is known to imply the Grothendieck--Serre conclusion via geometric arguments. To achieve all this, we develop and heavily use the structure theory of $k$-group schemes locally of finite type."

Using these finite-component covers and the associated functional, we introduce and investigate a variational notion of uniformly star superparacompact subsets in metric spaces in the spirit of studies on uniformly paracompact subset and UC-subset. We show that the collection of all such subsets forms a bornology with a closed base, which is contained in the bornology of uniformly paracompact subsets. Conditions under which these two bornologies coincide are specified. Furthermore, we provide several new characterizations of uniformly star superparacompact metric spaces also known as cofinally Bourbaki-quasi complete spaces in terms of some geometric functionals. As a consequence, we establish new relationships among metric spaces that lie between compactness and completeness."

By $\textbf{e}$ we denote the unique idempotent of the semigroup $\mathcal{S}$. Let $T$ be a sequence over the semigroup $\mathcal{S}$, and let $N(T; \textbf{e})$ be the number of distinct subsequences of $T$ with sum being the idempotent $\textbf{e}$. We obtain the lower bound for $N(T; \textbf{e})$ in terms of the length of $T$, and moreover, prove that $T$ contains subsequences with some smooth-structure in case that $N(T; \textbf{e})$ is not large. Our result generalizes the theorem obtained by W. Gao [Discrete Math., 1994] on the enumeration of zero-sum subsequences over finite cyclic groups to the setting of semigroups."

The proof is based on an exact solution of the inverse spectral problem for Dirac operators with $δ$-interactions on a half-lattice in terms of the Schur's algorithm for analytic functions.

The $N$ intra-group variances and $\frac{1}{2} N (N - 1)$ intra-group covariances where $N = np$ are classified into four categories $T_{1}$, $T_{1\frac{1}{2}}$, $T_{2}$ and $T_{3}$ according to the spectral forms of the precision matrix. The joint distribution of the sample variances and covariances is derived under these four scenarios. Besides, the moment generating function and the joint distribution of latent roots are explicitly calculated. %The distribution of non-central means with known covariance is calculated as an application to the one-sample analysis of variance, with its exact power tabulated up to order two. As an application, we consider a classification problem in the discriminant analysis where the two populations should have different intra-group covariances. The distribution of the ratio of two quadratic forms is considered both in the central and non-central cases, with their exact power tabulated for different $n$ and $p$."

We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach."

As a consequence of these results, we show $(\mathbf{ldep})$ implies $(\mathbf{rdep})$ when $R$ is Gorenstein and that the $(\mathbf{ldep})$ and $(\mathbf{rdep})$ conditions behave well under modding out by regular sequences and completion, but we give a concrete example showing they need not localize. Using our methods, we extend work of Jorgensen by calculating the value $q_R(M,N):=\sup\{i \mid \operatorname{Tor}^R_i(M,N) \ne 0\}$ under certain conditions."
2505.00440,Error bounds for function approximation using generated sets,['math.NA'],"['Ronald Cools', 'Dirk Nuyens', 'Laurence Wilkes']","This paper explores the use of ""generated sets"" $\{ \{ k \boldsymbolζ \} : k = 1, \ldots, n \}$ for function approximation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces which consist of multi-dimensional functions with an absolutely convergent Fourier series. The algorithm is a least squares algorithm that samples the function at the points of a generated set. We show that there exist $\boldsymbolζ \in [0,1]^d$ for which the worst-case $L_2$ error has the optimal order of convergence if the space has polynomially converging approximation numbers. In fact, this holds for a significant portion of the generators. Additionally we show that a restriction to rational generators is possible with a slight increase of the bound. Furthermore, we specialise the results to the weighted Korobov space, where we derive a bound applicable to low values of sample points, and state tractability results."

2505.00434,Stability of the first-order unified gas-kinetic scheme based on a linear kinetic model,['math.NA'],"['Tuowei Chen', 'Kun Xu']","The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is becoming increasingly popular for multiscale simulations in all flow regimes. This paper provides the first analytical study on the stability of the UGKS applied to a linear kinetic model, which is able to reproduce the one-dimensional linear scalar advection-diffusion equation via the Chapman-Enskog expansion method. Adopting periodic boundary conditions and neglecting the error from numerical integration, this paper rigorously proves the weighted $L^2$-stability of the first-order UGKS under the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions. It is shown that the time step of the method is not constrained by being less than the particle collision time, nor is it limited by parabolic type CFL conditions typically applied in solving diffusion equations. The novelty of the proof lies in that based on the ratio of the time step to the particle collision time, the update of distribution functions is viewed as a convex combinations of sub-methods related to various physics processes, such as the particle free transport and collisions. The weighted $L^2$-stability of the sub-methods is obtained by considering them as discretizations to corresponding linear hyperbolic systems and utilizing the associated Riemann invariants. Finally, the strong stability preserving property of the UGKS leads to the desired weighted $L^2$-stability."

In our analysis, $λ$ is regarded as a bifurcation parameter, whereas $h$ is viewed as a deformation parameter between the autonomous case when $a=1$ and the linear case when $a=0$. In this paper, besides establishing some of the multiplicity results suggested by previous numerical experiments (see Cubillos, López-Gómez and Tellini, 2024), we have analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the positive solutions of the problem as $h\uparrow 1$, when the shadow system of the problem is the linear equation $-u''=π^2 u$. This is the first paper where such a problem has been addressed. Numerics is of no help in analyzing this singular perturbation problem because the positive solutions blow-up point-wise in $(0,1)$ as $h\uparrow 1$ if $λ<π^2$."

2505.00420,Uniqueness Domains for ${\bf L}^\infty$ Solutions of $2 \times 2$ Hyperbolic Conservation Laws,['math.AP'],"['Alberto Bressan', 'Elio Marconi', 'Ganesh Vaidya']","For a genuinely nonlinear $2\times 2$ hyperbolic system of conservation laws, assuming that the initial data have small ${\bf L}^\infty$ norm but possibly unbounded total variation, the existence of global solutions was proved in a classical paper by Glimm and Lax (1970). In general, the total variation of these solutions decays like $t^{-1}$. Motivated by the theory of fractional domains for linear analytic semigroups, we consider here solutions with faster decay rate: $\mathrm{Tot. Var. }\bigl\{u(t,\cdot)\bigr\}\leq C t^{α-1}$. For these solutions, a uniqueness theorem is proved. Indeed, as the initial data range over a domain of functions with $\|\bar u\|_{{\bf L}^\infty} \leq\varepsilon_1$ small enough, solutions with fast decay yield a Hölder continuous semigroup. The Hölder exponent can be taken arbitrarily close to $1$ by further shrinking the value of $\varepsilon_1>0$. An auxiliary result identifies a class of initial data whose solutions have rapidly decaying total variation."

Differential Equations, 338:572-590, 2022] proved the existence of periodic steady water waves over an infinitely deep, two-dimensional and constant vorticity flow under the influence of gravity. These solutions include overhanging wave profiles, some of which exhibit surfaces that touch at a point and thereby enclose a bubble of air. We extend these results by formulating a problem that encompasses both infinitely deep and finitely deep flows, and by proving the existence of a continuous curve of water waves that connects a laminar flow to a touching wave for fixed, nonzero gravity. This implies the existence of a wave profile featuring a vertical tangent at a point, which is not overhanging, and is referred to as a breaking wave. We also study the behaviour of critical layers, which are points where the horizontal velocity vanishes, near the surface. In particular, this result holds for arbitrary vorticity."

This problem is a common generalization of \textsc{Max-Weight Independent Set}, \textsc{Odd Cycle Transversal} and \textsc{List $r$-Coloring}, among others. Our result has several consequences.
  First, it implies that, for every fixed $r \geq 5$, assuming $\mathsf{P}\neq \mathsf{NP}$, \textsc{Max-Weight List $r$-Colorable Induced Subgraph} is polynomial-time solvable on $H$-free graphs if and only if $H$ is an induced subgraph of either $kP_3$ or $P_5+kP_1$, for some $k \geq 1$. Second, it makes considerable progress toward a complexity dichotomy for \textsc{Odd Cycle Transversal} on $H$-free graphs, allowing to answer a question of Agrawal, Lima, Lokshtanov, Rz{ą}{ż}ewski, Saurabh, and Sharma [TALG 2024]. Third, it gives a short and self-contained proof of the known result of Chudnovsky, Hajebi, and Spirkl [Combinatorica 2024] that \textsc{List $r$-Coloring} on $kP_3$-free graphs is polynomial-time solvable for every fixed $r$ and $k$.

2505.00411,Affine matrix scrambling achieves smoothness-dependent convergence rates,['math.NA'],['Yang Liu'],"We study the convergence rate of the median estimator for affine matrix scrambled digital nets applied to integrands over the unit hypercube $[0, 1]^s$. By taking the median of $(2r-1)$ independent randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) samples, we demonstrate that the desired convergence rates can be achieved without increasing the number of randomizations $r$ as the quadrature size $N$ grows for both bounded and unbounded integrands. For unbounded integrands, our analysis assumes a boundary growth condition on the weak derivatives and also considers singularities such as kinks and jump discontinuities. Notably, when $r = 1$, the median estimator reduces to the standard RQMC estimator. By applying analytical techniques developed for median estimators, we prove that the affine matrix scrambled estimator achieves a convergence rate depending on the integrand's smoothness, and is therefore not limited by the canonical rate $\mathcal{O}(N^{-3/2})$. However, this smoothness-dependent theoretical rate is not observed empirically in numerical experiments when the affine matrix scrambling yields a heavy-tailed sampling distribution. In contrast, the median estimator consistently reveals the theoretical rates and yields smaller integration errors than mean estimators, further highlighting its advantages."

In this paper, we introduce the notion of quantum immanants in the quantum coordinate algebra using primitive idempotents of the Hecke algebra. By employing $R$-matrix techniques, we establish the quantum analog of Littlewood correspondences between quantum immanants and Schur functions for the quantum coordinate algebra. In the setting of the Schur-Weyl-Jimbo duality, we construct an exact correspondence between the Gelfand-Tsetlin bases of the irreducible representations of the quantum enveloping algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(n))$ and Young's orthonormal basis of an irreducible representation of the Hecke algebra $\mathcal H_m$. This isomorphism leads to our trace formula for the quantum immanants, which settled the generalization problem

Many of convergence analyses of proximal gradient-type methods rely on global descent property between the smooth term and its proximal term. On the other hand, the ability to efficiently solve the subproblem depends on the compatibility between the nonsmooth term and the proximal term. Selecting an appropriate proximal term by considering both factors simultaneously is generally difficult. We overcome this issue by providing convergence analyses for proximal gradient-type methods with general proximal terms, without requiring global descent property of the smooth term. As a byproduct, new convergence results of the interior gradient methods for conic optimization are also provided."

To address this, we propose a novel compact formulation that maintains the ability to represent year-specific characteristics while reducing the dimensionality of the model. The proposed compact formulation is implemented in the open-source model TulipaEnergyModel.jl and offers a tractable alternative for detailed long-term energy system planning."

2505.00370,On the Schrödingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries,"['math.NA', 'quant-ph']","['Shi Jin', 'Nana Liu', 'Chuwen Ma', 'Yue Yu']","The Schrödingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrödinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schrödinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schrödingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schrödingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted."

This result mirrors the known representation of Barron spaces and highlights a fundamental connection between Sobolev regularity and neural network representations.

We first prove that every second-order stationary point of the factorized problem corresponds to an approximate stationary point of its non-factorized counterpart, and those rank-deficient ones correspond to global minimizers of the latter problem when $h$ is additionally convex, conforming with the observations in [2, 15]. Next, discarding the rank condition on the second-order stationary points but assuming the convexity and Lipschitz differentiability of $h$, we characterize, with respect to some natural problem parameters, when every second-order stationary point of the factorized problem is a global minimizer of the corresponding nuclear norm-regularized problem. More precisely, we subdivide the class of Lipschitz differentiable convex $C^2$ functions into subclasses according to those natural parameters and characterize when each subclass consists solely of functions $h$ such that every second-order stationary point of the associated factorized model is a global minimizer of the nuclear norm regularized model. In particular, explicit counterexamples are established when the characterizing condition on the said parameters is violated."

These categories have since been rigorously studied, and shown to contain a certain (combinatorially defined) category on which Webster had previously constructed a (combinatorially defined) braid group action from which the Khovanov homology can be recovered.
  Here we show, by a direct calculation, that the aforementioned containment intertwines said combinatorially defined braid group action with the braid group action arising naturally from monodromy.

Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than state-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on large-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium problems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization. Furthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark dataset CBLIB.

The directed pendant-tree $k$-connectivity extends the concept of pendant-tree $k$-connectivity in undirected graphs studied by Hager [JCTB, 1985] and could be seen as a generalization of classical vertex-connectivity of digraphs.
  In this paper, we completely determine the computational complexity for the parameter $τ_{S,r}(D)$ on Eulerian digraphs and symmetric digraphs. We also give sharp bounds and values for the parameter $τ_{k}(D)$."

We present the broadly applicable MCP algorithm, which uses a matrix of conformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint under the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are each exchangeable. We prove a novel conformal Neyman-Pearson lemma, motivating practical classifier-based choices for our conformal score function. Finally, we exemplify the MCP algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to detect changes in sequences of images, text, and accelerometer data."
2505.00281,Mixed Precision Orthogonalization-Free Projection Methods for Eigenvalue and Singular Value Problems,['math.NA'],"['Tianshi Xu', 'Zechen Zhang', 'Jie Chen', 'Yousef Saad', 'Yuanzhe Xi']","Mixed-precision arithmetic offers significant computational advantages for large-scale matrix computation tasks, yet preserving accuracy and stability in eigenvalue problems and the singular value decomposition (SVD) remains challenging. This paper introduces an approach that eliminates orthogonalization requirements in traditional Rayleigh-Ritz projection methods. The proposed method employs non-orthogonal bases computed at reduced precision, resulting in bases computed without inner-products. A primary focus is on maintaining the linear independence of the basis vectors. Through extensive evaluation with both synthetic test cases and real-world applications, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the desired accuracy while fully taking advantage of mixed-precision arithmetic."

At each time $k$, the walker's step size is $k^{-γ}$ with $γ>0$. We investigate effects of the step size exponent $γ$ and the memory parameter $α\in [-1,1]$ on the long-time behavior of the walker. For fixed $α$, it admits phase transition from divergence to convergence (localization) at $γ_{c}(α)=\max \{α,1/2\}$. This means that large enough memory effect can shift the critical point for localization. Moreover, we obtain quantitative limit theorems which provide a detailed picture of the long-time behavior of the walker."

Suppose that $H$ and $K$ are normal in $B$ and $(H \cap K)\varphi = H \cap K$. Under these assumptions, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for $\mathbb{E}$ to be residually a $\mathcal{C}$-group, where $\mathcal{C}$ is a class of groups closed under taking subgroups, quotient groups, and unrestricted wreath products. Among other things, these conditions give new facts on the residual finiteness and the residual $p$-finiteness of the group $\mathbb{E}$."
2505.00258,Quantile-RK and Double Quantile-RK Error Horizon Analysis,['math.NA'],"['Emeric Battaglia', 'Anna Ma']","In solving linear systems of equations of the form $Ax=b$, corruptions present in $b$ affect stochastic iterative algorithms' ability to reach the true solution $x^\ast$ to the uncorrupted linear system. The randomized Kaczmarz method converges in expectation to $x^\ast$ up to an error horizon dependent on the conditioning of $A$ and the supremum norm of the corruption in $b$. To avoid this error horizon in the sparse corruption setting, previous works have proposed quantile-based adaptations that make iterative methods robust. Our work first establishes a new convergence rate for the quantile-based random Kaczmarz (qRK) and double quantile-based random Kaczmarz (dqRK) methods, which, under certain conditions, improves upon known bounds. We further consider the more practical setting in which the vector $b$ includes both non-sparse ``noise"" and sparse ``corruption"". Error horizon bounds for qRK and dqRK are derived and shown to produce a smaller error horizon compared to their non-quantile-based counterparts, further demonstrating the advantages of quantile-based methods."
2505.00249,Feature preserving data assimilation via feature alignment,"['math.OC', 'physics.flu-dyn']","['Amit N. Subrahmanya', 'Adrian Sandu']","Data assimilation combines information from physical observations and numerical simulation results to obtain better estimates of the state and parameters of a physical system. A wide class of physical systems of interest have solutions that exhibit the formation of structures, called features, which have to be accurately captured by the assimilation framework. For example, fluids can develop features such as shockwaves and contact discontinuities that need to be tracked and preserved during data assimilation. State-of-the-art data assimilation techniques are agnostic of such features. Current ensemble-based methods construct state estimates by taking linear combinations of multiple ensemble states; repeated averaging tends to smear the features over multiple assimilation cycles, leading to nonphysical state estimates. A novel feature-preserving data assimilation methodology that combines sequence alignment with the ensemble transform particle filter is proposed to overcome this limitation of existing assimilation algorithms. Specifically, optimal transport of particles is performed along feature-aligned characteristics. The strength of the proposed feature-preserving filtering approach is demonstrated on multiple test problems described by the compressible Euler equations."

We consider the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_β(X, D, \mathfrak{d})$ of sheaves on $X$ which are direct images of rank-$1$ torsion-free sheaves on integral curves $C$ in $β$ such that $C|_D=\mathfrak{d}$, and show that each point of $\mathcal{M}_β(X, D, \mathfrak{d})$ is smooth over a point in the product of the Hilbert schemes of surface singularities of types $A_{w_i-1}$.

We prove that the confined dynamics converges pathwise and on bounded time intervals to the solution of a projected SDE in the limit of infinitely strong confinement, where the projection is explicitly given and depends on the choice of the confinement force. We present results for linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes, but they straightforwardly generalise to nonlinear SDEs. Moreover, for linear OU processes that admit a unique invariant measure, we discuss conditions under which the limit also preserves the long-term properties of the SDE. More precisely, we discuss choices for the design of the confinement force which in the limit yield a projected dynamics with invariant measure that agrees with the conditional invariant measure of the unconstrained processes for the given constraint. The theoretical findings are illustrated with suitable numerical examples."

We assume the function satisfies smoothness and strong convexity. These assumptions together with the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property, allow us to derive global asymptotic convergence for the sequence generated by the algorithm. Furthermore, we also derive a convergence rate that depends on the geometric properties of the problem. To illustrate the implications of the convergence result obtained, we prove a new convergence result for a sparse principal component analysis algorithm, propose a convergent reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization algorithm for compressed sensing, and design a new algorithm for the semidefinite relaxation of the Max-Cut problem."

In such a causal model each entry $X_i$ of the random vector $X$ corresponds to a vertex $i$ of a directed acyclic graph $G$ and can be expressed as a linear combination of its direct causes $\{X_j: j\to i\}$ and random noise. For any directed acyclic graph $G$, we show that a random vector $X$ arises from a LiNGAM with graph $G$ if and only if certain easy-to-construct matrices, whose entries are second- and third-order moments of $X$, drop rank. This determinantal characterization extends previous results proven for polytrees and generalizes the well-known local Markov property for Gaussian models."

2505.00198,Queueing models with random resetting,['math.PR'],"['Guodong Pang', 'Izabella Stuhl', 'Yuri Suhov']","We introduce and study some queueing models with random resetting, including Markovian and non--Markovian models. The Markovian models include M/M/1, M/M/r and M/M/$\infty$ queues with random resetting, in which a continuous-time Markov chain is formulated and the transition from each state includes a resetting to state zero in addition to the arrival and service transitions. Hence the chains are no longer a birth and death process as in the classical models. We explicitly characterize the stationary distributions of the queueing processes in these models. It is worth noting the distinction of the stability conditions from the standard models, that is, the positive recurrence of the Markov chains does not require the usual traffic intensity to be less than one.
  The non--Markovian models include GI/GI/1, GI/GI/$r$ and GI/GI/$\infty$ queues with random resetting to state zero. For GI/GI/1 and GI/GI/$r$ queues, we consider random resetting at arrival times, and introduce modified Lindley recursions and Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursions, respectively. Using an operator representation for these recursions, we characterize the stationary distributions via convergent series, as solutions to the modified Wiener--Hopf equations. For GI/GI/1 queues with random resetting, a particularly interesting case is when the difference of the service and interarrival times is positive, for which an explicit characterization of the stationary distribution of the delay/waiting time is provided via the associated characteristic functions. For GI/GI/$\infty$ queues, we also consider random resettings at arrival times, by utilizing a version of the Kiefer--Wolfowitz recursion motivated from that for GI/GI/$r$ queues, and also characterize the corresponding stationary distribution."

Central to our approach is a new Fourier--Mukai duality for formal groups. We prove that when $\widehat{E}$ is the formal group associated to an elliptic curve $E$, the resulting $\widehat{E}$-Hochschild homology coincides with the mapping stack construction of Sibilla--Tomasini. This identification also recovers ordinary and Hodge Hochschild homology as degenerate limits corresponding to nodal and cuspidal cubics, respectively. Building on this, we introduce global versions of elliptic Hochschild homology over the moduli stacks of elliptic and cubic curves, which interpolate between these theories and suggest a universal form of TMF-Hochschild homology."
2505.00167,Uniqueness of asymptotically conical Kähler-Ricci flow,['math.DG'],['Longteng Chen'],"We study the uniqueness problem for the Kähler-Ricci flow with a conical initial condition. Given a complete gradient expanding Kähler-Ricci soliton on a non compact manifold with quadratic curvature decay, including its derivatives, we establish that any complete solution to the Kahler-Ricci flow emerging from the soliton's tangent cone at infinity--appearing as a Kähler cone--must coincide with the forward self-similar Kähler-Ricci flow associated with the soliton, provided certain conditions hold. Specifically, if its Kähler form remains in the same cohomology class as that of the soliton's self-similar Kähler-Ricci flow, its full Riemann curvature operator is bounded for each fixed positive time, its Ricci curvature is bounded from above by A/t, its scalar curvature is bounded from below by -A/t, and it shares a same Killing vector field with the soliton metric.

Tanglegrams are used to model co-evolution in various settings. A tanglegram layout is a straight line drawing where the two trees are drawn as plane trees with their leaf-sets on two parallel lines, and only the edges of the matching may cross. The tangle crossing number of a tanglegram is the minimum crossing number among its layouts. It is known that tanglegrams have crossing number at least one precisely when they contain one of two size 4 subtanglegrams, which we refer to as cross-inducing subtanglegrams. We show here that a tanglegram with exactly one cross inducing subtanglegram must have tangle crossing number exactly one, and ask the question whether the tangle-crossing number of tanglegrams with exactly k cross-inducing subtanglegrams is bounded for every k."

Let $α> 0$. Let $Φ(u) = u^2 \log^α(u)$ for $u \geq u_{0}$, and $Φ(u) = c(α) u^2$ otherwise. $u_0 \geq e$ and $c(α)$ are constants chosen so that $Φ$ is a Young function, depending only on $α$. Our main result shows that with probability at least $1/4$ over subsets $I$ of $[n]$, where $I$ is constructed by choosing each index of $[n]$ independently from a Bernoulli distribution, the following holds: $|I| \geq \frac{n}{e \log^{α+1}(n)} $ and for any $a \in \mathbb{C}^n$, $$ \left \|\sum_{i \in I} a_i \varphi_i \right \|_Φ \leq K(α) \log^{\fracα{2}}(\log n) \cdot \|a\|_2. $$ $K(α)$ is a constant depending only on $α$.
  In the main Theorem of \cite{Ryou22}, Ryou proved the result above to a constant factor, depending on $p$ and $α$, when the Orlicz space is a $L^p(\log L)^{pα}$ space for $p > 2$ where $|I| \sim \frac{n^{2/p}}{\log^{2 α/p}(n)}$. However, their work did not extend to the case where $p=2$, an open question in \cite{Iosevich25}. Our result resolves the latter question up to $\log \log n$ factors. Moreover, our result sharpens the constants of Limonova's main result in \cite{Limonova23} from a factor of $\log n$ to a factor of $\log \log n$, if the orthogonal functions are bounded by a constant. In addition, our proof is much shorter and simpler than the latter's.
  Finally, to complement our main result, we give a probabilistic lower bound (subsets of $[n]$ are selected by a Bernoulli distribution over $[n]$'s indices) that matches our main result's upper bound."

The inherent ill-posedness of such problems is addressed by introducing suitable measure-valued priors that encode prior information and promote desired sparsity properties of the parameter. Under appropriate assumptions on the forward operator and noise model, we establish the well-posedness of the Bayesian formulation by proving the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the posterior with respect to perturbations in the observed data. In addition, we also discuss computational strategies for approximating the posterior distribution. Finally, we present some examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

For nondecreasing domains that merely satisfy $\mathcal{L}^{n+1}(\partial E) = 0$, we prove the existence of variational solutions $u \in C^{0}([0,T];L^{q+1}(E,\mathbb{R}^N))$ via a nonlinear version of the method of minimizing movements. Moreover, under additional assumptions on $E$ and a $p$-growth condition on $f$, we show that $|u|^{q-1}u$ admits a weak time derivative in the dual $(V^{p,0}(E))^{\prime}$ of the subspace $V^{p,0}(E) \subset L^p(0,T;W^{1,p}(Ω,\mathbb{R}^N))$ that encodes zero boundary values."

For finite element spaces of differential forms on simplicial meshes, Arnold, Falk, and Winther showed that geometric decompositions can be constructed from extension operators satisfying certain properties. In this paper, we generalize their results to function spaces and meshes satisfying very minimal hypotheses, while at the same time reducing the conditions that must hold for the extension operators. In particular, the geometry of the mesh and the mesh elements can be completely arbitrary, and the function spaces need only have well-defined restrictions to subelements. In this general context, we show that extension operators yield geometric decompositions for both the primal and dual function spaces. Later, we specialize to simplicial meshes, and we show that, to obtain geometric decompositions, one needs only to construct extension operators on the reference simplex in each dimension. In particular, for simplicial meshes, the existence of geometric decompositions depends only on the dimension of the mesh."

This is done in a systematic way by using the abstract concept of boundary triplets and their Weyl functions from extension and spectral theory of symmetric and self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces. Our treatment follows closely the well-known one for classical Laplacians on intervals and it shows that all self-adjoint realizations have purely discrete spectrum and are semibounded from below. To demonstrate the method, we focus on three self-adjoint realizations of the restricted fractional Laplacian: the Friedrichs extension, corresponding to Dirichlet-type boundary conditions, the Krein--von Neumann extension, and a Neumann-type realization. Notably, the Neumann-type realization exhibits a simple negative eigenvalue, thus it is not larger than the Krein--von Neumann extension."

The perturbation terms are assumed to have finite Fourier series in time, and the perturbed systems are rewritten as higher-dimensional autonomous systems having the small parameter as a state variable. We show that if the Melnikov functions are not constant, then the autonomous systems are not \emph{real-meromorphically} integrable near homo- and heteroclinic orbits. We illustrate the theory for rotational motions of a periodically forced rigid body, which provides a mathematical model of a quadrotor helicopter."
2505.00072,On BD-algebra and CM-Auslander algebra for a gentle algebra and their representation types,"['math.RT', 'math.RA']","['Mengdie Zhang', 'Yu-Zhe Liu', 'Chao Zhang']","Let $A$ be a gentle algebra, and $B$ and $C$ be its BD-gentle algebra and CM-Auslander algebra, respectively. In this paper, we show that the representation-finiteness of $A$, $B$ and $C$ coincide and the representation-discreteness of $A$, $B$ and $C$ coincide."
2505.00052,Bernstein widths of nonisotropic Nikolskii-Besov classes,"['math.CA', 'math.FA']",['S. N. Kudryavtsev'],"The article examines nonisotropic Nikolskii and Besov spaces with norms defined using $L_p$-averaged moduli of continuity of functions of appropriate orders along the coordinate directions, instead of moduli of continuity of known orders for derivative functions along the same directions. For the unit balls of such spaces of functions defined in domains of certain type, weak asymptotics of Bernstein $n$-widths behavior in $L_q$-spaces has been obtained."
2505.00048,Orbitwise expansive maps,"['math.DS', 'math.GN']","['Debasish Bhattacharjee', 'Humayan Kobir', 'Santanu Acharjee']","This study defines an orbitwise expansive point (OE) as a point, such as $x$ in a metric space $(X,ρ)$, if there is a number $d>0$ such that the orbits of a few points inside an arbitrary open sphere will maintain a distance greater than $d$ from the corresponding points of the orbit of $x$ at least once. The point $x$ is referred to as the relatively orbitwise expansive point (ROE) in the previously described scenario if $d$ is replaced with the radius of the open sphere whose orbit is investigated and whose centre is $x$. %The function generating the orbit is considered to be continuous.
  We also define OE (ROE) set. We prove that arbitrary union of OE (ROE) set is again OE (ROE) set and every limit point of an OE set is an OE point. We show that, rather than the other way around, Utz's expansive map or Kato's CW-expansive map implies OE (ROE) map. We utilise the concept of OE(ROE) to analyse a time-varying dynamical system and investigate its relevance to certain traits associated with expansiveness."
