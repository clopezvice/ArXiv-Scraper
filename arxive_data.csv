2504.21514,Poncelet porism in singular cases,"['math.AG', 'nlin.SI']","['Vladimir Dragovic', 'Milena Radnovic']","The celebrated Poncelet porism is usually studied for a pair of smooth conics that are in a general position. Here we discuss Poncelet porism in the real plane - affine or projective, when that is not the case, i.e. the conics have at least one point of tangency or at least one of the conics is not smooth. In all such cases, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an n-gon inscribed in one of the conics and circumscribed about the other."

Using an asymptotic Kodama-Fokas-Liu near-identity transformation, we map the eKdV equation to the Gardner equation. This improved Gardner equation has a different cubic nonlinearity coefficient and an additional transport term compared to the frequently used truncated Gardner equation. We then construct approximate solitary and cnoidal wave solutions of the eKdV equation using this mapping and test validity and performance of these approximations, as well as performance of the truncated and improved Gardner and eKdV equations, by comparison with direct numerical simulations of the strongly-nonlinear two-layer long-wave parent system in the absence of currents."

First, we derive the lump solutions using a positive quadratic polynomial within the Hirota perturbation technique. Next, We study the explicit interactions between lumps and one or two-kink waves, and observe double lump patterns. Furthermore, we discover the interactions of breathers, revealing a diffusion-like behavior. We notice that breather waves can interact with periodic, kink, and bright solitons for specific parameter sets in the CB system. Interactions between two chains of double breathers are also found. We analyze our results using a combination of symbolic computations and graphical representations, providing a deeper understanding of their behavior. This study reveals previously unreported nonlinear dynamics in the CB system."

Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied by Sasada and Uozumi (2024). Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions."
2504.21352,How one can assess the chaos?,['nlin.CD'],['Marat Akhmet'],"We propose an uncertainty principle for chaos, focusing on two key characteristics: alpha unpredictability and Lorenz sensitivity. This principle outlines a limitation on the relationship between two infinite sequences that underpin these concepts. It is applicable to both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, marking a significant step toward integrating these two fields. Our initial progress in this area was achieved through research on Markov chains utilizing alpha labeling.
  Additionally, we offer suggestions on how this principle can assess the degree of chaos in specific processes. We also outline open questions regarding the relationships among various types of chaos, including a modification of the recurrence theorem."
2504.21315,Long-time asymptotics of the coupled nonlinear Schödinger equation in a weighted Sobolev space,['nlin.SI'],"['Yubin Huang', 'Liming Ling', 'Xiaoen Zhang']","We study the Cauchy problem for the focusing coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (CNLS) equation with initial data $\mathbf{q}_0$ lying in the weighted Sobolev space and the scattering data having $n$ simple zeros. Based on the corresponding $3\times3$ matrix spectral problem, we deduce the Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) for CNLS equation through inverse scattering transform. We remove discrete spectrum of initial RHP using Darboux transformations. By applying the nonlinear steepest-descent method for RHP introduced by Deift and Zhou, we compute the long-time asymptotic expansion of the solution $\mathbf{q}(x,t)$ to an (optimal) residual error of order $\mathcal{O}\left(t^{-3 / 4+1/(2p)}\right)$ where $2\le p<\infty$. The leading order term in this expansion is a multi-soliton whose parameters are modulated by soliton-soliton and soliton-radiation interactions. Our work strengthens and extends the earlier work regarding long-time asymptotics for solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a delta potential and even initial data by Deift and Park."

Johnson', 'Frank Yingjie Huo']","Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts -- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to 'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics, it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''"
2504.20858,Chaos Meets Attention: Transformers for Large-Scale Dynamical Prediction,['nlin.CD'],"['Yi He', 'Yiming Yang', 'Xiaoyuan Cheng', 'Hai Wang', 'Xiao Xue', 'Boli Chen', 'Yukun Hu']","Generating long-term trajectories of dissipative chaotic systems autoregressively is a highly challenging task. The inherent positive Lyapunov exponents amplify prediction errors over time. Many chaotic systems possess a crucial property - ergodicity on their attractors, which makes long-term prediction possible. State-of-the-art methods address ergodicity by preserving statistical properties using optimal transport techniques. However, these methods face scalability challenges due to the curse of dimensionality when matching distributions. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a scalable transformer-based framework capable of stably generating long-term high-dimensional and high-resolution chaotic dynamics while preserving ergodicity. Our method is grounded in a physical perspective, revisiting the Von Neumann mean ergodic theorem to ensure the preservation of long-term statistics in the $\mathcal{L}^2$ space. We introduce novel modifications to the attention mechanism, making the transformer architecture well-suited for learning large-scale chaotic systems. Compared to operator-based and transformer-based methods, our model achieves better performances across five metrics, from short-term prediction accuracy to long-term statistics. In addition to our methodological contributions, we introduce a new chaotic system benchmark: a machine learning dataset of 140$k$ snapshots of turbulent channel flow along with various evaluation metrics for both short- and long-term performances, which is well-suited for machine learning research on chaotic systems."
2504.20689,"DICOM Compatible, 3D Multimodality Image Encryption using Hyperchaotic Signal","['cs.CR', 'nlin.CD']","['Anandik N Anand', 'Sishu Shankar Muni', 'Abhishek Kaushik']","Medical image encryption plays an important role in protecting sensitive health information from cyberattacks and unauthorized access. In this paper, we introduce a secure and robust encryption scheme that is multi-modality compatible and works with MRI, CT, X-Ray and Ultrasound images for different anatomical region of interest. The method utilizes hyperchaotic signals and multi-level diffusion methods. The encryption starts by taking DICOM image as input, then padding to increase the image area. Chaotic signals are produced by a logistic map and are used to carry out pixel random permutation. Then, multi-level diffusion is carried out by 4-bit, 8-bit, radial and adjacent diffusion to provide high randomness and immunity against statistical attacks. In addition, we propose a captcha-based authentication scheme to further improve security. An algorithm generates alphanumeric captcha-based image which is encrypted with the same chaotic and diffusion methods as the medical image. Both encrypted images(DICOM image and captcha image) are then superimposed to create a final encrypted output, essentially integrating dual-layer security. Upon decryption, the superimposed image is again decomposed back to original medical and captcha images, and inverse operations are performed to obtain the original unencrypted data. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides strong protection with no loss in image integrity, thereby reducing unauthorized data breaches to a significant level. The dual-encryption approach not only protects the confidentiality of the medical images but also enhances authentication by incorporating captcha."
2504.20515,Integrability of homogeneous exact magnetic flows on spheres,"['math.DG', 'nlin.SI']","['Vladimir Dragovic', 'Borislav Gajic', 'Bozidar Jovanovic']","We consider motion of a material point placed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field in $\mathbb R^n$ and also motion restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. While there is an obvious integrability of the magnetic system in $\mathbb R^n$, the integrability of the system restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$ is highly non-trivial. We prove complete integrability of the obtained restricted magnetic systems for $n\le 6$. The first integrals of motion of the magnetic flows on the spheres $S^{n-1}$, for $n=5$ and $n=6$, are polynomials of the degree $1$, $2$, and $3$ in momenta. We prove noncommutative integrability of the obtained magnetic flows for any $n\ge 7$ when the systems allow a reduction to the cases with $n\le 6$. We conjecture that the restricted magnetic systems on $S^{n-1}$ are integrable for all $n$."
2504.20418,An energy landscape-based theoretical framework for understanding the emergence of functions in a living system under the dynamical component interaction,"['physics.bio-ph', 'nlin.AO', 'doi', '10.1016/j.biosystems.2025.105631']","['Ryunosuke Suzuki', 'Taiji Adachi']","In a living system composed of interacting components such as molecules, cells, and tissues, each component often adaptively changes its internal states in response to interactions with its surrounding components. For example, individual tissues exhibit component-level adaptive behavior, such as growth and remodeling, in response to their mechanical interactions, resulting in the emergence of functions of a multi-tissue system. Along with the adaptive behavior of the components, their interactions exhibit dynamical changes, which strongly influence the emergence of system functions. To understand how the emergence of system functions occurs from such dynamical interactions due to component-level adaptive behavior, this study proposes a theoretical framework that formulates the dynamics of interactions among components due to the adaptive behavior of individual components. For modeling the adaptive internal state changes, we assign an energy landscape and its associated energy rate landscape for each component, leading to the generalized gradient flow model of adaptive behavior. Then, we represent interaction dynamics based on temporal changes in these energy and energy rate landscapes by formulating temporal changes in the environmental states of each component due to the adaptive behavior of individual components. Through case studies using simplified models of mechanically interacting tissues under morphological changes, our theoretical framework demonstrates that temporal changes in applied forces due to morphological changes of individual tissues determine the emergence of system functions. These findings highlight that expressing interaction dynamics based on temporal changes in energy and energy rate landscapes offers a powerful theoretical framework for understanding how system functions emerge from component-level adaptive behavior."
2504.20292,Integrable black hole dynamics in the asymptotic structure of AdS$_{3}$,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc', 'math-ph', 'nlin.PS', 'nlin.SI']","['Marcela Cárdenas', 'Francisco Correa', 'Miguel Pino']","This work deepens the study of integrable asymptotic symmetries for AdS$_{3}$. They are given by an infinite set of integrable nonlinear equations known as the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, characterized by an also infinite set of abelian conserved charges. We present their field-dependent Killing vectors and the computation of the canonical charges associated to the asymptotic metric, together with their corresponding charge algebra. We study black hole thermodynamics and show that the temperature for stationary black holes falling in the AKNS asymptotics is always constant, even in the case where the solutions are not axisymmetric. This is related to the existence of a hyperelliptic curve, which appears as a fundamental object in many integrable systems. We also present a special solution associated with the Korteweg-de Vries equation, that is a particular case of the AKNS integrable hierarchy. It is presented in the form of a periodic soliton leading to a cnoidal KdV black hole, whose temperature is characterized by two copies of hyperelliptic curves."

Soft billiards are a generalization that includes a smooth boundary whose dynamics are governed by Hamiltonian equations and overcome overly simplistic representations. We study the dynamical features of an anisotropic soft-wall squircle billiard. This curve is a geometric figure that seamlessly blends the angularity of a square with the smooth curves of a circle. We characterize the billiard's emerging trajectories, exhibiting the onset of chaos and its alternation with regularity in the parameter space. We characterize the transition to chaos and the stabilization of the dynamics by revealing the nonlinearity of the parameters (squarness, ellipticity, and hardness) via the computation of Poincaré surfaces of section and the Lyapunov exponent across the parameter space. We expect our work to introduce a valuable tool to increase understanding of the onset of chaos in soft billiards."

The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits. Our picture is supported by numerical simulations for the model of the Josephson junction and Mathieu equation."
2504.20162,Anti-localization of non-stationary quasi-waves in a strongly nonlinear $β$-FPUT chain,"['nlin.PS', 'physics.class-ph']","['Serge N. Gavrilov', 'Ekaterina V. Shishkina', 'Bogdan S.

Vib. 553, 2023, 117673). This is zeroing of the propagating component for a non-stationary wave-field near a defect in infinitely long wave-guides. The phenomenon is known to be observed in both continuum and discrete mechanical systems with a defect, provided that the frequency spectrum for the corresponding homogeneous system possesses a stop-band. In this paper, we show that the anti-localization is also quite common for nonlinear systems. To demonstrate this, we numerically solve several non-stationary problems for an infinite strongly nonlinear $β$-FPUT chain with a defect. In our opinion, the anti-localization essentially influences the processes of heat transfer in linear and nonlinear lattices."

Despite severe associated climate impacts, assessing the AMOC's response under global warming and its proximity to possible critical thresholds remains difficult. To understand future Earth system stability, a global dynamical view is needed beyond the local stability analysis underlying classical early-warning methods. Using an intermediate-complexity climate model, we explore the stability landscape of the AMOC for different atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations. We explicitly compute the edge state (or Melancholia state), a chaotic saddle on the basin boundary separating the strong and weak AMOC attractors found in the model. While being unstable, the edge state can govern the transient climate for centuries, supporting centennial AMOC oscillations driven by atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions in the North Atlantic. At increased CO$_2$ levels projected for the near future, we reveal a boundary crisis where the current AMOC attractor disappears by colliding with the edge state. Under crisis overshoot, long chaotic transients due to ""ghost states"" lead to diverging ensemble trajectories under time-varying forcing. Rooted in dynamical systems theory, our results offer an explanation of large ensemble variance and apparent ""stochastic bifurcations"" observed in earth system models under intermediate forcing scenarios."

In contrast to the well-studied one-dimensional dissipative Swift-Hohenberg equation, the complex variant introduces a wide array of largely unexplored solutions. Our study provides a fundamental step in understanding the complex characteristics of this equation, particularly for typical classes of solutions-uniform, periodic, and localized states-and their relationship with the original dissipative model. Our findings reveal significant differences between the two models. For instance, uniform solutions in the conservative model are inherently unstable, and periodic solutions are generally unstable except within a narrow parameter interval that supports multiple localized states. Furthermore, we establish a generalized Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion to determine the stability of localized states in the conservative equation and relate it to the stability properties of the dissipative counterpart."
2504.19921,The impact of strong activity disruption on building energetics,"['physics.soc-ph', 'nlin.AO', 'stat.AP']","['Yu-Hsuan Hsu', 'Sara Beery', 'Christopher P. Kempes', 'Mingzhen Lu', 'Serguei Saavedra']","Evidence shows that biological organisms tend to be more energetically efficient per unit size. These scaling patterns observed in biological organisms have also been observed in the energetic requirements of cities. However, at lower levels of organization where energetic interventions can be more manageable, such as buildings, this analysis has remained more elusive due to the difficulties in collecting fine-grained data. Here, we use the maintenance energy usage in buildings at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 2009 to 2024 to analyze energetic trends at the scale of individual buildings and their sensitivity to strong external perturbations. We find that, similar to the baseline metabolism of biological organisms, large buildings are on average $24\%$ more energetically efficient per unit size than smaller buildings. Because it has become debatable how to better measure the efficiency of buildings, this scaling pattern naturally establishes a baseline efficiency for buildings, where deviations from the mean would imply a more or less efficient building than the baseline according to volume. This relative efficiency progressively increased to $34\%$ until 2020. However, the strong activity disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a major shock, removing this trend and leading to a reversal to the expected $24\%$ baseline level. This suggests that energetic adaptations are contingent on relatively stable conditions."

Recent studies have suggested that supratransmission in a damped-driven Klein-Gordon equation can lead to the formation of rogue waves. In this work, we reduce the same model to a damped and driven discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation and demonstrate that the claimed rogue waves are unstable solitons exhibiting breathing dynamics. Through extensive numerical simulations, we thoroughly investigate and analyze the behavior of solitons and supratransmission in these lattices. Additionally, we perform asymptotic analysis to explain the underlying mechanism responsible for supratransmission.

Whether such a transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic dynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling mechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through mechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon compression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of Brusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator Ring (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of patterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent fluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders three dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four phases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and phases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems."

Utilizing the reductive perturbation method and a specific transformation, we analyze the influence of different time-dependent linear potentials on these nonlinear wave structures. The analysis is conducted for three representative cases: (i) a constant potential, which modifies the orientation and amplitude of breathers and positons, (ii) a periodically modulated potential, which transforms them into crescent-shaped structures with unique spatial characteristics, and (iii) an exponentially varying potential, which induces asymmetric crescent-shaped waveforms. Additionally, we show that linear potentials significantly influence breather and positon dynamics in the modified electrical transmission line by altering their position and positon amplitude-constant potentials maintain peaks at the origin, periodic potentials shift breathers forward and positons backward, while exponential potentials move breathers backward and positons forward. Our findings highlight the critical role of external modulation in shaping wave propagation, localizing waves, and altering their amplitude, demonstrating its potential for controlling wave dynamics in nonlinear transmission lines. Unlike previous studies that focused on rogue waves, this work provides new insights into the evolution of breathers and positons under external perturbations. The results may have significant implications for applications in electrical transmission networks."

Ray', 'James P. Crutchfield']","Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics."

Specifically for complex systems with tunable parameters, these conditions for robust splitting (RS) are abundant, and by using multiple tunable parameters the relative amplitude and phase of the output signals can also be tuned. The splitting property of the systems works for all possible input phase differences and amplitude ratios and does not require a particular coherent input signal. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at RS conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$π$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the RS conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems and involves some degree of attenuation, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) and hold in generic complex scattering systems."

In this work, we extend this study to explore the transmission of positon solutions or positons in the modified Noguchi electrical transmission line model. By converting the circuit equations into the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, we identify positons, a special type of solution with algebraic decay and oscillatory patterns. Unlike solitons, which are used for stable energy transmission, positons provide persistent energy localization and controlled spreading over long distances. We consider second-order and third-order positon solutions and examine their transmission behaviour in electrical lines. We show that over long times, the amplitude and width of both second- and third-order positons remain largely unaffected, indicating stable transmission. We also analyze what are the parameters affect the amplitude and localization of this kind of waves. Our investigations reveal that the amplitude and localization of positons are significantly influenced by the parameter $ε$ that appear in the solution. Our findings have practical implications for improving energy transmission in electrical systems, where the management of wave localization and dispersion is crucial."

Resta', 'Y. Moreno', 'J. M. Buldu']","In this study, we investigate the interplay between player speed and ball control in soccer. We present a novel pitch control algorithm that quantifies the probability of a player gaining possession at any location on the field. Our model accounts for the heterogeneity of player speeds by measuring performance during matches and assigning each player a specific top speed. We then compare the pitch control percentages derived from our approach with those from classical models, which assume uniform top speeds for all players, and analyze the results across different player roles (defenders, midfielders, and forwards). Our findings reveal a positive correlation between a player's top speed and their accumulated pitch control, with certain players benefiting more from this relationship. However, this positive correlation is constrained by the role of the player in the team, with defenders achieving the highest accumulated pitch control despite not being the fastest. Furthermore, our methodology supports team-level analysis, identifying which teams gain the greatest advantage from their players' top speeds, and extends to comparisons between the first and second halves of matches. Our model also enables exploration of how changes in top speed may affect pitch control at both the individual and team levels. To facilitate this, we introduce the stamina factor, a parameter that adjusts a player's top speed. We find that the impact of the stamina factor on pitch control follows a logarithmic function, with the scaling factor quantifying the potential benefits of increased speed. Interestingly, the influence of the stamina factor varies significantly by player position. Overall, our approach provides valuable insights into which teams or players could benefit most from improvements in physical performance."

We also explore the intricate dynamics of wave propagation in nonlinear electrical line. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of network parameters, such as inductances, capacitances, and nonlinear coefficients, in shaping wave behavior, offering not only practical guidelines for the design, stability, and experimental investigation of electrical transmission systems but also provides practical approaches for controlling and managing breather and super rogue wave phenomena in the transmission lines."

The Yang-Baxter equation contains an infinite number of seemingly independent constraints on the operator valued coefficients in the expansion of the $R$-matrices with respect to their spectral parameters, with the lowest order one being the Reshetikhin condition. These coefficients can be solved iteratively using Kennedy's inversion formula, which reconstructs the $R$-matrix after an infinite number of steps. For a generic Hamiltonian, the procedure could fail at any step, making the conditions useful as an integrability test.

This model is derived from a unified framework that accounts for Brillouin scattering and four-wave mixing. It involves two coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations for the forward and backward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic oscillation. Under the standard assumptions for the mean-field approach (high finesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion) we demonstrate that our model closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant mathematical structure of our equation provides valuable physical insights. As a key example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic perturbations to the steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and accurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods. We highlight the effectiveness of this approach by simulating frequency comb generation in state-of-the-art high-Q fiber Fabry-Perot resonators."

This work formulates the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the SK and mSK equations by using direct and inverse scattering transforms. The long-time asymptotic behaviors of the solutions to these equations are then analyzed via the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for Riemann-Hilbert problems. It is shown that the asymptotic solutions of the SK and mSK equations are categorized into four distinct regions: the decay region, the dispersive wave region, the Painlevé region, and the rapid decay region. Notably, the Painlevé region is governed by the F-XVIII equation in the Painlevé classification of fourth-order ordinary differential equations, a fourth-order analogue of the Painlevé transcendents. This connection is established through the Riemann-Hilbert formulation in this work. Similar to the KdV equation, the SK equation exhibits a transition region between the dispersive wave and Painlevé regions, arising from the special values of the reflection coefficients at the origin. Finally, numerical comparisons demonstrate that the asymptotic solutions agree excellently with results from direct numerical simulations."
2504.17503,Tailored minimal reservoir computing: on the bidirectional connection between nonlinearities in the reservoir and in data,"['cs.LG', 'nlin.CD']","['Davide Prosperino', 'Haochun Ma', 'Christoph Räth']","We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to model."

Whole-brain modelling allows us to explore candidate mechanisms causing the observed patterns. However, it is not fully established how the choice of model type and the networks' resolution influence the simulation results, hence, it remains unclear, to which extent conclusions drawn from these results are limited by modelling artefacts. Here, we compare the dynamics of a biophysically realistic, linear-nonlinear cascade model of whole-brain activity with a phenomenological Wilson-Cowan model using three structural connectomes based on the Schaefer parcellation scheme with 100, 200, and 500 nodes. Both neural mass models implement the same mechanistic hypotheses, which specifically address the interaction between excitation, inhibition, and a slow adaptation current, which affects the excitatory populations. We quantify the emerging dynamical states in detail and investigate how consistent results are across the different model variants. Then we apply both model types to the specific phenomenon of slow oscillations, which are a prevalent brain rhythm during deep sleep. We investigate the consistency of model predictions when exploring specific mechanistic hypotheses about the effects of both short- and long-range connections and of the antero-posterior structural connectivity gradient on key properties of these oscillations. Overall, our results demonstrate that the coarse-grained dynamics are robust to changes in both model type and network resolution. In some cases, however, model predictions do not generalize. Thus, some care must be taken when interpreting model results."

The main purpose of our work is to further generalize and improve Geng's work. Compared with the previous work, our asymptotic error accuracy has been improved from $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log t}t)$ to $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. More importantly, by establishing two matrix valued functions, we obtained effective asymptotic errors and successfully constructed asymptotic analysis of the spin-1 GP equation based on the characteristics of the spectral problem, including two cases: (i)coexistence of discrete and continuous spectrum; (ii)only continuous spectrum which considered by Geng's work with error $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log t}t)$. For the case (i), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with an $N$-soliton as well as an interaction term between soliton solutions and the dispersion term with diverse residual error order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. For the case (ii), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with the leading term on the continuous spectrum and the residual error order $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. Finally, our results confirm the soliton resolution conjecture for the spin-1 GP equation."

This effect is present in the experimental recordings of single-channel currents, but not only. The sequences of dwell times of functionally different channel states also exhibit long-range correlations. We have found that the memory effect within the dwell-time series is related to the coupling between the channel's activation gate (AG) and selectivity filter (SF), which controls the ion conduction. In this work, we analyzed both the experimental data describing the activity of potassium channels of different types (e.g., BK, mitoBK, mitoTASK-3, mitoKv1.3, TREK-2-like channels) and the series generated according to our previously proposed Hurst effect model. The obtained results suggest that the strength of the allosteric cooperation between the AG and SF determines not only the conductance of the channel - which governs how often ions in SF move or remain blocked - but also modulates the correlations present in the dwell times when sampled with a suitably high sampling rate. Moreover, we found that rectification can interfere with this process, contributing to additional changes in correlations within the channel's sojourns in subsequent states. Similarly, the correlations may be affected by processes proceeding at longer time scales, like interactions with the channel's auxiliary domains or lipid surroundings."

Finally, we give perturbative solutions for spin-$3$ SZ flows in any member of our unified class of AF models with underlying $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ algebra. Part of our analysis shows that the class of AF deformations can be extended by allowing the interaction function to depend on a larger set of variables than has previously been considered."

The cases with the constant gravity field with acceleration $g\neq0$ and without external field $g=0$ are considered. The non-integrability proof for $g\neq0$ based on the fact that the equations of motion for the sliding top are a perturbation of the classical top equations of motion. We show that the integrability of the classical top is a necessary condition for the integrability of the sliding top. Among four integrable classical top cases the corresponding two cases for the sliding top are also integrable, and for the two remaining cases, we prove their non-integrability by analyzing the differential Galois group of variational equations along a certain particular solution. In the absence of constant gravitational field $g=0$ the integrability is much more difficult. At first, we proved that if the sliding top problem is integrable, then the body is symmetric. In the proof, we applied one of the Ziglin theorem concerning the splitting of separatrices phenomenon. Then we prove the non-integrability of the symmetric sliding top using differential Galois group of variational equations except two the same as for $g\neq0$ cases.

The dynamics of rarefaction solitary waves holds great potential, yet their fundamental characteristics and interactions remain only partially understood through experimental means in mechanical metamaterials. Previous studies highlighted their existence and proposed applications, such as waveguides, impact mitigation, and energy harvesting. Challenges, including energy dissipation and a lack of precise measurement techniques, have hindered deeper exploration, most notably of solitonic collisions. In this work, we provide a definitive platform for examining pure rarefaction solitons propagating through a strain-softening mechanical lattice, addressing these challenges. Employing a theoretical framework based on the Boussinesq approximation and multiple-scale analysis, we predict soliton behavior, including phase shifts resulting from head-on collisions. These theoretical insights are corroborated through numerical simulations and systematic experiments designed to generate and measure pure rarefaction solitons with high precision. Both symmetric and asymmetric collisions are examined, revealing practically elastic interaction behaviors and amplitude-dependent phase shifts. Furthermore, collision dynamics, such as speed and phase shifts during rarefaction soliton collisions, from the experimental results show agreement with theoretical and numerical models. These results validate our experimental platform and findings, underscoring the potential of mechanical rarefaction solitons as robust, controllable wave packets. This suggests a robust paradigm for exploring nonlinear wave interactions in mechanical systems, opening new application avenues in mechanical metamaterials, such as wave-based computing and advanced signal processing."

Similar to threshold-dependent complex contagions, the nonlinearity in adoption rates poses challenges for mean-field approximations. To address this theoretical gap, we focus on nonlinear binary-opinion dynamics on dynamical networks and analytically derive local configurations, specifically the distribution of opinions within any given focal individual's neighborhood. This exact local configuration of opinions, combined with network degree distributions, allows us to obtain exact solutions for consensus times and evolutionary trajectories. Our counterintuitive results reveal that neither biased assimilation (i.e., nonlinear adoption rates) nor preferences in local network rewiring -- such as in-group bias (preferring like-minded individuals) and the Matthew effect (preferring social hubs) -- can significantly slow down consensus. Among these three social factors, we find that biased assimilation is the most influential in accelerating consensus. Furthermore, our analytical method efficiently and precisely predicts the evolutionary trajectories of adoption curves arising from nonlinear contagion dynamics. Our work paves the way for enabling analytical predictions for general nonlinear contagion dynamics beyond opinion formation."

To address this, we propose a fast modular whole-body modeling framework using Boltzmann-Hamel equations and screw theory, in which each leg's dynamics is modeled independently and assembled based on the current robot morphology. This singularity-free, closed-form formulation enables efficient design of model-based controllers and damage identification algorithms. Its modularity allows autonomous adaptation to various damage configurations without manual re-derivation or retraining of neural networks. We validate the proposed framework using a custom simulation engine that integrates contact dynamics, a gait generator, and local leg control. Comparative simulations against hardware tests on a hexapod robot with multiple leg damage confirm the model's accuracy and adaptability. Additionally, runtime analyses reveal that the proposed model is approximately three times faster than real-time, making it suitable for real-time applications in damage identification and recovery."

Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions."

TL enables models to generalize to out-of-distribution data with minimal training data from the new system. In this study, we employ a 9-layer convolutional NN to predict the subgrid forcing in a two-layer ocean quasi-geostrophic system and examine which metrics best describe its performance and generalizability to unseen dynamical regimes. Fourier analysis of the NN kernels reveals that they learn low-pass, Gabor, and high-pass filters, regardless of whether the training data are isotropic or anisotropic. By analyzing the activation spectra, we identify why NNs fail to generalize without TL and how TL can overcome these limitations: the learned weights and biases from one dataset underestimate the out-of-distribution sample spectra as they pass through the network, leading to an underestimation of output spectra. By re-training only one layer with data from the target system, this underestimation is corrected, enabling the NN to produce predictions that match the target spectra. These findings are broadly applicable to data-driven parameterization of dynamical systems."

Non-Hermitian media ranging from open quantum systems to active materials can sustain wave propagation in so-called $PT$-symmetric states where gain and loss are effectively balanced. Here, we derive the kinetic equations governing wave turbulence in a prototypical non-Hermitian medium: a three-dimensional fluid with odd viscosity. We calculate its exact anisotropic solution, the so-called Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum, and validate the existence of this regime using direct numerical simulations. This non-Hermitian wave turbulence generates a direct cascade that is sustained down to the smallest scales, suppressing the transition to strong turbulence typically observed in rotating fluids and electron magnetohydrodynamics. Beyond odd viscous fluids, this qualitative mechanism applies to any non-linear system of waves where non-Hermitian effects are enhanced at small scales through gradient terms in the dynamical equations, e.g. via odd elastic moduli or other non-reciprocal responses."

To be precise, we demonstrate in this work, that this method does not provide solutions of the associated Weyl (Dirac) equation, nor does it fulfill the boundary conditions imposed on the spinor eigenfunctions to ensure confinement of the particle to the domain of the billiard. We review in detail the wave equation, boundary conditions and quantization of NBs and derivation of relevant equations, to make the proof comprehensible for the general reader. Our results are corroborated with numerical results for non-relativistic and relativistic quantum billiards whose shapes depend on a parameter, which allows the study of the properties of their eigenstates as the classical dynamics experiences a transition from regular to chaotic dynamics."

It has been shown that this principle is essential for consistent understanding of the birth and evolution of life. First, a recent work for the birth of a self-replicative system as pre-RNA life is reviewed in relation to the MEPP. A critical condition of polymer concentration in a local system is reported by a dynamical system approach, above which, an exponential increase of entropy production is guaranteed. Secondly, research works of early stage of evolutions are reviewed; experimental research for the numbers of cells necessary for forming a multi-cellular organization, and numerical research of differentiation of a model system and its relation with MEPP. It is suggested by this review article that the late stage of evolution is characterized by formation of society and external entropy production. A hypothesis on the general route of evolution is discussed from the birth to the present life which follows the MEPP. Some examples of life which happened to face poor thermodynamic condition are presented with thermodynamic discussion. It is observed through this review that MEPP is consistently useful for thermodynamic understanding of birth and evolution of life, subject to a thermodynamic condition far from equilibrium."

Sky-high optical nonlinearities make these materials ideal platforms for photonic integrated circuits. The fabrication of such complex devices could greatly benefit from in-volume ultrafast laser writing for monolithic and contactless integration. Ironically, as exemplified for Si, nonlinearities act as an efficient immune system self-protecting the material from internal permanent modifications that ultrashort laser pulses could potentially produce. While nonlinear propagation of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses has been extensively investigated in Si, other semiconductors remain uncharted. In this work, we demonstrate that filamentation universally dictates ultrashort laser pulse propagation in various semiconductors. The effective key nonlinear parameters obtained strongly differ from standard measurements with low-intensity pulses. Furthermore, the temporal scaling laws for these key parameters are extracted. Temporal-spectral shaping is finally proposed to optimize energy deposition inside semiconductors. The whole set of results lays the foundations for future improvements, up to the point where semiconductors can be selectively tailored internally by ultrafast laser writing, thus leading to countless applications for in-chip processing and functionalization, and opening new markets in various sectors including technology, photonics, and semiconductors."

Both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities are considered. Within the nontrivial regime, in-phase, out-of-phase, and edge modes can emerge within the gap. Numerical results reveal that three types of topological gap solitons bifurcate from their corresponding linear localized modes. The dimerization parameter can be tuned to drive the system from a trivial to a nontrivial configuration. We observe that as the strength of the fourth-order diffraction increases, the size of the spectral gap also enlarges, with this parameter effectively broadening the stability window for solitons. Our findings offer novel insights into the properties of both linear and nonlinear modes in topologically defected structures."

While studies have explored SOP formation in various configurations, no systematic comparison of positive and negative DC glow discharges has been conducted to explain why SOP form exclusively when polarization is negative. This study aims to analyze SOP formation mechanisms by comparing electrical, optical and spectral properties of positive and negative DC glow discharges interacting with a grounded water surface. Key differences in gas temperature, electric field and reactive species distribution are hence identified. For positive DC glow discharges (PGD), the gas temperature remains in the 350-370 K range, while the reduced electric field remains below 100 Td across the gap. The plasma is dominated by OH and N2* species, whose excitation results from direct electron impact and energy transfer in a low-field environment. The absence of strong ionization and electric field gradients leads to a spatially homogeneous emission layer on the liquid surface, resulting in a circular uniform plasma (CUP) pattern without self-organization. In contrast, SOP emerge exclusively under negative DC glow discharges (NGD) at currents above 15 mA. These discharges present a reduced electric field, peaking at 485 Td at 1mm from the cathode pin, dropping below 100 Td in the central gap and rising to 460 Td near the water surface. There, the plasma layer still contains OH and N2* species but also N2+ ions, the latter being critical for SOP formation. SOP morphology evolves with gap size: at 7 mm, patterns transition from specks to filaments, with pattern diameter and thickness as high as 5.5 mm and 210 μm respectively. Lowering water surface tension with surfactants reduces SOP size and modifies pattern morphology."

To date, the precursor of this laminar-turbulent transition is recognized as transient turbulent spots or puffs, but their defining characteristics - longevity, abrupt relaminarization, and super-exponential lifetime scaling - have been lack of first-principles explanations. By combining extensive computer simulations, theory, and verifications with experimental data, we identify distinct puff relaminarizations separated by a critical Reynolds number, which are defined by a noisy saddle-node bifurcation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Below the critical number, the mean lifetime of puff follows a square-root scaling law, representing an intrinsically deterministic decay dominated by the critical slowing down. Above the critical value, the bifurcation's node branch creates a potential well stabilizing the turbulence, while the saddle branch mediates stochastic barrier-crossing events that drive memoryless decay - a hallmark of metastable states. Accordingly, the mean lifetimes are solved theoretically and can be fitted super-exponentially. By quantifying the deterministic and stochastic components in the kinetic energy equation, the lifetime statistics of puff are analyzed in a unified framework across low-to-moderate Reynolds number regimes, uncovering the mechanisms governing the transition to metastable turbulence in pipe flows."

This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation."

These physical `gliders' robustly emerge from an ensemble of individually undulating three-link two-motor robots and can remain bound for hundreds of undulations and travel for multiple robot dimensions. Gliders occur in two distinct binding symmetries and form over a wide range of angular oscillation extent. This parameter sets the maximal concavity which influences formation probability and translation characteristics. Analysis of dynamics in simulation reveals the mechanism of effective dynamical attraction -- a result of the emergent interplay of appropriately oriented and timed repulsive interactions. Tactile sensing stabilizes the short-lived conformation via concavity modulation.

For such two-dimensional spatial solitons with their width as just about one wavelength, all the three components of electric field are essential. Since the solitons are ``saddle points'' of some functional, the numerical method used here is a relaxation procedure, with the functional being minimized on stable modes, and maximized on almost all unstable modes. The only remaining unstable mode of common amplitude is stabilized by fixing the energy flux across the beam cross-section."

Previous methods, particularly those from statistical physics, primarily focus on the analysis of mesoscopic network structures and often struggle to integrate fine-grained node similarities. To address this limitation, we propose a low-complexity framework that integrates machine learning to embed micro-level node-pair similarities into mesoscopic community structures. By leveraging ensemble learning models, our approach enhances both structural coherence and detection accuracy. Experimental evaluations on artificial and real-world networks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher modularity and improved accuracy in NMI and ARI. Notably, when ground-truth labels are available, our approach yields the most accurate detection results, effectively recovering real-world community structures while minimizing misclassifications. To further explain our framework's performance, we analyze the correlation between node-pair similarity and evaluation metrics. The results reveal a strong and statistically significant correlation, underscoring the critical role of node-pair similarity in enhancing detection accuracy. Overall, our findings highlight the synergy between machine learning and statistical physics, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can enhance network analysis and uncover complex structural patterns."

Chaotic systems are prevalent throughout the world today: in weather patterns, disease outbreaks, and even financial markets. Chaotic systems are seen in every field of science and humanities, so being able to predict these systems is greatly beneficial to society. In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and neural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for their ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by generating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time using the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations (ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach, predicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However, to more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we transitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network on many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles, or 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also evaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded that for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both friction and frictionless scenarios. For triple pendulum, the Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)[4] was the best for the sliding window and Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) [5] was the best for the time step approach, but for friction, LSTM was the best."

The DLA formations observed in nature are mostly a result of various kinds of inanimate particles diffusing and aggregating.

In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns."

Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the primary smooth or non-smooth deterministic dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing unobserved nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters is studied in two illustrative examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire system. It is demonstrated that denoising performance improves by truncating redundant nodes and edges of the reservoir, as well as by properly optimizing hyperparameters, such as the leakage rate, spectral radius, input connectivity, and ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen and qualitatively different attractors. Compared to the extended Kalman filter, the presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios and high-frequency ranges."

Giorgini', 'Fabrizio Falasca', 'Andre N.

The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations."

We show that the solitary wave solutions exist in the entire allowed $(κ,p)$ plane for $ω/m > 1/p^{1/(κ+1)} $, for frequency $ω$ and mass $m$. These solutions have the property that their energy divided by their charge is $\it {independent} $ of the coupling constant $g$. As $ω$ increases, there is a transition from the double humped to the single humped solitons. We discuss the regions of stability of these solutions as a function of $ω,p,κ$ using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. Finally we discuss the non-relativistic reduction of the 2-parameter family of generalized ABS models to a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) and discuss the stability of the solitary waves in the domain of validity of the modified NLSE."

For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator."

However, the limited availability of detailed ecological data, especially for complex ecological interactions creates uncertainty in model predictions, often requiring adjustments to the mathematical formulation of these interactions. Modifying the mathematical representation of components responsible for complex behaviors, such as predation, can further contribute to this uncertainty, a phenomenon known as structural sensitivity. Structural sensitivity has been explored primarily in non-spatial systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and in a limited number of simple, spatially extended systems modeled by nonhomogeneous parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), where self-diffusion alone cannot produce spatial patterns. In this study, we broaden the scope of structural sensitivity analysis to include spatio-temporal ecological systems in which spatial patterns can emerge due to diffusive instability. Through a combination of analytical techniques and supporting numerical simulations, we show that pattern formation can be highly sensitive to how the system and its associated ecological interactions are mathematically parameterized. In fact, some patterns observed in one version of the model may completely disappear in another with a different parameterization, even though the underlying properties remain unchanged."

Dynamic indicators for chaos detection have proven to be very effective in finding and distinguishing the weakly-chaotic regions of phase space where diffusion takes place and regions that remain stable over time scales in the order of multiple hours of continuous operation.

In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data."

2504.12621,Revisiting multifunctionality in reservoir computing,['nlin.CD'],"['Swarnendu Mandal', 'Kazuyuki Aihara']","Multifunctionality is ubiquitous in biological neurons. Several studies have translated the concept to artificial neural networks as well. Recently, multifunctionality in reservoir computing (RC) has gained the widespread attention of researchers. Multistable dynamics of the reservoir can be configured to capture multiple tasks, each by one of the co-existing attractors. However, there are several limitations in the applicability of this approach. So far, multifunctional RC has been shown to be able to reconstruct different attractor climates only when the attractors are well separated in the phase space. We propose a more flexible reservoir computing scheme capable of multifunctioning beyond the earlier limitations. The proposed architecture holds striking similarity with the multifunctional biological neural networks and showcases superior performance. It is capable of learning multiple chaotic attractors with overlapping phase space. We successfully train the RC to achieve multifunctionality with wide range of tasks."
2504.12530,The effect of timescale separation on the tipping window for chaotically forced systems,"['nlin.CD', 'math.DS']","['Raphael Römer', 'Peter Ashwin']","Tipping behaviour can occur when an equilibrium loses stability in response to a slowly varying parameter crossing a bifurcation threshold, or where noise drives a system from one attractor to another, or some combination of these effects. Similar behaviour can be expected when a multistable system is forced by a chaotic deterministic system rather than by noise. In this context, the chaotic tipping window was recently introduced and investigated for discrete-time dynamics. In this paper, we find tipping windows for continuous-time nonlinear systems forced by chaos. We characterise the tipping window in terms of forcing by unstable periodic orbits of the chaos, and we show how the location and structure of this window depend on the relative timescales between the forcing and the responding system. We illustrate this by finding tipping windows for two examples of coupled bistable ODEs forced with chaos. Additionally, we describe the dynamic tipping window in the setting of a changing system parameter."

Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics."

When topological systems are extended into the nonlinear regime, linear topological edge states bifurcate into nonlinear counterparts, and topological gap solitons emerge in the bulk of the structures. Despite extensive studies of these two types of nonlinear states, self-induced topological edge states localized at the physical boundaries of originally nontopological structures remain underexplored. Unlike the previously reported self-induced topological transitions driven by nonlinear couplings, which are conceptually straightforward but less common in realistic interacting systems, here we experimentally realize self-induced topological edge states in a lattice with onsite nonlinearity. Leveraging the strong and tunable nonlinearity of electrical circuits, we systematically investigate the localized states in a nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Besides revisiting the nonlinear topological edge states and topological gap solitons, we uncover a novel type of self-induced topological edge states which exhibit the hallmark features of linear topological edge states, including sublattice polarization, phase jumps, and decaying tails that approach zero. A distinctive feature of these states is the boundary-induced power threshold for existence. Our results are broadly applicable and can be readily extended to photonic and cold atomic systems, where onsite nonlinearities naturally arise from interparticle interactions. Our work unveils new opportunities for exploring novel correlated topological states of light and matter, and paves the way for the development of robust photonic devices and topological quantum computation."

Moreover, in systems with game transitions, the proportion of higher-order interactions has a dual impact, either enhancing the emergence and persistence of cooperation or facilitating invasions that promote defection within an otherwise cooperative system. Correspondingly, bistable states, consisting of mutual defection and either mutual cooperation or coexistence, are consistently identified in both theoretical analyses and simulation results."

Gordon', 'Anastasia Bizyaeva']","We propose and analyze a model for the dynamics of the flow into and out of a nest for the arboreal turtle ant $\textit{Cephalotes goniodontus}$ during foraging to investigate a possible mechanism for the emergence of oscillations. In our model, there is mixed dynamic feedback between the flow of ants between different behavioral compartments and the amount of pheromone along trails. On one hand, the ants deposit pheromone along the trail, which provides a positive feedback by increasing rates of return to the nest. On the other hand, pheromone evaporation is a source of negative feedback, as it depletes the pheromone and inhibits the return rate. We prove that the model is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of pheromone feedback. Then we show that pheromone feedback can lead to a loss of stability of the equilibrium and onset of sustained oscillations in the flow in and out of the nest via a Hopf bifurcation. This analysis sheds light on a potential key mechanism that enables arboreal turtle ants to effectively optimize their trail networks to minimize traveled path lengths and eliminate graph cycles."

In such a theory, the Skyrme field takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. We also use the holomorphic map ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow G/H \times U(1)$ to study the self-dual sector of the theory, which generalizes the holomorphic ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow CP^N$. This ansatz is constructed using the fact that stable harmonic maps of the two $S^2$ spheres for compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. Apart from some special cases, the self-duality equations do not fix the matrix $h$ entirely in terms of the Skyrme field, which is completely free, as it happens in the original self-dual Skyrme model for $G=SU(2)$. In general, the freedom of the $h$ fields tend to grow with the dimension of $G$. The holomorphic ansatz enable us to construct an infinite number of exact self-dual Skyrmions for each integer value of the topological charge and for each value of $N \geq 1$, in case of the $CP^N$, and for each values of $p,\,q\geq 1$ in case of $SU(p+q)/SU(p)\otimes SU(q)\otimes U(1)$."

Jensen', 'Bryan T. Grenfell']","The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae are characterized by complex and poorly understood multiannual cycles, posing challenges for forecasting. Using Bayesian methods to fit a seasonally forced transmission model to long-term surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025), we investigate the mechanisms driving recurrent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae. The period of the multiannual cycles (predominantly approx. 5 years in Denmark) are explained as a consequence of the interaction of two time-scales in the system, one intrinsic and one extrinsic (seasonal). While it provides an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), we find that the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, failing to reproduce the observed 4-5-year periodicity long-term. Upon further analysis, the system is found to exhibit transient chaos and thus high sensitivity to stochasticity. We show that environmental (but not purely demographic) stochasticity can sustain the multi-year cycles via stochastic resonance. The disruptive effects of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on M. pneumoniae circulation constitute a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations of deterministic epidemic models for long-term prediction. More generally, our results emphasize the potential role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens."

We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurement of a bit, the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming this via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to prediction and retrodiction. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable measures that characterize a process' informational structure. In addition, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of complex multivariate systems.

In particular, we focus on a reduction where the probability measure is induced by a Hamiltonian expressed as a formal series of even interaction terms. We show that the order parameters for the unitary ensemble, that is associated with the Volterra lattice, provide a solution of the modified KP equation. The analogous reduction for the orthogonal ensemble, associated with the Pfaff lattice, leads to a new integrable chain. A key step for the calculation of order parameters for the orthogonal ensemble is the evaluation of the initial condition by using a map from orthogonal to skew-orthogonal polynomials. The thermodynamic limit leads to an integrable system (a chain for the orthogonal ensemble)of hydrodynamic type. Intriguingly, we find that the solution to the initial value problem for both the discrete system and its continuum limit are given by the very same semi-discrete dynamical chain."

The velocity statistics are governed by the Euler ensemble, obtained previously as a spontaneously stochastic solution to the loop equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in the extreme turbulent limit. The resulting advection-diffusion problem is solved explicitly via loop calculus. For an initially localized scalar distribution, the solution develops a sequence of concentric spherical shells with a quantized, piecewise-parabolic radial profile of temperature and a finite limit at the center -- an outcome not predicted by conventional theories. This shell structure is the unique solution of the transport equation within the Euler ensemble, but may be smeared by finite diffusivity or forcing. It represents the geometric skeleton of scalar transport in ideal turbulence, and may be relevant in astrophysical or quantum-fluid regimes where dissipation is negligible. This work redefines expectations for scalar mixing in the high-Reynolds-number limit."

We demonstrate in both focusing and defocusing regimes, the excitation and existence diagram of a class of nondegenerate Akhmediev breathers formed by nonlinear superposition between several fundamental breathers with the same unstable frequency but corresponding to different eigenvalues. The role of such excitation in higher-order MI is revealed by considering the nonlinear evolution starting with a pair of unstable frequency sidebands. It is shown that the spectrum evolution expands over several higher harmonics and contains several spectral expansion-contraction cycles. In particular, abnormal unstable frequency jumping over the stable gaps between the instability bands are observed in both defocusing and focusing regimes. We outline the initial excitation diagram of abnormal frequency jumping in the frequency-wavenumber plane.

Here we focus on rhythmic phenomena, where phase reduction theory shows that synchronization dynamics can be universally described by coupled phase oscillators. Estimating the interaction functions of such systems from data offers a direct path to understanding and predicting such dynamics. Existing Fourier-series-based methods encounter difficulties with limited or biased data. To overcome this, we employ Gaussian process regression with additive periodic kernels. In our approach, we incorporate information about the estimation target into the statistical model in advance by designing kernel functions that capture the characteristics -- additivity and $2π$-periodicity -- of the coupling functions. Furthermore, owing to the Bayesian framework, our method enables the evaluation of uncertainty in the estimation results. We validate our approach on Van der Pol, FitzHugh-Nagumo, and spiking neural models. Our approach outperforms Fourier-series baselines in both error and stability under biased phase sampling. This enables data-driven studies of rhythm dynamics across a broader range of datasets. Furthermore, it makes a first step toward a statistically grounded, data-driven approach to general many-body systems with two-body interactions."

Fast neural dynamics establish metastable states, while slow neural dynamics maintain task-relevant information and modulate the stability of these states to enable temporal processing. We systematically analyzed how factors such as neuronal gain, external input strength (contextual cues), and task difficulty influence the temporal properties of neural activity sequences - specifically, dwell time within patterns and transition times between successive patterns. We found that these factors flexibly modulate the stability of metastable states. Our findings provide a unified mechanism for understanding various forms of temporal modulation and suggest a novel computational role for neural timescale diversity in dynamically adapting cognitive performance to changing environmental demands."

The ${\mathrm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system is a class of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations of second order with significant implications in integrable systems, quantum field theory, and differential geometry. Building on the work of A. Eremenko (J. Math. Phys. Anal. Geom., Volume 3 p.39-46), Jingyu Mu's thesis, and others, we obtain the classification of such solutions by leveraging techniques from the Nevanlinna theory. In particular, we prove that the unitary curve corresponding to a solution with polynomial energy growth to the ${\mathrm SU}(n+1)$ Toda system on $\mathbb{C}^*$ gives a set of fundamental solutions to a linear homogeneous ODE of $(n+1)^{th}$ order, and each coefficient of the ODE can be written as a sum of a polynomial in $z$ and another one in $\frac{1}{z}$."

Andrecut'],"Populations of agents often exhibit surprising collective behavior emerging from simple local interactions. The common belief is that the agents must posses a certain level of cognitive abilities for such an emerging collective behavior to occur. However, contrary to this assumption, it is also well known that even noncognitive agents are capable of displaying nontrivial behavior. Here we consider an intermediate case, where the agents borrow a little bit from both extremes. We assume a population of agents performing random-walk in a bounded environment, on a square lattice. The agents can sense their immediate neighborhood, and they will attempt to move into a randomly selected empty site, by avoiding collisions.Also, the agents will temporary stop moving when they are in contact with at least two other agents. We show that surprisingly, such a rudimentary population of agents undergoes a percolation phase transition and self-organizes in a large polymer like structure, as a consequence of an attractive entropic force emerging from their restricted-valence and local spatial arrangement."

We propose the ""Information Dilution Theorem,"" demonstrating that as dimensionality ($d$) increases, the mutual information efficiency between geometric metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) and system states decays approximately as $O(1/d)$. This decay arises from the mismatch between linearly growing system entropy and sublinearly growing metric entropy, explaining the mechanism behind distance concentration. Building on this, we introduce information structural complexity ($C(S)$) based on the mutual information matrix spectrum and interaction encoding capacity ($C'$) derived from information bottleneck theory. The ""Emergence Critical Theorem"" states that when $C(S)$ exceeds $C'$, new global features inevitably emerge, satisfying a predefined mutual information threshold. This provides an operational criterion for self-organization and phase transitions. We discuss potential applications in physics, biology, and deep learning, suggesting potential directions like MI-based manifold learning (UMAP+) and offering a quantitative foundation for analyzing emergence across disciplines."

Here, we propose a novel Ising machine that exploits the three-dimensional nature of nonlinear polarization oscillators to counteract these limitations. Based on the evolution of the optical polarization in third-order nonlinear media, the high-dimensional machine reaches the Ising ground state by the mechanism of dimensional collapse: the dynamics on the Poincaré sphere undergoes a self-induced collapse into polarization fixed points mapping Ising spins. The photonic setup consists of polarization-modulated pulses in a $χ^{(3)}$ crystal subject to iterative feedback. We numerically demonstrate that its high-dimensional operation leads to an enhanced success probability on benchmark graphs and an exponential improvement in performance scaling with respect to coherent Ising machines. The proposed polarization Ising machine paves the way for a new class of Ising solvers with enhanced computing capabilities."

By embedding Large Language Model (LLM) agents within an evolutionary game-theoretic framework, this paper investigates the complex interplay between AI developers, regulators and users, modelling their strategic choices under different regulatory scenarios. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by each actor, and LLMs provide additional degrees of complexity and nuances and enable repeated games and incorporation of personality traits. Our research identifies emerging behaviours of strategic AI agents, which tend to adopt more ""pessimistic"" (not trusting and defective) stances than pure game-theoretic agents. We observe that, in case of full trust by users, incentives are effective to promote effective regulation; however, conditional trust may deteriorate the ""social pact"". Establishing a virtuous feedback between users' trust and regulators' reputation thus appears to be key to nudge developers towards creating safe AI. However, the level at which this trust emerges may depend on the specific LLM used for testing. Our results thus provide guidance for AI regulation systems, and help predict the outcome of strategic LLM agents, should they be used to aid regulation itself."
2504.08522,Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight,"['nlin.SI', 'math-ph', 'math.CA']","['Peter A.

It is known that the recurrence coefficients $β_n$ satisfy a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation, which is a special case of the second member of the discrete Painlevé I hierarchy, often known as the ''string equation''. The recurrence coefficients have been studied in the context of Hermitian one-matrix models and random symmetric matrix ensembles with researchers in the 1990s observing ''chaotic, pseudo-oscillatory'' behaviour. More recently, this ''chaotic phase'' was described as a dispersive shockwave in a hydrodynamic chain. Our emphasis is a comprehensive study of the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as the parameters $τ$ and $t$ vary. Extensive computational analysis is carried out, using Maple, for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases in terms of generalised hypergeometric functions and modified Bessel functions. The results highlight the rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems."

All these processes took place in a given environmental context and required both molecular diversity and the right non-equilibrium conditions to sustain and favour complex self-sustaining molecular networks capable of evolving by natural selection. Life is a process that departs from non-life in several ways and cannot be reduced to standard chemical reactions. Moreover, achieving higher levels of complexity required the emergence of novelties. How did that happen? Here, we review different case studies associated with the early origins of life in terms of phase transitions and bifurcations, using symmetry breaking and percolation as two central components. We discuss simple models that allow for understanding key steps regarding life origins, such as molecular chirality, the transition to the first replicators and cooperators, the problem of error thresholds and information loss, and the potential for ""order for free"" as the basis for the emergence of life."

Täuber', 'Mauro Mobilia']","Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models."

We consider situations in which the soliton passes through the DSW region quickly enough and does not get trapped in it. The idea is to consider the motion of such solitons through DSW as motion along some smooth effective profile. In the case of KdV and modified KdV, based on the law of conservation of momentum and the equation of motion, this idea is proven rigorously; for other cases of generalized KdV, we take this as a natural generalization. In specific cases of self-similar decays for KdV and modified KdV, a method for selecting an effective field is demonstrated. For the case of generalized KdV, a hypothesis is proposed for selecting an effective field for any wave pulse that is not very large compared to the soliton. All proposed suggestions are numerically tested and demonstrate a high accuracy of reliability."

In this paper, we extend these considerations to $(1+1)$-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) with boundaries. In the presence of a boundary, one can define not only the bulk S-matrix but also the boundary S-matrix, which is subject to a consistency condition known as the boundary crossing relation. We show that when the boundary is weakly-symmetric under the non-invertible symmetry, the conventional boundary crossing relation also receives a modification due to the TQFT effects. As a concrete example of the boundary scattering, we analyze kink scattering in the gapped theory obtained from the $Φ_{(1,3)}$-deformation of a minimal model. We explicitly construct the boundary S-matrix that satisfies the Ward-Takahashi identities associated with non-invertible symmetries."

However, measuring or controlling its dynamics remains a major conceptual and experimental challenge due to its transient and chaotic nature. Here we use a combination of experiments, theory and simulations to show that small magnetic particles of different densities, exploring flow regions of distinct vorticity statistics, can act as effective probes for measuring and forcing turbulence at its smallest scale. The interplay between the magnetic torque, from an externally controllable magnetic field, and hydrodynamic stresses, from small-scale turbulent vorticity, reveals an extremely rich phenomenology. Notably, we present the first observation of stochastic resonance for particles in turbulence: turbulent fluctuations, effectively acting as noise, counterintuitively enhance the particle rotational response to external forcing. We identify a pronounced resonant peak in particle rotational phase-lag when the applied magnetic field matches the characteristic intensity of small-scale vortices. Furthermore, we uncover a novel symmetry-breaking mechanism: an oscillating magnetic field with zero-mean angular velocity remarkably induces net particle rotation in turbulence with zero-mean vorticity, as turbulent fluctuations aid the particle in ""surfing"" the magnetic field. Our findings offer insights into flexible particle manipulation in complex flows and open up a novel magnetic resonance-based approach for measuring vorticity: magnetic particles as probes emit detectable magnetic fields, enabling turbulence quantification even under optically-inaccessible conditions."

Interactions that induce alignment are essential for flocking; however, alignment alone is generally insufficient to maintain group cohesion in the presence of noise, leading traditional models to introduce artificial boundaries or explicit attractive forces. Here, we propose a model that achieves cohesive flocking through purely alignment-based interactions by introducing predictive alignment, in which agents reorient to maximize alignment with the prevailing orientations of their anticipated future neighbors. Implemented in a discrete-time Vicsek-type framework, this approach delivers robust, noise-resistant cohesion without additional parameters. In the stable regime, flock size scales linearly with interaction radius, remaining nearly immune to noise or propulsion speed, and the group coherently follows a leader under noise. These findings reveal how predictive strategies enhance self-organization, paving the way for a new class of active matter models blending physics and cognitive-like dynamics."

Results show that synchronization is sensitive to both the frequency and amplitude of auditory input, with synchronization enhanced when input frequencies align with the system's intrinsic frequencies. Increased stimulus amplitude broadens the synchronization range governed by a delicate interplay involving the network's topology, the spatial location of the input, and the frequency characteristics of the cortical input signals. This perspective article also reveals that brain activity alternates between synchronized and desynchronized states, reflecting critical dynamics and phase transitions in neural networks. Notably, gamma-band synchronization is crucial for processing music, with coherence peaking in this frequency range. The findings emphasize the role of structural connectivity and network topology in modulating synchronization, providing insights into how music perception engages brain networks. This perspective article offers a computational framework for understanding neural mechanisms in music perception, with potential implications for cognitive neuroscience and music psychology."

Here, we demonstrate that small differences in the nodes give rise to desynchronization events, known as bubbling, in regimes where synchronization is expected. Thus, small unit heterogeneity in all real systems has an unexpected and outsized effect on the network dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis of bubbling in chaotic oscillator networks and predict when bubble-free behavior is expected. Our work demonstrates that the domain of network synchronization is much smaller than expected and is replaced by epochs of synchronization interspersed with extreme events. Our findings have important implications for real-world systems where synchronized behavior is crucial for system functionality."

We propose an extension of the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS) strategy for such systems, under which individuals use a resource iteratively until they are unsuccessful and then shift randomly. This simple strategy leads to a distribution of the use of commons with an improvement against random shifting. Selective individuals who retain information on their usage and accordingly adapt their tolerance to failure in each common good improve the average experienced quality for an entire population. Hybrid systems of selective and non-selective individuals can lead to an equilibrium with equalised experienced quality akin to the ideal free distribution. We show that these results can be applied to the server selection problem faced by mobile users accessing Internet services and we perform realistic simulations to test their validity. Furthermore, these findings can be used to understand other real systems such as animal dispersal on grazing and foraging land, and to propose solutions to operators of systems of public transport or other technological commons."

We measure two coexisting kinetic energy cascades, $\mathcal{E}_{\rm kin}(k) \propto k^{-n}$, in the turbulence, separating the plasma into scales that are non-locally interacting, supersonic and weakly magnetized $(n=2.01\pm 0.03\approx 2)$ and locally interacting, subsonic and highly magnetized $(n=1.465\pm 0.002\approx 3/2)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber.

We prove that it is not possible that both the density and the velocity are in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for the self-similar solutions of these problems in general. This indicates that the self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are of much more complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow; in particular, the density and the velocity are not necessarily continuous in the subsonic domain. The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic Euler system to derive the transport equation for the vorticity, a renormalization argument extended to the case of domains with boundary, and DiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates."

We obtain the eigenmodes and the dynamic propagation of an initially localized excitation in closed form as a function of the fractional exponent and the strength of the external potential. We find an oscillation period equal to that of the non-fractional case. The participation ratio is computed in closed form and it reveals that localization of the modes increases with a deviation from the standard case, and with an increase of the external constant field. When nonlinear effects are included, a competition between the tendency to Bloch oscillate, and the trapping tendency typical of the Kerr effect is observed, which ultimately obliterates the BO in the limit of large nonlinearity."

Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role."

Fiderer', 'Paul C. Barth', 'Isaac D. Smith', 'Hans J. Briegel']","Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems."
2504.06187,Scaling Invariance: A Gateway to Phase Transitions,['nlin.CD'],['Edson D. Leonel'],"We explore the concept of scaling invariance in a type of dynamical systems that undergo a transition from order (regularity) to disorder (chaos). The systems are described by a two-dimensional, nonlinear mapping that preserves the area in the phase space. The key variables are the action and the angle, as usual from Hamiltonian systems. The transition is influenced by a control parameter giving the form of the order parameter. We observe a scaling invariance in the average squared action within the chaotic region, providing evidence that this change from regularity (integrability) to chaos (non-integrability) is akin to a second-order or continuous phase transition. As the order parameter approaches zero, its response against the variation of the control parameter (susceptibility) becomes increasingly pronounced (indeed diverging), resembling a phase transition. These findings could not be obtained without a seminal paper on Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 2004}, {\em 93}, 014101."
2504.05944,Laminar chaos in systems with random and chaotically time-varying delay,['nlin.CD'],"['David Müller-Bender', 'Rahil N.

E 107, 014205 (2023)] time-varying delay. Compared to high-dimensional turbulent chaos that is typically found in such systems with large constant delay, laminar chaos is a very low-dimensional phenomenon. It is characterized by a time series with nearly constant laminar phases that are interrupted by irregular bursts, where the intensity level of the laminar phases varies chaotically from phase to phase. In this paper, we demonstrate that laminar chaos, and its generalizations, can also be observed in systems with random and chaotically time-varying delay. Moreover, while for periodic and quasiperiodic delays the appearance of (generalized) laminar chaos and turbulent chaos depends in a fractal manner on the delay parameters, it turns out that short-time correlated random and chaotic delays lead to (generalized) laminar chaos in almost the whole delay parameter space, where the properties of circle maps with quenched disorder play a crucial role. It follows that introducing such a delay variation typically leads to a drastic reduction of the dimension of the chaotic attractor of the considered systems. We investigate the dynamical properties and generalize the known methods for detecting laminar chaos in experimental time series to random and chaotically time-varying delay."

Modern approaches incorporate social norms, mobility patterns, and heterogeneous community structures to capture the interplay between social and biological dynamics. This study examines epidemic propagation in hierarchically structured metapopulation networks, where individuals interact within localized communities -- such as schools, workplaces, and theaters -- and diffuse across them. Using mean-field averaging, we derive a scaling law linking contagion rates to the mean connectivity degree, while stability analysis identifies thresholds for infection surges. In networks with heterogeneous mean degrees, spectral perturbation theory reveals how structural variability accelerates and amplifies disease spreading. We find that nodes with above-average degrees are not only infected earlier but also act as key outbreak drivers. Framing epidemic dynamics as a continuous phase transition, we apply pattern formation theory to show that the critical eigenvectors governing system stability are shaped by the network's degree distribution. Crucially, by analyzing Laplacian eigenvector localization, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between community infection densities and the entries of the critical eigenvector -- revealing how internal community structure directly shapes global infection patterns. This work provides a systematic framework for understanding and predicting epidemic dynamics in structured populations, while highlighting the fundamental role of community organization."

In this system, we report seven equilibria and 26 periodic orbits, all new and linearly unstable. These orbits, together with four previously studied in Zheng et al. (2024b) bring the number of periodic orbit branches computed so far to 30, all solutions to the fully non-linear three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations. These new invariant solutions capture intricate spatio-temporal flow patterns including straight, oblique, wavy, skewed and distorted convection rolls, as well as bursts and defects in rolls. These interesting and important fluid mechanical processes in a small flow unit are shown to appear locally and instantaneously in a chaotic simulation in a large domain. Most of the solution branches show rich spatial and/or spatio-temporal symmetries. The bifurcation-theoretic organisation of these solutions is discussed; the bifurcation scenarios include Hopf, pitchfork, saddle--node, period-doubling, period-halving, global homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, as well as isolas. These orbits are shown to be able to reconstruct statistically the core part of the attractor, and these results may pave the way to quantitatively describing transitional fluid turbulence using periodic orbit theory."

Using multiple reservoirs in parallel has shown improved performances for these predictions, by effectively reducing the input dimensionality of each reservoir. Similarly, one may further reduce the dimensionality of the input data by transforming to a lower-dimensional latent space. Combining both approaches, we show that using dimensionality-reduced latent space predictions for parallel reservoir computing not only reduces computational costs, but also leads to better prediction results for small to medium reservoir sizes. In the combined approach we further demonstrate that dimensionality reduction improves small-reservoir predictions regardless of noise contaminating the training data. The benefit of dimensionality-reduced parallel reservoir computing is illustrated and evaluated on the basis of the prediction of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation."

In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative, namely, subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and non-equilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder.

This implies that orthogonal separation of variables on a symmetric space of rank 1 is possible only in the constant sectional curvature case.

The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency."

Take the example of spoken language, which is characterised by a highly variable and complex set of physical movements that map onto the small set of cognitive units that comprise language. What are the fundamental dynamical principles behind the movements that structure speech production? In this study, we discover models in the form of symbolic equations that govern articulatory gestures during speech. A sparse symbolic regression algorithm is used to discover models from kinematic data on the tongue and lips. We explore these candidate models using analytical techniques and numerical simulations, and find that a second-order linear model achieves high levels of accuracy, but a nonlinear force is required to properly model articulatory dynamics in approximately one third of cases. This supports the proposal that an autonomous, nonlinear, second-order differential equation is a viable dynamical law for articulatory gestures in speech. We conclude by identifying future opportunities and obstacles in data-driven model discovery and outline prospects for discovering the dynamical principles that govern language, brain and behaviour."

The number of solitons is primarily determined by driving strength. Additionally, we identify a novel nonlinear state in parametric soliton crystals in which circulating solitons periodically alternate their intensities and group velocities, a phenomenon we term the soliton-pursuing states. Furthermore, due to the phase-selective nature of the optical parametric process, we show how different configurations of soliton phases influence the optical frequency combs, which may enable generating odd harmonic combs."

While the dynamics associated with these attractors may appear chaotic, we prove that chaos cannot occur. The considered class of $n$-dimensional maps allows for any finite number of partitions, separated by various types of discontinuity sets. The key characteristic, beyond discontinuity, is that all functions defining the map have the same real fixed point. These maps cannot have hyperbolic cycles other than the fixed point itself. We consider the two-dimensional case in detail. We prove that in nongeneric cases, the restriction, or the first return, of the map to a segment of straight line is reducible to a piecewise linear circle map. The generic attractor, different from the fixed point, is a weird quasiperiodic attractor, which may coexist with other attractors or attracting sets. We illustrate the existence of these attractors through numerous examples, using functions with different types of Jacobian matrices, as well as with different types of discontinuity sets. In some cases, we describe possible mechanisms leading to the appearance of these attractors. We also give examples in the three-dimensional space. Several properties of this new type of attractor remain open for further investigation."

Lando', 'Sergej Flach']","The observation of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) paradox, namely the lack of equipartition in the evolution of a normal mode in a nonlinear chain on unexpectedly long times, is arguably the most famous numerical experiment in the history of physics. Seventy years after the original publication, most studies in FPUT chains still focus on long wavelength initial states similar to the original paper. It is shown here that all characteristic features of the FPUT paradox are rendered even more striking if modes with short(er) wavelengths are evolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to equipartition, we also provide a simple technique to predict which modes, and in what perturbation order, are excited starting from an initial mode (root) in $α$-FPUT chains. The excitation sequences associated with a root are then numerically shown to spread energy at different speeds, leading to prethermalization regimes that become longer as a function of mode excitation number. This effect is visible in observables such as mode energies and spectral entropies and, surprisingly, also in the time evolution of invariant quantities such as Lyapunov times and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies. Our findings generalize the original FPUT experiment, provide an original look at the paradox's source, and enrich the vast literature dedicated to studying equipartition in classical many-body systems."

The model offers a continuous description of conflicts in system dynamics, interpreted as interactions between neighboring oscillators when their phases lie within defined interaction sectors. The size of the interaction sector can be seen as a measure of vehicle density within clusters moving along contours. The model assumes that oscillators can synchronize their dynamics, using concepts inherited from the Kuramoto model, which effectively accounts for the discrete state effects observed in Buslaev nets. The governing equation for oscillator dynamics incorporates four key factors: deceleration caused by conflicts with neighboring oscillators and the synchronization process, which induces additional acceleration or deceleration. Numerical analysis shows that the system exhibits both familiar properties from classic Buslaev nets, such as metastable synchronization, and novel behaviors, including phase transitions as the interaction sector size changes."

Here, taking the paradigmatic Kuramoto model as an example and considering the scenario of oscillator failures, we propose substituting the failed oscillators with digital twins trained by the data measured from the system evolution. Specifically, leveraging the technique of adaptable reservoir computer (RC) in machine learning, we demonstrate that a single, small-size RC is able to substitute any oscillator in the Kuramoto model such that the time evolution of the synchronization order parameter of the repaired system is identical to that of the original system for a certain time period. The performance of adaptable RC is evaluated in various contexts, and it is found that the sustaining period is influenced by multiple factors, including the size of the training dataset, the overall coupling strength of the system, and the number of substituted oscillators. Additionally, though the synchronization order parameter diverges from the ground truth in the long-term running, the functional networks of the oscillators are still faithfully sustained by the machine substitutions."

This confers physical significance on the artificial numerical noise of DNS of the Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, DNS on a fine mesh should correspond to turbulence under small internal/external physical disturbance, whereas DNS on a sparse mesh corresponds to turbulent flow under large physical disturbance, respectively. The key point is that: all of them have physical meanings and so are correct in terms of their deterministic physics, even if their statistics are quite different. This is illustrated herein. Our paper provides a positive viewpoint regarding the presence of artificial numerical noise in DNS."

Recent research has evaluated the benefit of using flexible reeds for triggering the vortex induced vibration to enhance mixing, as opposed to traditional techniques like rigid blender or static meshes. Inspired by the soft, porous, and moving fish gill lamellae, we proposed a new concept of thermal dispenser that prescribes active pitching motion to the leading edge of an otherwise passively flapping perforated panel. Experimental measurements revealed drastic differences between the steady leaky flow wake behind a statically deflected perforated panel and the periodic shedding wakes with complex vortex structure transitions behind an actuated perforated panel with or without chord-wise flexibility. A semi-empirical simulation of the thermal convection and diffusion takes the experimentally obtained velocity as input and yields the temperature results. Vortex dynamics, Lagrangian coherent structures, and thermal mixing behaviors were analyzed and compared to elucidate the effects of kinematics, perforation, and flexibility on the wake mode transitions, lateral entrainment mixing, and overall heating. Our work provides a foundational understanding of the fluid-structure interactions of perforated bendable panels under active control which has not been described before in the intermediate Reynolds number range. It provides insights for developing an innovative bio-inspired heat or mass dispenser potentially suitable for subtle and small scale applications."

In this paper, we further analyze the learned closure, probing its capabilities and limitations. In particular, we look at joint probability density functions to assess whether cross-correlations are well preserved or if just the mean behavior is captured. Additionally, we investigate the scale invariance of multipliers - ratios between adjacent shells - within the inertial range. Although our model excels in reproducing high-order observables such as flatness, it breaks this known symmetry near the cutoff, indicating a fundamental limitation. We discuss the implications of these findings for subgrid-scale modeling in 3D turbulence and outline directions for future research."
2504.03696,A novel non-specular mechanism for chaotic ray scattering of internal waves in 3D anisotropic stadiums,['nlin.CD'],"['Nimrod Bratspiess', 'Leo R. M. Maas', 'Eyal Heifetz']","Fluids, subject to symmetry breaking by stratification support propagation of anisotropic internal waves - IWs. In the vertical plane, rays representing energy paths obey a non-specular reflection law, as their inclination is solely dictated by their frequency. Although satisfying the linear Poincare equation, in basins having sloping walls, ray dynamics exhibits nonlinear effects such as convergence onto wave-attractors. In contrast, in the horizontal plane of a basin with vertical walls IWs reflect specularly, and follow chaotic ray paths. Here we present a novel analysis of these competing effects in a 3D IW ray billiard of a stadium having sloping walls. We show and explain how varying the walls slope, shifts the ray dynamics between regimes of near-ergodicity, chaotic scattering, and non-chaotic scattering with self-similar patterns, despite the basin being closed. The rich results stemming from the interplay between elliptical ergodicity and hyperbolic focusing relate to a broader context of physical phenomena."
2504.03691,Regional Controllability of Cellular Automata as a SAT Problem,['nlin.CG'],"['Franco Bagnoli', 'Sara Dridi', 'Nazim Fates']","Controllability, one of the fundamental concepts in control theory, consists in guiding a system from an initial state to a desired one within a limited (and possibly minimum) time interval. When the objective is limited to a specific sub-region of the system's domain, the concept is referred to as regional controllability. We examine this notion in the context of Boolean one-dimensional cellular automata of finite length. Depending on the local evolution rule, we investigate whether it is possible to control the evolution of the system by imposing particular values on the boundary conditions. This approach is related to key dynamical properties of CA, specifically chain transitivity and chain mixing. We show that the control problem can be formulated as a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem and can thus be addressed using SAT solvers. We also show how finding shortest paths in the configuration graph allows to determine controllability properties. From our observations we can state that only peripherally-linear rules are fully controllable, while for other rules, the reachability ratio, that is, the fraction of controllable pairs of initial and final configurations, is vanishing when the system size grows."

We explore the properties of energy spreading from an initial state where only a group of particles has non-zero velocities while others are resting. We characterize anomalous diffusion of the active domain via moments and entropies of the energy distribution. Only in the special cases of a single-well potential (hard-particle gas) and of the distance between the particles being half of the potential width does the diffusion have a single scale; otherwise, a multiscale anomalous diffusion is observed."

An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemomechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures."

In this work, we consider a stochastic model of the positive gene autoregulating feedback loop and we probabilistically quantify its resilience, \textit{i.e.}, its ability to preserve the equilibrium associated with a prescribed concentration of TFs, and the corresponding basin of attraction, in the presence of noise. We show that the formation of larger oligomers, corresponding to larger Hill coefficients of the regulation function, and thus to sharper non-linearities, improves the system resilience, even close to critical concentrations of TFs. We also explore a complementary definition of resilience that can be assessed within a stochastic formulation relying on the Fokker-Planck equation. Our formal results are accompanied by numerical simulations."

We examine the CBTTs in a generalized version of the standard map that incorporates the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, known as the Riemann-Liouville Fractional Standard Map (RLFSM). We propose a methodology that uses two quantifiers based solely on the system's time series: the Hurst exponent and the recurrence time entropy, for characterizing such dynamics. This approach allows us to effectively characterize the dynamics of the RLFSM, including regions of CBTT and chaotic behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that regions of CBTT are associated with trajectories that exhibit lower values of these quantifiers compared to strong chaotic regions, indicating weakly chaotic dynamics during the CBTTs."

Chen', 'Sujit S. Datta']","Wormlike micelle (WLM) solutions are abundant in energy, environmental, and industrial applications, which often rely on their flow through tortuous channels. How does the interplay between fluid rheology and channel geometry influence the flow behavior? Here, we address this question by experimentally visualizing and quantifying the flow of a semi-dilute WLM solution in millifluidic serpentine channels. At low flow rates, the base flow is steady and laminar, with strong asymmetry and wall slip. When the flow rate exceeds a critical threshold, the flow exhibits an elastic instability, producing spatially-heterogeneous, unsteady three-dimensional (3D) flow characterized by two notable features: (i) the formation and persistence of stagnant but strongly-fluctuating and multistable ""dead zones"" in channel bends, and (ii) intermittent 3D ""twists"" throughout the bulk flow. The geometry of these dead zones and twisting events can be rationalized by considering the minimization of local streamline curvature to reduce flow-generated elastic stresses. Altogether, our results shed new light into how the interplay between solution rheology and tortuous boundary geometry influences WLM flow behavior, with implications for predicting and controlling WLM flows in a broad range of complex environments."

In an attempt to sense and overcome these dynamical issues, as well as approximate a non-Gaussian distribution, a nudged particle filtering approach has been introduced. In the nudged particle filter method a control term is added, but has the potential drawback of degenerating the weights of the particles. To counter this issue, we introduce an intermediate resampling approach based on the modified Cramér-von Mises distance. The new method is applied to a challenging scenario of the non-chaotic, unforced nonlinear Duffing oscillator, which possesses a separatrix structure. Our results show that it consistently outperforms the standard particle filter with resampling and original nudged particle filter."

The model involves an active investment strategy such that the temporary investment of each of the two firms depends on its relative position in the market. In this work we are interested in a specific regime of evolution referred to as leapfrogging regime, in which each firm has the possibility to dominate the market alternately during some finite period of time. We examine conditions favoring the leapfrogging dynamics of the model by introducing two appropriate variables, namely the sale difference and total sale of the two firms at any time. An analysis of stability of fixed points of the resulting coupled discrete nonlinear equations is carried out, and the bifurcation diagrams of the sale difference and sum with respect to the elasticity coefficient, are generated. A time-series analysis suggests that the leapfrogging regime, characterized by periodic oscillations of the sale difference from positive to negative branches, is stabilized by specific values of characteristic parameters of the model and when in addition the elasticity coefficient, related to the difference in investment strategies of the two firms, is reasonably high. A positive sign of cumulated sales at any time is required to ensure the availability of goods during the leapfrogging dynamics."

Synchronization requires driven constituents, and in such systems, the coupling can be designed to be nonreciprocal. Nonreciprocally coupled oscillators exhibit a rich variety of behavior including active traveling-wave-type states. In this work, we study the interplay of three competing synchronization mechanisms in a setup of two nonreciprocally coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. One of the oscillators is driven externally which induces phase locking. A dissipative interaction leads to antiphase locking, whereas a coherent interaction nurtures bistable phase locking and active states. We approximate the phase diagram of the quantum case by evaluating the synchronization measure of a perturbation expansion of the steady state. Effective unidirectional interactions lead to synchronization blockades between the undriven oscillator and the external drive as well as between both oscillators. Furthermore, we study the phase diagrams of two and three oscillators in the mean-field limit and find highly nontrivial active states."

Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This derivation is rigorous and does not involve any sophisticated mathematics. Our work provides insights into the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition probability, and shows that the Landau-Zener formula can be viewed as a consequence of integrability, though the two-level Landau-Zener Hamiltonian itself does not satisfy the integrability conditions."

However, evolutionary game theorists have mostly tapped into the classical game of complete information where players are completely informed of all other players' payoffs. Of late, there is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the environment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are influenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information about the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like usually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by the players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true state erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may adopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in different perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player would be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an incomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces. In short, we contemplate possibility of natural emergence of symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of Bayesian games and eco-evolutionary games when the players are equipped with inefficient sensory apparatus. Herein, we illustrate this connection using a setup of infinitely large, well-mixed population of players equipped with two actions for exploiting a resource (the environment) at two different rates so that the resource state evolves accordingly. The state of the resource impacts every player's decision of playing particular action. We investigate continuous state environment in the presence of a Gaussian noisy channel. Employing the formalism of replicator dynamics, we find that noisy information can be effective in preventing resource from going extinct."
2504.02301,Synchronization in bus systems with partially overlapping routes,"['physics.soc-ph', 'nlin.AO']","['Sakurako Tanida', 'Thorsten Pöschel']","In an increasingly interconnected world, understanding congestion-related phenomena in transportation and their underlying mechanisms is crucial for improving efficiency. As the transportation system becomes denser, different modes of transportation have more opportunities to interact with each other, giving rise to emergent dynamics that simple models cannot explain. In this study, we investigate the synchronized motion of indirectly coupled transportation modes. We develop a numerical simulation model on a one-dimensional periodic lattice, where each point represents a bus station. In this system, two types of buses operate: multiple local buses with non-overlapping routes, each serving a specific zone, and a single global bus that partially overlaps with the routes of the local buses. We perform numerical simulations to examine how close the arrival times of these buses are to each other -- that is, how synchronized their motions are. When the number of zones is two, three, or five, robust synchronization occurs not only between the global bus and the local buses, but also among the local buses themselves. In contrast, no synchronization is found for other numbers of zones. We developed a mathematical model using self-consistent equations and found that two distinct arrival patterns at the terminals must be considered. A stability analysis reveals which pattern is ultimately realized in the simulations. Our results show that transportation modes can exhibit coherent motion even when sharing only partial or no direct route overlaps. This outcome highlights that emergent behavior depends not only on local interactions but is also strongly shaped by the system's overall structural configuration."

Precisely quantifying this distinction requires a proper definition of the threshold, which has remained elusive in neurodynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel, energy-based threshold definition for excitable circuits grounded in dissipativity theory, specifically using the classical concept of required supply. According to our definition, the threshold corresponds to a local maximum of the required supply, clearly separating subthreshold passive responses from suprathreshold regenerative spikes. We illustrate and validate the proposed definition through analytical and numerical studies of three canonical systems: a simple RC circuit, the FitzHugh--Nagumo model, and the biophysically detailed Hodgkin--Huxley model."

We use a recurrence joint probability based analysis that accounts for the lagged nonlinear dependency between time series, which also allows quantifying the statistical significance, based on a twin surrogates technique of the recurrence analysis. By means of such nonlinear dependence analysis we find that at interannual timescales AM hydrology influences future states of the TNA SSTs from 0 to 2 months later with a 90% to 95% statistical confidence. It also unveils the existence of two-way feedback mechanisms between the variables involved in the processes: (i) precipitation over AM leads the atmospheric pressure gradient between TNA and AM from 0 and 2 month lags, (ii) the pressure gradient leads the trade zonal winds over the TNA from 0 to 3 months and from 7 to 12 months, (iii) the zonal winds lead the SSTs from 0 to 3 months, and (iv) the SSTs lead precipitation over AM by 1 month lag. The analyses were made for time series spanning from 1979 to 2008, and for extreme precipitation events in the AM during the years 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2010.

Systems transiting between chaos and order manifest a potential to compute, as shown with cellular automata and artificial neural networks. We demonstrate that swarm optimization algorithms also exhibit transitions from chaos, analogous to a motion of gas molecules, when particles explore solution space disorderly, to order, when particles follow a leader, similar to molecules propagating along diffusion gradients in liquid solutions of reagents. We analyze these `phase-like' transitions in swarm optimization algorithms using recurrence quantification analysis and Lempel-Ziv complexity estimation. We demonstrate that converging iterations of the optimization algorithms are statistically different from non-converging ones in a view of applied chaos, complexity and predictability estimating indicators.
  An identification of a key factor responsible for the intensity of their phase transition is the main contribution of this paper. We examined an optimization as a process with three variable factors -- an algorithm, number generator and optimization function. More than 9.000 executions of the optimization algorithm revealed that the nature of an applied algorithm itself is the main source of the phase transitions. Some of the algorithms exhibit larger transition-shifting behavior while others perform rather transition-steady computing. These findings might be important for future extensions of these algorithms."

It is first shown that the multiplicity of any multiple root in any Adler--Moser polynomial is a triangular number (i.e., its multiplicity is equal to $n(n+1)/2$ for a certain integer $n$). Then, it is shown that corresponding to a nonzero multiple root of the Adler--Moser polynomial, a triangular rogue cluster would appear on the spatial-temporal plane. This triangular rogue cluster comprises $n(n+1)/2$ fundamental rogue waves forming a triangular shape, and space-time locations of fundamental rogue waves in this triangle are a linear transformation of the Yablonskii--Vorob'ev polynomial $Q_{n}(z)$'s root structure. In the special case where this multiple root of the Adler--Moser polynomial is zero, the associated rogue pattern is found to be a $n$-th order rogue wave in the $O(1)$ neighborhood of the spatial-temporal origin. These general results are demonstrated on two integrable systems: the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the generalized derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation. For these equations, asymptotic predictions of rogue patterns are compared with true rogue solutions and good agreement between them is illustrated."

While very thin films always stay open and very thick films always plug, we find a range of intermediate films for which plugging is uncertain. The fastest-growing linear mode of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability ensures that the film's volume is divided among multiple humps. However, the nonlinear growth of these humps can occur unevenly, due to spontaneous axial sliding -- a lucky hump can sweep up a disproportionate share of the film's volume and so form a plug. This sliding-induced plugging is robust and prevails with or without gravitational and ciliary transport."

However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic systems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from inefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive amount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this challenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system as an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce physics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the echo state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic systems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo state network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can enhance their robustness to variations of training and target system conditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when the coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series data. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other machine-learning methods."

We name these as ``horizontal'' and construct new ``vertical'' intertwiners, which \emph{change the number of interacting particles} for a fixed but integer value of the coupling constant. The emerging structure of a grid of intertwiners exists only in the algebraically integrable situation (integer coupling) and allows one to obtain each Liouville charge from the free power sum in the particle momenta by iterated intertwining either horizontally or vertically. We present recursion formulæ for the intertwiners as a factorization problem for partial differential operators and prove their existence for small values of particle number and coupling. As a byproduct, a new basis of non-symmetric Liouville integrals appears, algebraically related to the standard symmetric one."

Christodoulides']","This paper presents a comprehensive and systematic study of the possible connection between thermalization of cubic nonlinear lattices with nearest-neighbor coupling and the structure of the mixing tensor that arises due to the presence of nonlinearities. The approach is based on rewriting the underlying lattice system as a nonlinear evolution equation governing the dynamics of the modal amplitudes (or projection coefficients). In this formulation, the linear coupling become diagonalizable, whereas all cubic nonlinear terms transform into a combinatorial sum over a product of three modal amplitudes weighted by a fourth-order mixing tensor. We have identified the exact structure of several mixing tensors (corresponding to different types of cubic nonlinearities) and tied their symmetry properties (quasi-Hermiticity and permutation symmetries associated with two lattice conservation laws) with thermalization or lack thereof. Furthermore, we have observed through direct numerical simulations that the modal occupancies of lattices preserving these tensorial symmetries approach a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution at thermal equilibrium. In addition, we provided few examples that indicate that cubic lattices with broken tensorial symmetries end up not to equilibrate to a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution. Finally, an inverse approach to the study of thermalization of cubic nonlinear lattices is developed. It establishes a duality property between lattices in local and modal bases. The idea is to establish a trade-off between the type of nonlinearities in local base and their respective interactions in supermode base. With this at hand, we were able to identify a large class of nonlinear lattices that are embedded in the modal space and admit a simple form that can be used to shed more light on the role that localization (or delocalization) of the supermodes play in thermalization processes."
2504.00556,Importance of near- and far-field coupling for the synchronization of organ pipes,['nlin.AO'],['Jakub Sawicki'],"The synchronization of coupled organ pipes represents a nonlinear phenomenon with significant implications for both musical acoustics and nonlinear dynamics. This study investigates the coupling mechanisms governing synchronization, employing a theoretical framework based on delay-coupled Van der Pol oscillators. The oscillatory behavior of individual organ pipes is modeled as a self-sustained system driven by an air jet interacting with the pipe resonator. By incorporating experimental data and numerical simulations, we analyze the impact of finite separation between coupled pipes, introducing time-delayed interactions in the coupling function. Our findings reveal that synchronization can enhance pitch stability but may also induce sound attenuation due to destructive interference, particularly in prospect pipes. A key focus of this study is the decomposition of the coupling mechanism into near-field and far-field components, each contributing differently to the overall synchronization dynamics. Through bifurcation analysis and Arnold tongue characterization, we demonstrate how distance-dependent interactions influence the stability and frequency locking of coupled oscillators. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is employed to extract spectral features from numerical data, ensuring precise comparison with experiments. Our results show strong qualitative agreement between modeled and observed synchronization effects, highlighting the importance of nonlinear coupling in organ pipe acoustics. This investigation advances the understanding of mutual interactions in coupled acoustic oscillators and provides a refined theoretical basis for predicting synchronization phenomena in complex aerodynamically driven systems."

The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar ""extremal weight property"" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous ""extremal monomial property"" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the ""X-series"" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444."

2504.00028,Chaos and noise in evolutionary game dynamics,"['q-bio.PE', 'cs.GT', 'nlin.CD']","['Maria Alejandra Ramirez', 'George Datseris', 'Arne Traulsen']","Evolutionary game theory has traditionally employed deterministic models to describe population dynamics. These models, due to their inherent nonlinearities, can exhibit deterministic chaos, where population fluctuations follow complex, aperiodic patterns. Recently, the focus has shifted towards stochastic models, quantifying fixation probabilities and analysing systems with constants of motion. Yet, the role of stochastic effects in systems with chaotic dynamics remains largely unexplored within evolutionary game theory. This study addresses how demographic noise -- arising from probabilistic birth and death events -- impacts chaotic dynamics in finite populations. We show that despite stochasticity, large populations retain a signature of chaotic dynamics, as evidenced by comparing a chaotic deterministic system with its stochastic counterpart. More concretely, the strange attractor observed in the deterministic model is qualitatively recovered in the stochastic model, where the term deterministic chaos loses its meaning. We employ tools from nonlinear dynamics to quantify how the population size influences the dynamics. We observe that for small populations, stochasticity dominates, overshadowing deterministic selection effects. However, as population size increases, the dynamics increasingly reflect the underlying chaotic structure. This resilience to demographic noise can be essential for maintaining diversity in populations, even in non-equilibrium dynamics. Overall, our results broaden our understanding of population dynamics, and revisit the boundaries between chaos and noise, showing how they maintain structure when considering finite populations in systems that are chaotic in the deterministic limit."

Tovbis and M. Bertola for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. According to this theory, Peregrine solitons can locally emerge in the semiclassical limit of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Our objective is to determine whether the phenomenon of gradient catastrophe can occur in a class of architected structures designated as flexible mechanical metamaterials, both with and without losses. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that this phenomenon can occur in a canonical example of such flexible mechanical metamaterial, a chain of rotating units, studied earlier for its ability to support robust nonlinear waves such as elastic vector solitons. We find that in the presence of weak losses, the gradient catastrophe persists although the amplitude of extreme generated events is smaller and their onset is delayed compared to the lossless configuration."

This paper investigates the comprehensive influence of multiple reputation-related components on public cooperation. In particular, cooperative investments in public goods game are not fixed but simultaneously depend on the reputation of group organizers and the population's cooperation willingness, hence indirectly impacting on the players' income. Additionally, individual payoff can also be directly affected by their reputation via a weighted approach which effectively evaluates the actual income of players. Unlike conventional models, the reputation change of players is non-monotonic, but may transform abruptly due to specific actions. Importantly, a theoretically supported double Q-learning algorithm is introduced to avoid overestimation bias inherent from the classical Q-learning algorithm. Our simulations reveal a significantly improved cooperation level, that is explained by a detailed Q-value analysis. We also observe the lack of massive cooperative clusters in the absence of network reciprocity. At the same time, as an intriguing phenomenon, some actors maintain moderate reputation and are continuously flipping between cooperation and defection. The robustness of our results are validated by mean-field approximation."

Schmidt'],"Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required. The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation information."

We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, in the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in laser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques."

The machine learning model is created by observing time-series data generated by the Ikeda map, and the trained model is used to forecast the behavior without any input from the map. The Ikeda map is a particularly challenging problem to learn because of the complicated map functions. We overcome the challenge by a novel improvement of the NGRC concept by emphasizing simpler polynomial models localized to well-designed regions of phase space and then blending these models between regions, a method that we call locality blended next-generation reservoir computing (LB-NGRC). This approach allows for better performance with relatively smaller data sets, and gives a new level of interpretability. We achieve forecasting horizons exceeding five Lyapunov times, and we demonstrate that the `climate' of the model is learned over long times."

In this paper, we study the surjunctivity of local perturbations of CA and more generally of non-uniform cellular automata (NUCA) with finite memory and uniformly bounded singularity over surjunctive group universes. In particular, we show that such a NUCA must be invertible whenever it is reversible.

In this work, we apply an integral asymptotics approach to study spatially localized solutions of a heterogeneous generalised Swift-Hohenberg equation. The outer solution is obtained via WKBJ asymptotics, while the inner solution requires the method of coalescing saddles. We modify the classic method of Chester et al. to account for additional technicalities, such as complex branch selection and local transformation to a cubic polynomial. By integrating our results, we construct an approximate global solution to the generalised Swift-Hohenberg problem and validate it against numerical contour integral solutions. We also demonstrate an alternative approach that circumvents the complexity of integral asymptotics by analyzing the original differential equation directly through a multiple-scales analysis and show that this generates the same leading-order inner solution obtained using the coalescing saddles method at least for one of the cases considered via integral asymptotics. Our findings reinforce the significance of integral asymptotics in approximating the fourth order differential equations found in the linear stability analysis for generalisations of the Swift Hohenberg equations. This study has also highlighted a conjecture that, in certain cases, the method of coalescing saddles can be systematically replaced by multiple-scales analysis using an intermediary differential equation, a hypothesis for future investigation."

A major challenge in statistical forecasting of nonlinearly coupled multiscale systems is mitigating the large errors that arise when computing high-order statistical moments. To address this issue, a high-order stochastic-statistical modeling framework is proposed that integrates statistical data assimilation into finite ensemble predictions. The method effectively reduces the approximation errors in finite ensemble estimates of non-Gaussian distributions by employing a filtering update step that incorporates observation data in leading moments to refine the high-order statistical feedback. Explicit filter operators are derived from intrinsic nonlinear coupling structures, allowing straightforward numerical implementations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through extensive numerical experiments on a prototype triad system. The triad system offers an instructive and computationally manageable platform mimicking essential aspects of nonlinear turbulent dynamics. The numerical results show that the statistical data assimilation algorithm consistently captures the mean and covariance, as well as various non-Gaussian probability distributions exhibited in different statistical regimes of the triad system.

Combining ideas from Koopman theory and spectral model order reduction, the stochastic low-dimensional inflated convolutional Koopman model (SLICK) accurately forecasts short-time transient dynamics while preserving long-term statistical properties. A discrete Koopman operator is used to evolve convolutional coordinates that govern the temporal dynamics of spectral orthogonal modes, which in turn represent the energetically most salient large-scale coherent flow structures. Turbulence closure is achieved in two steps: first, by inflating the convolutional coordinates to incorporate nonlinear interactions between different scales, and second, by modeling the residual error as a stochastic source. An empirical dewhitening filter informed by the data is used to maintain the second-order flow statistics within the long-time limit. The model uncertainty is quantified through either Monte Carlo simulation or by directly propagating the model covariance matrix. The model is demonstrated on the Ginzburg-Landau equations, large-eddy simulation (LES) data of a turbulent jet, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) data of the flow over an open cavity. In all cases, the model is predictive over time horizons indicated by a detailed error analysis and integrates stably over arbitrary time horizons, generating realistic surrogate data."

We investigate the role of chaotic instabilities on single particle orbits in leading to nearly-invariant phase-space distributions, aiming at disentangling it from the chaos induced by collective oscillations in the self-consistent potential. We explore as function of the systems size (i.e. number of particles $N$) the chaoticity in terms of the largest Lyapunov exponent of test trajectories in a simplified model of gravitational cold collapse, mimicking a $N-$body calculation via a time dependent smooth potential and a noise-friction process accounting for the discreteness effects. A new numerical method to evaluate effective Lyapunov exponents for stochastic models is presented and tested. We find that the evolution of the phase-space of independent trajectories reproduces rather well what observed in self-consistent $N-$body simulations of dissipationless collapses. The chaoticity of test orbits rapidly decreases with $N$ for particles that remain weakly bounded in the model potential, while it decreases with different power laws for more bound orbits, consistently with what observed in previous self-consistent $N$-body simulations. The largest Lyapunov exponents of ensembles of orbits starting from initial conditions uniformly sampling the accessible phase-space are somewhat constant for $N\lesssim 10^9$, while decreases towards the continuum limit with a power-law trend.

2503.21587,Theory of phase reduction from hypergraphs to simplicial complexes: a general route to higher-order Kuramoto models,"['nlin.AO', 'doi', '10.1016/j.physd.2025.134858']","['Iván León', 'Riccardo Muolo', 'Shigefumi Hata', 'Hiroya Nakao']","Phase reduction is a powerful technique in the study of nonlinear oscillatory systems. Under certain assumptions, it allows us to describe each multidimensional oscillator by a single phase variable, giving rise to simple phase models such as the Kuramoto model. Classically, the method has been applied in the case where the interactions are only pairwise (two-body). However, increasing evidence shows that interactions in real-world systems are not pairwise but higher-order, i.e., many-body. Although synchronization in higher-order systems has received much attention, analytical results are scarce because of the highly nonlinear nature of the framework. In this paper, we fill the gap by presenting a general theory of phase reduction for the case of higher-order interactions. We show that the higher-order topology is preserved in the phase reduced model at the first order and that only odd couplings have an effect on the dynamics when certain symmetries are present. Additionally, we show the power and ductility of the phase reduction approach by applying it to a population of Stuart-Landau oscillators with an all-to-all configuration and with a ring-like hypergraph topology; in both cases, only the analysis of the phase model can provide insights and analytical results."

First, for any group $G$, we consider the category $\mathcal{CA}(G)$ whose objects are configuration spaces of the form $A^G$, where $A$ is a set, and whose morphisms are cellular automata of the form $τ: A_1^G \to A_2^G$. We prove that the categorical product of two configuration spaces $A_1^G$ and $A_2^G$ in $\mathcal{CA}(G)$ is the configuration space $(A_1 \times A_2)^G$. Then, we consider the category of generalized cellular automata $\mathcal{GCA}$, whose objects are configuration spaces of the form $A^G$, where $A$ is a set and $G$ is a group, and whose morphisms are $φ$-cellular automata of the form $\mathcal{T} : A_1^{G_1} \to A_2^{G_2}$, where $φ: G_2 \to G_1$ is a group homomorphism. We prove that a categorical weak product of two configuration spaces $A_1^{G_1}$ and $A_2^{G_2}$ in $\mathcal{GCA}$ is the configuration space $(A_1 \times A_2)^{G_1 \ast G_2}$, where $G_1 \ast G_2$ is the free product of $G_1$ and $G_2$. The previous results allow us to naturally define the product of two cellular automata in $\mathcal{CA}(G)$ and the weak product of two generalized cellular automata in $\mathcal{GCA}$."

King']","We use exponential asymptotic analysis to identify the relevance of Stokes' phenomenon to integrability in discrete systems. We study Stokes' phenomenon in two discrete problems with the same (leading-order) continuous limit, a finite-difference discretisation of the first continuous Painlevé equation and the first discrete Painlevé equation, as well as a family of differential equation associated with each discrete problem. This analysis reveals two important observations. Firstly, the orderly behaviour that characterises Stokes' phenomenon in discrete equations emerges naturally from corresponding continuous differential equations as the order of the latter increases, although this is not apparent at low orders. Secondly, Stokes' phenomenon vanishes in the continuum limit of the integrable discrete equation, but not the non-integrable discrete equation. This means that subdominant exponentials do not appear in the integrable equation, and therefore do not cause moveable singularities to form in the solution. The results are clarified further by consideration of one-parameter family of difference equations that interpolates between the two considered in detail."

Semenov']","Using methods of numerical simulation, we analyze the influence of Lévy noise on synchronization of excitable oscillators in the regime of coherence resonance. Three cases are under consideration: forced synchronization of a single FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator subject to periodic forcing, mutual synchronization of two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators and ensembles of locally and globally coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons. It is demonstrated that Lévy noise provides for transformation of the forced synchronization area such that synchronization can arise or be destroyed through varying the Lévy noise parameters at fixed frequency and amplitude of the external force. Moreover, the Lévy noise intrinsic peculiarity can induce the counterintuitive transformation of the synchronization areas such that increasing the external force amplitude gives rise to leaving the synchronization area. In the context of synchronization of coupled oscillators, Lévy noise is also shown to control the transition to synchronization which can be achieved at lower or higher values of the coupling strength when changing the Lévy noise parameters. However, such effects are found to be exhibited by ensembles of coupled oscillators, whereas the influence of Lévy noise on mutual synchronization of two coupled coherence resonance oscillators is minimal and does not lead to significant changes as compared to Gaussian noise."

Overcoming such complexity has emerged as a central research theme in recent years, motivated both by a wide range of applications -- from wireless communications and imaging to optical micromanipulations -- and by the fundamental principles underlying these efforts. Here, we show that an {\it in-situ} manipulation of the myriad scattering events, achieved through time- and energy-efficient adjoint optimization (AO) methodologies, enables {\it real time} wave-driven functionalities such as targeted channel emission, coherent perfect absorption, and camouflage. Our paradigm shift exploits the highly multi-path nature of these complex environments, where repeated wave-scattering dramatically amplifies small local AO-informed system variations. Our approach can be immediately applied to in-door wireless technologies and incorporated into diverse wave-based frameworks including imaging, power electronic and optical neural networks."

However, as with all modelling, only an approximation is made in the description of the biological and physical system. Here we show that tissue-scale spatial structure can have a profound impact on the resilience of tumours to immunotherapy using a classical model incorporating IL-2 compounds and effector cells as treatment parameters. Using linear stability analysis, numerical continuation, and direct simulations, we show that diffusing cancer cell populations can undergo pattern-forming (Turing) instabilities, leading to spatially-structured states that persist far into treatment regimes where the corresponding spatially homogeneous systems would uniformly predict a cancer-free state. These spatially-patterned states persist in a wide range of parameters, as well as under time-dependent treatment regimes. Incorporating treatment via domain boundaries can increase this resistance to treatment in the interior of the domain, further highlighting the importance of spatial modelling when designing treatment protocols informed by mathematical models. Counter-intuitively, this mechanism shows that increased effector cell mobility can increase the resilience of tumours to treatment. We conclude by discussing practical and theoretical considerations for understanding this kind of spatial resilience in other models of cancer treatment, in particular those incorporating more realistic spatial transport."

However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types. We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation. Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies.

Specially, we find the fractal structure in the plot of Vout versus epsilon, which is not reported previously. We computes the Box_counting dimension for these fractal structures.

This is achieved by solving the synchronization equations on the raw, homeostatic weighted and a random inhibitory edge variant of a real full fly (FF) connectome, containing $\simeq 10^5$ neuron cell nodes. We investigate these systems close to their synchronization transition critical points. While the topological(graph) dimension is high: $d \simeq 6$ the spectral dimensions of the variants, relevant in describing the synchronization behavior, are lower than the upper critical dimension: $d_s \simeq 2 < d_c=4$, suggesting relevant fluctuation effects and non mean-field scaling behavior. By measuring the auto-correlations and the auto-response functions for small perturbations we calculate the fluctuation-dissipation ratios (FDR) for the different variants of different anisotropy levels of the FF connectome. Numerical evidence is presented that the FDRs follow the level of anisotropy of these non-equilibrium systems in agreement with the expectations. We also compare these results with those on a symmetric random graph of similar size. We provide a detailed network analysis of the FF connectome and calculate the level of hierarchy, also related to the anisotropy. Finally, we provide some partial results for the periodic forced Kuramoto, the Shinomoto-Kuramoto model."
2503.20651,Evolution of robust cell differentiation under epigenetic feedback,"['physics.bio-ph', 'nlin.AO']","['Davey Plugers', 'Kunihiko Kaneko']","In multi-cellular organisms, cells differentiate into multiple types as they divide. States of these cell types, as well as their numbers, are known to be robust to external perturbations; as conceptualized by Waddington's epigenetic landscape where cells embed themselves in valleys corresponding to final cell types. How is such robustness achieved by developmental dynamics and evolution? To address this question, we consider a model of cells with gene expression dynamics and epigenetic feedback, governed by a gene regulation network. By evolving the network to achieve more cell types, we identified three major differentiation processes exhibiting different properties regarding their variance, attractors, stability, and robustness. The first of these, type A, exhibits chaos and long-lived oscillatory dynamics that slowly transition until reaching a steady state. The second, type B, follows a channeled annealing process where the epigenetic changes in combination with noise shift the cells towards varying final cell states that increase the stability. Lastly, type C exhibits a quenching process where cell fate is quickly decided by falling into pre-existing fixed points while cell trajectories are separated through periodic attractors or saddle points. We find types A and B to correspond well with Waddington's landscape while being robust. Finally, the dynamics of type B demonstrate a differentiation process that uses a directed shifting of fixed points, visualized through the dimensional reduction of gene-expression states. Correspondence with the experimental data of gene expression variance through differentiation is also discussed."
2503.20632,Mathematical Models for Self-Adaptive Response to Cancer Dynamics,['nlin.AO'],['Christian Kuehn'],"We consider two minimal mathematical models for cancer dynamics and self-adaptation. We aim to capture the interplay between the rapid progression of cancer growth and the possibility to leverage and enhance self-adaptive defense mechanisms of an organism, e.g., motivated by immunotherapy. Yet, our two models are more abstract and generic encapsulating the essence of competition between rapid cancer growth and the speed of adaptation. First, we propose a four-dimensional ordinary differential equation model on a macroscopic level. The model has three main parameter regimes and its most important features can be studied analytically. At small external stimulation of adaptation, cancer progresses to a deadly level. At intermediate external input, a bifurcation is observed leaving behind only a locally stable cancer-free steady state. Unfortunately, in a large parameter regime after the bifurcation, a transient cancer density spike is observed. Only for a combination of external input and speeding up adaptation, cancer does not reach critical levels. To study the adaptation speed-up in the initial dynamics phase, we switch to a microscopic probabilistic model, which we study numerically. The microscopic model undergoes a sharp transition under variation of the self-adaptation probability. It is shown that a combination of temporal memory and rare stochastic positive adaptation events is crucial to move the sharp transition point to a desired regime. Despite their extreme simplicity, the two models already provide remarkably deep insight into the challenges one has to overcome to leverage/enhance the self-adaptation of an organism in fighting cancer."

They constitute the societal metabolism that literally produces everything for everybody by coordinating practically every single person on the planet. SCNs are by no means static but undergo permanent change through the entry and exit of firms and the re-arrangement of supply relations. Here we use a unique dataset to explore the temporal evolution of firms and their supplier-buyer relations of a national SCN. Monthly reported value added tax data from Hungary from 2014 to 2022 allows us to reconstruct the entire economy with 711,248 companies and 38,644,400 connections, covering practically every re-structuring event of an entire economy at firm-level resolution. We find that per year about 25\% of firms exit the SCN while 28\% new ones enter. On average, 55\% of all supply-links present in one year will not be present in the next. We report the half-life time of supply-links to be 13 months. New links attach super-preferentially to firms with a probability, $p(i)\propto k_i^{1.08}$, with $k_i$ firm $i$'s number of supply-connections. We calibrate a simple statistical network generation model that reproduces the stylized characteristics of the dominant Hungarian SCN. The model not only reproduces local network features such as in- and out-degree distributions, assortativity and clustering structure, but also captures realistic systemic risk profiles. We discuss the present model in how rewiring dynamics of the economy is essential for quantifying its resilience and to estimate shock propagation."

Our results reveal that while repeated cycles of elongation and retraction can facilitate growth enhancement, a network need to have a structure that mitigates material dissipation. This finding suggests that additional regulatory mechanisms are necessary for networks to efficiently redistribute resources following structural retraction."

Kozitsky', 'K. Pilorz', 'Yu. Holovatch']","The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geqslant 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions, the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right-hand and left-hand half-lines. As shown by [Chakraborti S., Dhar A., Krapivsky P., SciPost Phys., 2022, 13, 074], an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geqslant 0$ and the splash region in $x<0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values."
2503.20224,Transport Efficiency for Networks Obtained by Vertex Merging Operation,['nlin.CD'],"['Zhenhua Yuan', 'Junhao Peng', 'Long Gao']","Transport is an important function of networks. Studying transport efficiency sheds light on the dynamic processes occurring within various underlying structures and offers a wide range of applications. To construct networks with different transport efficiencies, we focus on the networks obtained by vertex merging operation, which involves connecting multiple graphs through a single node. In this paper, we examine unbiased random walks on these networks and analyze their first-passage properties, including the mean first-passage time (MFPT), the mean trapping time (MTT), and the global-mean first-passage time (GFPT), which characterizes the transport (search) efficiency within the networks. We rigorously derive close-form solutions for these quantities. Results show that all these quantities are governed by the first-passage properties of the constituent components. Additionally, we propose a general method for optimizing the transport (search) efficiency by selecting a suitable node and adjusting the growth of the number of nodes in the subgraphs. We validate our findings using lollipop and barbell graphs. Our results indicate that for an arbitrary GFPT scaling exponent $α\in [1, 3]$, we can construct a network with GFPT scales with the network size $N$ as $\text{GFPT} \sim N^α$ through vertex merging operation. These conclusions provide valuable insights for designing and optimizing network structures."

We present a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, integrating data from seven distinct states experienced by participants undergoing general anesthesia, and resting-state recordings from individuals with inattentive-type ADHD alongside healthy control groups. Departing from prior studies that primarily focus on EEG amplitude dynamics, we adopt a novel relative phase approach to extract patterns of information flow directionality based on EEG phase dynamics. We quantify the complexity of these relative phase directionality patterns across various states using permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity measure within ordinal pattern framework. Our analysis: (i) PE is inversely correlated with the level of consciousness during general anesthesia, reflecting a dynamic interplay between anesthetic depth and shifts in directional information flow; (ii) healthy subjects consistently show higher PE than inADHD participants; (iii) when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition or individual differences, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics; and (iv) brain data consistently exhibit higher complexity than standard stochastic processes, likely due to greater multifractal scaling. These findings highlight that neural information propagation, as captured by EEG relative phase dynamics, is governed by self-organizing principles that are fundamentally more complex than the stochastic processes. Our EEG relative phase-based characterization provides new insight into the complexity of neural information flow directionality."

This defines a Markov process on the set of stabilised patterns, with unboundedly growing or overly large patterns represented by a general unspecified state of ""being huge"". This stochastic model should approximate emergence of complexity and live processes yet more interestingly than the original Conway's game. This paper illustrates the proposed Markovian dynamics on the infinite ""Life"" grid with a limited set of most frequent patterns.

Short-term pulsatile dynamics of compliant vessels affects the long-term structures of adapting networks; however, what the correct adaptation rule is for pulsatile flows still remains an open question. Here we propose a new adaptation rule for periodically driven complex elastic networks that accounts for the effect of short-term pulsatile dynamics on the remodeling signal at long time-scales. Using this rule to adapt hierarchical elastic networks with multiple levels of looping, we show that very different network architectures are possible at steady-state depending on the driving frequency of the pulsatile source and the geometric asymmetry of the paths between the externally driven nodes of the network. Specifically resonant frequencies are shown to prioritize the stabilization of fully looped structures or higher level loops proximal to the source, whereas anti-resonant frequencies predominantly stabilize loop-less structures or lower-level loops distal to the source. Thus, this model offers a mechanism that can explain the stabilization of phenotypically diverse loopy network architectures in response to source pulsatility under physiologically relevant conditions and in the absence of other known loop stabilization mechanisms, such as random fluctuations in the load or perfusion homogenization."

Here, we ask how morphogenetic reproducibility is realised by developing a computational model that evolves complex morphologies. We find that evolved, complex morphologies are reproducible in a sizeable fraction of simulations, despite no direct selection for reproducibility. Strikingly, reproducible morphologies had also evolved stem-cell systems. We show that reproducibility is caused by a morphogenetic division of labour based on these stem-cell systems, where moving, dividing stem cells ``shape'' morphologies and irreversibly differentiate into stationary, non-dividing cells. These results suggest that stem-cell systems observed in natural development play fundamental roles in morphogenesis in addition to their known role of producing specialised cell types. This previously-unrecognised role of stem-cell systems has major implications for our understanding of how morphologies are generated and regenerated."

The eigenfunctions belonging to the zero eigenvalue of the Liouvillian correspond to the invariants of the motion. The zero eigenvalue of the integrable unperturbed Liouvillian is infinitely degenerate at the resonance point. By applying a perturbation, level repulsion occurs between the eigenstates of the unperturbed system, and some of the degeneracy is lifted, resulting in a non-zero eigenvalue. In order to evaluate the frequency gap caused by the level repulsion, we introduce an auxiliary operator called the collision operator which is well known in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We show that the dependence of the magnitude of frequency gap on the coupling constant can be quantitatively evaluated by simply finding the condition for the existence of the collision operator, without directly solving the eigenvalue problem."

By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of ""surprising"" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery."

While many parameter estimation techniques rely on time-series data, particularly systems that converge over extreme time ranges, only noisy steady-state data is available, requiring a new approach to infer dynamical parameters from noisy observations of steady states. However, the traditional optimization process is computationally demanding, requiring repeated simulation of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a surrogate objective function that leverages decoupled equations to compute steady states, significantly reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, by optimizing the surrogate objective function, we obtain steady states that more accurately approximate the ground truth than noisy observations and predict future equilibria when topology changes. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across ecological, gene regulatory, and epidemic networks. Our approach provides an efficient and effective way to estimate parameters from steady-state data and has the potential to improve predictions in networked dynamical systems."

We prove that nonlinearly coupled heterogeneous oscillators located on a group of topologically equivalent nodes can get easily synchronized when the group forms a fully connected subgraph (or combinations thereof), regardless of the status of all the other oscillators. More generally, any change occurring in the remainder of the graph will not alter the synchronization status of the group. Typically, the group can synchronize when $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}\leq k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$, $k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$ and $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}$ being the common internal and outgoing degree of each node in the group, respectively. Simulations confirm our rigorous analysis and suggest that groups of topologically equivalent nodes act as independent pacemakers."
2503.18124,On the Topological Nature of the Butterfly Effect,"['hep-th', 'math-ph', 'nlin.CD']",['Igor V. Ovchinnikov'],"Non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, also known as dynamical chaos, is a strongly nonlinear qualitative phenomenon. Its most promising theoretical descriptions are likely to emerge from non-perturbative approaches, with symmetry-based methods being particularly reliable. One such symmetry-based framework is supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS). STS reformulates a general form stochastic (partial) differential equations (SDE) as a cohomological topological field theory (TFT) and identifies the order associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the corresponding topological supersymmetry (TS) as the stochastic generalization of chaos. The Faddeev-Popov ghosts of STS act as a systematic bookkeeping tool for the dynamic differentials from the definition of the butterfly effect (BE): the infinitely long dynamical memory unique to chaos. Accordingly, the effective field theory (EFT) of the TS breaking is essentially a field theory of the BE in the long-wavelength limit. Building on this perspective, here we demonstrate that one way to build such EFTs is the background field method with the external $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ supergauge field coupled to N=2 supercurrents of STS, the fermion number conservation, and translations in time. By the Goldstone theorem, the resulting EFTs are conformal field theories (CFTs) and the operator product expansion provides an explanation for 1/f noise -- the experimental signature of chaos in the form of dynamical power-law correlations. Moreover, the generating functional of the background field possesses its own TS, revealing the topological nature of the BE. Particularly, when the Anti-de Sitter(AdS)/CFT correspondence is an acceptable approximation, the holographic dual of EFT is a cohomological TFT on AdS in which the associated TS and the isometry of the basespace underlie the BE and 1/f noise, respectively."

Our approach, which we call KGMM, offers a systematic way to combine statistical density estimation with a neural-network-based interpolation of the score, leveraging the strengths of both. We demonstrate its ability to accurately reconstruct the long-time statistical properties of several paradigmatic systems, including lower-dimensional potential systems and chaotic Lorenz-type models. Numerical experiments show that KGMM yields robust estimates of the score function, even for small values of the covariance amplitude in the GMM, where the standard GMM methods tend to fail because of noise amplification. These accurate estimates allow us to build effective stochastic reduced-order models that reproduce the invariant measures of the target dynamics."

A common form of regularization in the ML literature is to train on data where similar inputs map to different outputs. This improves generalization by preventing ML models from becoming overconfident in their predictions. This paper shows how using longer timesteps when modelling chaotic Earth systems naturally leads to more of this regularization. We show this in two domains. We explain how using longer model timesteps can improve results and demonstrate that increased regularization is one of the causes. We explain why longer model timesteps lead to improved regularization in these systems and present a procedure to pick the model timestep. We also carry out a benchmarking exercise on ORAS5 ocean reanalysis data to show that a longer model timestep (28 days) than is typically used gives realistic simulations. We suggest that there will be many opportunities to use this type of regularization in Earth system problems because the Earth system is chaotic and the regularization is so easy to implement.

Although neighborhoods are not unique, every CA admits a unique minimal neighborhood, which consists on all the essential cells in $G$ that affect the behavior of the local map. An active transition of a cellular automaton is a pattern that produces a change on the current state of a cell when the local map is applied. In this paper, we study the links between the minimal neighborhood and the number of active transitions, known as the activity value, of cellular automata. Our main results state that the activity value usually imposes several restrictions on the size of the minimal neighborhood of local maps."

These solutions are analyzed in the weakly nonlinear regime. The theory is based on Whitham's averaged variational principle. The problem is reduced to a fully separated two degrees of freedom dynamical problem. This separation allows for simple derivation of the autoresonant thresholds on the driving wave amplitudes. We also excite more complex 4-phase autoresonant waves. The inverse scattering analysis of this case indicates again the separation of all four degrees of freedom in the associated weakly nonlinear dynamical problem."

For example, brain activity, which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures, a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths, to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explored the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure."

Ewart', 'James Juno', 'Michael Barnes', 'Alexander A. Schekochihin']","The thermal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field arising due to particle noise in a quiescent Vlasov-Poisson plasma was derived in the 1960s. Here, we derive the universal fluctuation spectrum of the electric field, at Debye and sub-Debye scales, for a turbulent Vlasov-Poisson plasma. This spectrum arises from what is likely to be the final cascade - a universal regime to be encountered at the extreme small-scale end of any turbulent cascade in a nearly collisionless plasma. The cascaded invariant is $C_2$, the quadratic Casimir invariant of the particle distribution function. $C_2$ cascades to small scales in position and velocity space via linear and nonlinear phase mixing, in such a way that the time scales of the two processes are critically balanced at every scale. We construct a scaling theory of the fluctuation spectrum of $C_2$ and of the electric field in wavenumber space. The electric-field spectrum is sufficiently steep for the nonlinear mixing to be controlled by the largest-scale electric fields, and so the $C_2$ cascade resembles the Batchelor cascade of a passive scalar. Our theory is supported by simulations of a forced 1D-1V plasma. We predict that the cascade is terminated at the wavenumber where the turbulent electric-field spectrum gives way to the thermal noise spectrum. The time scale for this small-scale cutoff to be reached is the dynamical time of phase-space mixing times a logarithmic factor in the plasma parameter - this is the first concrete demonstration of this property of Vlasov-Poisson turbulence, akin to how fluid turbulence dissipates energy at a rate independent (or nearly independent) of molecular diffusion. In the presence of the sub-Debye phase-space cascade - a scenario that may be ubiquitous - standard collisional plasma theory ceases to be valid. This calls for the development of new collision operators suited to such turbulent environments."

We systematically explore the interplay between magnetic and kinetic chaos in toroidal fusion plasmas, where non-axisymmetric perturbations disrupt smooth magnetic flux surfaces, generating complex particle trajectories. Using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method, we efficiently quantify chaos, compare the behavior of magnetic field lines and particle orbits, visualize the radial distribution of chaotic regions, and offer GALI as a valuable tool for studying plasma physics dynamics. We also study the evolution of phase space structures in a 3D barred galactic potential, following successive 2D and 3D pitchfork and period-doubling bifurcations of periodic orbits. By employing the `color and rotation' technique to visualize the system's 4D Poincaré surface of sections, we reveal distinct structural patterns. We further investigate the long-term diffusion transport and chaos properties of single and coupled standard maps, focusing on parameters inducing anomalous diffusion through accelerator modes exhibiting ballistic transport. Using different ensembles of initial conditions in chaotic regions influenced by these modes, we examine asymptotic diffusion rates and time scales, identifying conditions suppressing anomalous transport and leading to long-term convergence to normal diffusion across coupled maps. Lastly, we perform the first comprehensive investigation into the GALI indices for various attractors in continuous and discrete-time dissipative systems, extending the method's application to non-Hamiltonian systems. A key aspect of our work involves analyzing and comparing GALIs' with Lyapunov Exponents for systems exhibiting hyperchaotic motion."

Ovchinnikov'],"A close relation has recently emerged between two of the most fundamental concepts in physics and mathematics: chaos and supersymmetry. In striking contrast to the semantics of the word 'chaos,' the true physical essence of this phenomenon now appears to be a spontaneous order associated with the breakdown of the topological supersymmetry (TS) hidden in all stochastic (partial) differential equations, i.e., in all systems from a broad domain ranging from cosmology to nanoscience. Among the low-hanging fruits of this new perspective, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), are theoretical explanations of 1/f noise and self-organized criticality. Central to STS is the physical meaning of TS breaking order parameter (OP). In this paper, we discuss that the OP is a field-theoretic embodiment of the 'butterfly effect' (BE) -- the infinitely long dynamical memory that is definitive of chaos. We stress that the formulation of the corresponding effective theory for the OP would mark the inception of the first consistent physical theory of the BE. Such a theory, potentially a valuable tool in solving chaos-related problems, would parallel the well-established and successful field theoretic descriptions of superconductivity, ferromagentism and other known orders arising from the spontaneous breakdown of various symmetries of nature."

While evolution of light in the bulk of photonic quasicrystals is well studied, experimental evidences of light localization near the edge of truncated photonic quasicrystal structures are practically absent. In this Letter, we observe both linear and nonlinear localization of light at the edges of radially cropped quasicrystal waveguide arrays, forming an aperiodic Penrose tiling. Our theoretical analysis reveals that for certain truncation radii, the system exhibits linear eigenstates localized at the edge of the truncated array, whereas for other radii, this localization does not occur, highlighting the significant influence of truncation on edge light localization. Using single-waveguide excitations, we experimentally confirm the presence of localized states in Penrose arrays inscribed by a femtosecond laser and investigate the effects of nonlinearity on these states. Our theoretical findings identify a family of edge solitons, and experimentally, we observe a transition from linear localized states to edge solitons as the power of the input pulse increases.

While much of the existing literature focuses on the properties of equilibrium fixed points, persistent dynamics (e.g., limit cycles or chaos) have also been observed, both in natural or lab-controlled ecosystems and in mathematical models. Here we emphasize the emergence of limit cycles following Hopf bifurcations tuned by the variability of interspecies interaction. As this variability increases, and owing to the large dimensionality of the system, limit cycles typically acquire a growing spectrum of frequencies. This often leads to the appearance of strange attractors, with a chaotic dynamics of species abundances characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent. We observe that limit cycles and strange attractors preserve biodiversity to some extent, as they maintain dynamical stability without species extinction. We give numerical evidences that this route to chaos dominates in ecosystems with strong enough interactions and where predator-prey behavior dominates over competition and mutualism. Based on arguments from random matrix theory, we further conjecture that this scenario is generic in ecosystems with large number of species, and identify the key parameters driving it. Overall, we show that the model we consider provides a unifying framework, where a wide range of population dynamics emerge from a simple few-parameter model."

The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology.

In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states.

The classical escape rate of such a system can be computed with classical trajectory Monte Carlo techniques, but these computations require enormous numbers of trajectories, provide little understanding of the dynamical mechanisms involved, and must be completely rerun for any change of system parameter, no matter how small. We demonstrate an alternative technique to classical trajectory Monte Carlo computations, based on classical periodic orbit theory. In this technique, escape rates are computed from a relatively modest number (a few thousand) of periodic orbits of the system. One only needs the orbits' periods and stability eigenvalues. A major advantage of this approach is that one does not need to repeat the entire analysis from scratch as system parameters are varied; one can numerically continue the periodic orbits instead. We demonstrate the periodic orbit technique for the ionization of a hydrogen atom in applied parallel electric and magnetic fields. Using fundamental theories of phase space geometry, we also show how to generate nontrivial symbolic dynamics for acquiring periodic orbits in physical systems.

In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $π$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $π$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism."

We also show that for both cascades a scale separation of over an order of magnitude is necessary to ensure a negligible interaction rate with forcing or dissipation regions, hinting at why in numerical simulations of the model an extremely large box size is necessary in order to realize the theoretical Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra."

Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N>2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators."
2503.15086,Cellular Automata on Probability Measures,"['nlin.CG', 'cs.IT']","['Enrico Formenti', 'Faizal Hafiz', 'Amelia Kunze', 'Davide La Torre']","Classical Cellular Automata (CCAs) are a powerful computational framework widely used to model complex systems driven by local interactions. Their simplicity lies in the use of a finite set of states and a uniform local rule, yet this simplicity leads to rich and diverse dynamical behaviors. CCAs have found applications in numerous scientific fields, including quantum computing, biology, social sciences, and cryptography. However, traditional CCAs assume complete certainty in the state of all cells, which limits their ability to model systems with inherent uncertainty. This paper introduces a novel generalization of CCAs, termed Cellular Automata on Measures (CAMs), which extends the classical framework to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty. In this setting, the state of each cell is described by a probability measure, and the local rule operates on configurations of such measures. This generalization encompasses the traditional Bernoulli measure framework of CCAs and enables the study of more complex systems, including those with spatially varying probabilities. We provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for CAMs, demonstrate their applicability through concrete examples, and explore their potential to model the dynamics of random graphs. Additionally, we establish connections between CAMs and symbolic dynamics, presenting new avenues for research in random graph theory. This study lays the groundwork for future exploration of CAMs, offering a flexible and robust framework for modeling uncertainty in cellular automata and opening new directions for both theoretical analysis and practical applications."

Compared to the standing periodic wave of the defocusing NLS (nonlinear Schrödinger) equation, these solutions are special cases of Riemann's theta function of genus two. Based on our characterization, we derive a new two-parameter solution form which defines a general three-parameter solution form with the scaling transformation. Eigenfunctions of the Lax system for the general traveling periodic wave are also characterized as quotients of products of Jacobi's theta functions. As the main outcome of our analytical computations, we derive a new solution of the defocusing mKdV equation which describes the kink breather propagating on a general traveling wave background."

We study the linear and nonlinear stability of the peaked traveling wave by using a local model for shallow water waves, which is related to the Hunter--Saxton equation. The evolution problem is well-defined in the function space $H^1_{\rm per} \cap W^{1,\infty}$, where we derive the linearized equations of motion and study the nonlinear evolution of co-periodic perturbations to the peaked periodic wave by using methods of characteristics. Within the linearized equations, we prove the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave from the spectrum of the linearized operator in a Hilbert space, which completely covers the closed vertical strip with a specific half-width. Within the nonlinear equations, we prove the nonlinear instability of the peaked traveling wave by showing that the gradient of perturbations grow at the wave peak. By using numerical approximations of the smooth traveling waves and the spectrum of their associated linearized operator, we show that the spectral instability of the peaked traveling wave cannot be obtained in the limit along the family of the spectrally stable smooth traveling waves."

These solitons are formed by the superposition of dark and bright ones, and exhibit a beating state over time and a striped state across space, earning them the designation of beating stripe solitons. Our analysis demonstrates that helicoidal SOC significantly affects the formation and dynamical properties of these solitons, also serving as the primary driver for spin oscillations. Through the nonlinear superposition of the beating stripe solitons, a range of intricate scenarios of the interaction between multiple solitons emerges, including head-on collisions, bound states, and parallel states."

However, the unpredictability of chaotic systems is a textbook concept due to their sensitivity to initial conditions, aperiodic behavior, fractal dimensions, nonlinearity, and strange attractors. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, chaotic learning, a novel multiscale topological paradigm that enables accurate predictions from chaotic systems. We show that seemingly random and unpredictable chaotic dynamics counterintuitively offer unprecedented quantitative predictions. Specifically, we devise multiscale topological Laplacians to embed real-world data into a family of interactive chaotic dynamical systems, modulate their dynamical behaviors, and enable the accurate prediction of the input data. As a proof of concept, we consider 28 datasets from four categories of realistic problems: 10 brain waves, four benchmark protein datasets, 13 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, and an image dataset, as well as two distinct chaotic dynamical systems, namely the Lorenz and Rossler attractors. We demonstrate chaotic learning predictions of the physical properties from chaos. Our new chaotic learning paradigm profoundly changes the textbook perception of chaos and bridges topology, chaos, and learning for the first time."

In these systems the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) grows in time faster than linearly. We show that irrespective of the geometry of these channels, the distribution of the first return times decays algebraically with two different exponents, separated by a crossover region that is determined by the MSD. We find that the distribution of first return times satisfies a simple scaling form. In turn, the transmission coefficient, defined as the fraction of trajectories that starting at the cell at the origin escape the channel through the other boundary, decays algebraically with the size of the system, and, as a signature of non-recurrent transport, sometimes slower. From these two processes we derive a locking relation among the scaling exponents for the asymptotic behavior of the MSD, the times of first return to the origin and the way transmission decays with the system size, showing that these three processes are interdependent. The locking relation holds for diffusive processes, as well as for fractional Brownian motion with arbitrary Hurst exponent. We argue that the locking relation may be valid for many other transport processes, Markovian or not, with finite MSD."
2503.14702,Learning Chaos In A Linear Way,['nlin.CD'],"['Xiaoyuan Cheng', 'Yi He', 'Yiming Yang', 'Xiao Xue', 'Sibo Cheng', 'Daniel Giles', 'Xiaohang Tang', 'Yukun Hu']","Learning long-term behaviors in chaotic dynamical systems, such as turbulent flows and climate modelling, is challenging due to their inherent instability and unpredictability. These systems exhibit positive Lyapunov exponents, which significantly hinder accurate long-term forecasting. As a result, understanding long-term statistical behavior is far more valuable than focusing on short-term accuracy. While autoregressive deep sequence models have been applied to capture long-term behavior, they often lead to exponentially increasing errors in learned dynamics. To address this, we shift the focus from simple prediction errors to preserving an invariant measure in dissipative chaotic systems. These systems have attractors, where trajectories settle, and the invariant measure is the probability distribution on attractors that remains unchanged under dynamics. Existing methods generate long trajectories of dissipative chaotic systems by aligning invariant measures, but it is not always possible to obtain invariant measures for arbitrary datasets. We propose the Poincare Flow Neural Network (PFNN), a novel operator learning framework designed to capture behaviors of chaotic systems without any explicit knowledge of the invariant measure. PFNN employs an auto-encoder to map the chaotic system to a finite-dimensional feature space, effectively linearizing the chaotic evolution. It then learns the linear evolution operators to match the physical dynamics by addressing two critical properties in dissipative chaotic systems: (1) contraction, the system's convergence toward its attractors, and (2) measure invariance, trajectories on the attractors following a probability distribution invariant to the dynamics. Our experiments on a variety of chaotic systems demonstrate that PFNN has more accurate predictions and physical statistics compared to competitive baselines."

We further explicitly show how each iteration of this discrete Painlevé I equation corresponds to a certain composition of Bäcklund transformations for Painlevé V, as was first remarked in work by Tokihiro, Grammaticos and Ramani. In addition, we show that some explicit special function solutions of Painlevé V, written in terms of modified Bessel functions, yield the unique positive solution of the initial value problem required for quantum minimal surfaces."

A nonlinear delay differential equation (DDE) model, predicated upon an activator-inhibitor framework, is formulated to represent the interspecies interactions. Key analytical techniques, including the derivation of the pseudo-characteristic polynomial and the determination of Hopf bifurcation criteria, are employed to investigate the stability properties of steady-state solutions. The analysis reveals the critical role of multiple, dissimilar delays in modulating system dynamics and inducing bifurcations. Numerical simulations, conducted in conjunction with analytical results, reveal the emergence of periodic self-sustained oscillations and intermittent chaotic behaviour. These observations emphasise the intricate relationship between temporal heterogeneity and the stability landscape of systems exhibiting QS-inspired dynamics. This interplay highlights the capacity for temporal variations to induce complex dynamical transitions within such systems. These findings assist to the comprehension of temporal dynamics within these and related systems, and may contribute to the development of strategies aimed at modulating intercellular communication and engineering synthetic biological systems with temporal control."

A qualitative understanding of cholera epidemics aims to foresee transmission patterns based on reported data and mechanistic models. The mechanistic model is a crucial tool for capturing the dynamics of disease transmission and population spread. However, using real-time cholera cases is essential for forecasting the transmission trend. This prospective study seeks to furnish insights into transmission trends through qualitative dynamics followed by machine learning-based forecasting. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is employed to calibrate the proposed mechanistic model. We identify critical parameters that illustrate the disease's dynamics using partial rank correlation coefficient-based sensitivity analysis. The basic reproduction number as a crucial threshold measures asymptotic dynamics. Furthermore, forward bifurcation directs the stability of the infection state, and Hopf bifurcation suggests that trends in transmission may become unpredictable as societal disinfection rates rise. Further, we develop epidemic-informed machine learning models by incorporating mechanistic cholera dynamics into autoregressive integrated moving averages and autoregressive neural networks. We forecast short-term future cholera cases in Malawi by implementing the proposed epidemic-informed machine learning models to support this. We assert that integrating temporal dynamics into the machine learning models can enhance the capabilities of cholera forecasting models. The execution of this mechanism can significantly influence future trends in cholera transmission. This evolving approach can also be beneficial for policymakers to interpret and respond to potential disease systems. Moreover, our methodology is replicable and adaptable, encouraging future research on disease dynamics."

Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible to miscible quenching transition (IMQT), under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex productions and sound-wave (phonon) propagations. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number $k$. The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$, for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals. Deviating from the classical scaling, a kind of ``Bottleneck effect"" is noticed in the IMQT spectra."

The separatrix map is set in natural variables; and the case of the layer's least perturbed border is considered, i.~e., the winding number of the layer's border (the last invariant curve) is the golden mean. Although these two dependences (for the Lyapunov exponent and the layer width) are strongly non-monotonous and evade any simple analytical description, the calculated dynamical entropy $h$ turns out to be a close-to-linear function of $λ$. In other words, if normalized by $λ$, the entropy is a quasi-constant. We discuss whether the function $h(λ)$ can be in fact exactly linear, $h \propto λ$. The function $h(λ)$ forms a basis for calculating the dynamical entropy for any perturbed nonlinear resonance in the first fundamental model, as soon as the corresponding Melnikov--Arnold integral is estimated."

Here, we study an ensemble of globally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators and focus on the question of how 3-cluster solutions emerge from 2-cluster solutions and how the different 3-cluster solutions are organized in parameter space. We show that the arrangement of the clusters is dictated by a co-dimension 2 point, which we coin Type-II cluster singularity.

Remarkably, the results from complex spectra and singular value analysis are seemingly different, thereby necessitating caution while identifying different phases. We also exemplify our findings by studying a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a complex on-site disorder.

In our previous works, we found that, in 2D, both models predict the existence of two distinct regimes: (i) a low-solvent regime, characterized by two interpenetrated domains of the two polymers, and (ii) a high-solvent regime, where isolated polymer domains are dispersed in the solvent background. In the significantly more intriguing 3D case, we observe a comparable scenario both for the discrete and the continuous model.

Recently, there has been an increased interest in understanding the impact of higher-order interactions on the population dynamics of coupled oscillators. Meanwhile, estimating a mathematical model from experimental data is a vital step in understanding the dynamics of real-world complex systems. In coupled oscillator systems, identifying the type of interaction (e.g. pairwise or three-body) of a network is challenging, because different interactions can induce similar dynamical states and bifurcations. In this study, we have developed a method based on the adaptive LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) to infer the interactions between the oscillators from time series data. The proposed method can successfully classify the type of interaction and infer the probabilities of the existence of pairwise and three-body couplings. Through systematic analysis of synthetic datasets, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms two baseline methods, LASSO and OLS (Ordinary Least Squares), in accurately inferring the topology and strength of couplings between oscillators. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to the synthetic data of 100 oscillators.

The IDM system, which in the continuous limit reduces to the Manakov system (i.e., a 2-component vector nonlinear Schrodinger equation), was shown to admit a variety of discrete vector soliton solutions: fundamental solitons, fundamental breathers, and composite breathers. While the interaction of fundamental solitons was studied early on, no results are presently available for other types of soliton-breather and breather-breather interactions. Our study reveals that upon interacting with a fundamental breather, a fundamental soliton becomes a fundamental breather. Conversely, the interaction of two fundamental breathers generically yields two fundamental breathers with polarization shifts, but may also result in a fundamental soliton and a fundamental breather. Composite breathers interact trivially both with each other and with a fundamental soliton or breather. Explicit formulas for the scattering coefficients that characterize fundamental and composite breathers are given. This allows us to interpret the interactions in terms of a refactorization problem and derive the associated Yang-Baxter maps describing the effect of interactions on the polarizations. These give the first examples of parametric Yang-Baxter maps of trigonometric type."

We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as $\exp[-α(\ln δ)^2]$, where $δ$ is the distance from the critical point, while $α$ is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state."

Specifically, weak gain leads to the emergence of a nearly monochromatic SG, while weak damping results in a SG with a semicircular spectral distribution at long propagation distances. These observed dissipation-driven changes in the SG's spectral characteristics are not explained by existing hydrodynamic or kinetic theories."

However, performing a recognition task of time-dependent signal by such an MTJ-based ASI has not been reported yet. In this work, we examine numerical simulation of a recognition task of time-dependent input and evaluate short-term memory and parity-check capacities. These capacities change significantly when the magnitude of the input magnetic field is comparable to a value around which the magnetization alignment is greatly affected by the dipole interaction. It implies that the presence of the dipole interaction results in a loss of echo state property. This point was clarified by evaluating Lyapunov exponent and confirming that the drastic change of the memory capacities appears near the boundary between negative and zero exponents, which corresponds to the edge of echo state property."

This replaces empirical scaling laws with an infinite set of power terms with calculable decay exponents, some of which appear as complex-conjugate pairs related to the Riemann zeta function. A key result of our analysis is the explicit dependence of the solution on the Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pr} = ν/η$), leading to a phase transition at $\mathrm{Pr} = 1$. In the $\mathrm{Pr}<1$ regime, turbulence is dominated by hydrodynamic fluctuations, while for $\mathrm{Pr}>1$, two distinct solutions emerge: a metastable one in which magnetic fluctuations grow with $\mathrm{Pr}$ and a stable one where they remain balanced with hydrodynamic fluctuations. We compare our theoretical predictions with recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) and discuss their implications for astrophysical plasmas, fusion devices, and laboratory MHD experiments. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding MHD turbulence and its dependence on fundamental parameters, offering a new perspective on turbulence in highly conducting fluids."

The distribution is characterized by singularities, which predominantly take two forms: double-cusped triangular lines and lines parallel to the equipotential line that defines the accessible region. Over time, the number of these singular patterns increases linearly. Consequently, at very large times, the singular patterns fully occupy the accessible area, resulting in a steady state probability distribution with a pronounced singular peak at the center. Changes in the singular patterns arise solely from the system's intrinsic dynamics rather than variations in its parameters, emphasizing the system's self-organizing nature over time.

They have found widespread application in the modeling of the uniaxial orientational ordering of liquid crystals. However, only very limited progress has been made in applying them to the more complex cases of biaxial phases and biaxial particles. Here, we discuss the microscopic derivation of PFC models for biaxial liquid crystals. We illustrate it by presenting two models, one involving four scalar orientational order parameters relevant for the dynamics of biaxial particles, and one involving two scalar order parameters and a director field to describe biaxial phases in a three-dimensional uniaxial nematic liquid crystal. These models allow for an efficient simulation of spatially inhomogeneous biaxial orientational ordering dynamics. We also combine a microscopic and macroscopic approach to extract model coefficients for a full biaxial model from the microscopic derivation for a simple special case. This universal method also enables to perform derivations for other low-symmetry particles where, due to the complexity of the general case, this has not been previously attempted."
2503.11799,Effect of oblique horizontal magnetic field on convection rolls,"['physics.flu-dyn', 'nlin.CD', 'nlin.PS']","['Snehashish Sarkar', 'Sutapa Mandal', 'Pinaki Pal']","We investigate the effect of external horizontal magnetic field applied on the convection rolls obliquely (at an angle $φ$ with the $x$-axis) in electrically conducting low Prandtl number fluids under the paradigm of the Rayleigh-Bénard convection by performing three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. The control parameters, namely, the Chandrasekhar number ($\mathrm{Q}$) and the reduced Rayleigh number $r$ (ratio of Rayleigh number to critical Rayleigh number), are varied in the ranges $0 \leq \mathrm{Q} \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq r \leq 20$ for the Prandtl numbers $\mathrm{Pr} = 0.1$ and $0.2$ by considering three horizontal aspect ratios ($Γ$): $\frac{1}{2}$, $1$ and $2$. In the absence of the magnetic field, the convection starts in the form of steady rolls including the one parallel to the $x$-axis. As the oblique horizontal magnetic field is switched on at an angle $φ\in (0^\circ, ~90^\circ]$ with the $x$-axis, it is observed that the Lorentz force generated by the component of the magnetic field transverse to the axis of the convection rolls inhibits convection in the form of steady rolls. Thus, with the application of the magnetic field, the convection is suppressed and restarts for a higher Rayleigh number in the form of steady convection rolls. The rolls can either be oriented along the $x$-axis (steady parallel rolls, SPR) or oriented at an angle $45^\circ$ (steady oblique rolls, SOR$^+$) with the $x$-axis depending on the choices of the parameters. A rich bifurcation structure with standing and traveling patterns emerges at higher $r$. The oscillatory instability of steady rolls scales as \( \mathrm{Q}^α\) with distinct exponents for weak and strong magnetic fields. Additionally, heat transfer decreases with increasing \( φ\) for given \( \mathrm{Q} \) and \( \mathrm{Pr} \)."

This model can be thought of a dense collection of many ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons. We establish a law of large numbers for the trajectory of these quasiparticles, showing that they travel with approximately constant velocities, which are explicit. Our proof is based on a direct analysis of the asymptotic scattering relation, an equation (proven in previous work of the author) that approximately governs the dynamics of quasiparticles locations. This makes use of a regularization argument that essentially linearizes this relation, together with concentration estimates for the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix."

2503.11278,Path integral approach for predicting the diffusive statistics of geometric phases in chaotic Hamiltonian systems,['nlin.CD'],"['Ana Silva', 'Efi Efrati']","From the integer quantum Hall effect, to swimming at low Reynolds number, geometric phases arise in the description of many different physical systems. In many of these systems the temporal evolution prescribed by the geometric phase can be directly measured by an external observer. By definition, geometric phases rely on the history of the system's internal dynamics, and so their measurement is directly related to temporal correlations in the system. They, thus, provide a sensitive tool for studying chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In this work we present a toy model consisting of an autonomous, low-dimensional, chaotic Hamiltonian system designed to have a simple planar internal state space, and a single geometric phase. The diffusive phase dynamics in the highly chaotic regime is thus governed by the loop statistics of planar random walks. We show that the naïve loop statistics result in ballistic behavior of the phase, and recover the diffusive behavior by considering a bounded shape space, or a quadratic confining potential."

Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction."

Pabon', 'Marco Pavone', 'George Haller']","The mechanical complexity of soft robots creates significant challenges for their model-based control. Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot. Aided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control scheme purely from data. We demonstrate our data-driven model's effectiveness in tracking dynamic trajectories across diverse tasks, validated on a high-fidelity, high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot and a Cosserat rod-based elastic soft arm. Notably, we find that five- or six-dimensional aSSM-reduced models outperform the tracking performance of other data-driven modeling methods by a factor up to $10$ across all closed-loop control tasks."

We show that geometry of this kind naturally arises on solutions of various 4D dispersionless integrable hierarchies of heavenly type equations. In this context, rational normal scrolls coincide with the characteristic varieties (principal symbols) of the hierarchy. Furthermore, such structures automatically satisfy an additional property of involutivity. Our main result states that involutive scroll structures are themselves governed by a dispersionless integrable hierarchy, namely, the hierarchy of conformal self-duality equations."

Shepherd', 'S. Banu Ozkan', 'Steve Pressé']","State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories."

In certain cases, long-lived states of driven matter can emerge, which exhibit new material properties. In this work, we probe the excitation spectrum of an emergent patterned state in a driven superfluid, finding that its response is identical to that of a one-dimensional supersolid. In order to extract physical quantities that parametrize the observed sound modes, we apply an effective hydrodynamic theory of superfluid smectics, which is agnostic to microscopic processes. We therefore use the conceptual framework of supersolids to characterize an otherwise dynamic and far-from-equilibrium state."

However, this task is challenging, especially due to transient variability in systems with equivalent long-term dynamics. We address this by introducing smooth prototype equivalences (SPE), a framework that fits a diffeomorphism using normalizing flows to distinct prototypes - simplified dynamical systems that define equivalence classes of behavior. SPE enables classification by comparing the deformation loss of the observed sparse, high-dimensional measurements to the prototype dynamics. Furthermore, our approach enables estimation of the invariant sets of the observed dynamics through the learned mapping from prototype space to data space. Our method outperforms existing techniques in the classification of oscillatory systems and can efficiently identify invariant structures like limit cycles and fixed points in an equation-free manner, even when only a small, noisy subset of the phase space is observed. Finally, we show how our method can be used for the detection of biological processes like the cell cycle trajectory from high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data."

The striking analogies between photonic bound states and matter molecular structures in chemistry and physics have intensified studies on optical soliton molecules in both conservative and dissipative systems. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of vector soliton molecules and their related isomer structures in a conservative optical fiber system by considering the integrable Manakov equation. We show their existence by applying the velocity resonance condition and appropriate choice of temporal separations to the degenerate $N=(\bar{N}+\bar{M})$-soliton solution. Then, we classify the obtained molecular states as either dissociated or synthesized molecular states based on the temporal locations of the constituent solitons. Furthermore, we analyze the collision properties of vector soliton molecules in the present conservative system. The collision scenarios reveal that the soliton molecules undergo intriguing energy-sharing collisions through energy redistribution among the modes. To characterize these collisions, we have carried out an appropriate asymptotic analysis and found that elastic collisions arise as a special case of energy-sharing collisions under specific choices of polarization constants. Finally, we numerically verify the robustness of vector soliton molecules. We believe that the results presented in this paper show potential for soliton molecule-based applications such as optical computation and multi-level encoding for communications."

Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors."

The research explores two key mechanisms for achieving responsible governance, safe AI development and adoption of safe AI: incentivising effective regulation through media reporting, and conditioning user trust on commentariats' recommendation. The findings highlight the crucial role of the media in providing information to users, potentially acting as a form of ""soft"" regulation by investigating developers or regulators, as a substitute to institutional AI regulation (which is still absent in many regions).

To speed up the solving process of parameterized FPEs with several system parameters, we introduce a deep learning-based method to obtain the pseudo-analytical density (PAD). Unlike previous numerical methodologies that necessitate solving the FPE separately for each set of system parameters, the PAD simultaneously addresses all the FPEs within a predefined continuous range of system parameters during a single training phase. The approach utilizes a Gaussian mixture distribution (GMD) to represent the stationary probability density, the solution to the FPE. By leveraging a deep residual network, each system parameter configuration is mapped to the parameters of the GMD, ensuring that the weights, means, and variances of the Gaussian components adaptively align with the corresponding true density functions. A grid-free algorithm is further developed to effectively train the residual network, resulting in a feasible PAD obeying necessary normalization and boundary conditions. Extensive numerical studies validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, promising significant acceleration in the response analysis of multi-parameter, multi-dimensional stochastic nonlinear systems."

This is a consequence of the nontrivial boundedness of the energy for any positive time. We define a spatially forgetful \textit{oblivious fractional Brownian motion} (OFBM), with Hurst exponent $H$, and prove that Burgulence, with an OFBM as initial potential $\varphi_0(x)$, is not only intermittent, but it also displays, a hitherto unanticipated, large-scale bifractality or multifractality; the latter occurs if we combine OFBMs, with different values of $H$. This is the first rigorous proof of genuine multifractality for turbulence in a nonlinear hydrodynamical partial differential equation. We then present direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of freely decaying turbulence, capturing some aspects of this multifractality. For Burgulence, we investigate such decay for two cases: (A) $\varphi_0(x)$ a multifractal random walk that crosses over to a fractional Brownian motion beyond a crossover scale $\mathcal{L}$, tuned to go from small- to large-scale multifractality; (B) initial energy spectra $E_0(k)$, with wavenumber $k$, having one or more power-law regions, which lead, respectively, to self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay.

Riccobelli']","The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be destabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an elastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the cylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the result of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges spaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most models assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the solid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch.
  In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed by Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a mechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is sufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations reveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Period-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this research have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and microfabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role."

We also find an unexpected effect when varying the degree of inertia: the correlation time of the oscillators becomes minimal at an intermediate mass of the oscillators; correspondingly, the power spectra appear flatter and thus more similar to white noise around the same value of mass.

It is found that for a large range of time horizons and initial disturbance energies, the nonlinear optimal exhibits streak spacing and amplitude consistent with DNS at least at Re_tau = 180, which suggests that they isolate the relevant physical mechanisms that sustain turbulence. Moreover, the time horizon necessary for a nonlinear disturbance to outperform a linear optimal is consistent with previous DNS-based estimates using eddy turnover time, which offers a new perspective on how some turbulent time scales are determined."

As particular examples we Baxterize the $4\times 4$ constant non-invertible solutions of Hietarinta leading to nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians.

A strong chaotic fluctuation may be harmful to information processing. A traditional way to mitigate this issue is to introduce Hebbian plasticity, which can stabilize the dynamics. Here, we introduce another distinct way without synaptic plasticity. An Onsager reaction term due to the feedback of the neuron itself is added to the vanilla recurrent dynamics, making the driving force a gradient form. The original unstable fixed points supporting the chaotic fluctuation can then be approached by further decreasing the kinetic energy of the dynamics. We show that this freezing effect also holds in more biologically realistic networks, such as those composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The gradient dynamics are also useful for computational tasks such as recalling or predicting external time-dependent stimuli."

We justify the notion from the physics literature that this model can be thought of as a dense collection of ``quasiparticles'' that act as solitons by, (i) precisely defining the locations of these quasiparticles; (ii) showing that local charges and currents for the Toda lattice are well-approximated by simple functions of the quasiparticle data; and (iii) proving an asymptotic scattering relation that governs the dynamics of the quasiparticle locations. Our arguments are based on analyzing properties about eigenvector entries of the Toda lattice's (random) Lax matrix, particularly, their rates of exponential decay and their evolutions under inverse scattering."

Using hydrodynamics, we have recently shown how an $m$th-order external packing field coupled to density fluctuations in driven diffusive fluids can induce the spontaneous emergence of time-crystalline order in the form of $m$ rotating condensates, which can be further controlled and modulated. Here we analyze this phenomenon at the microscopic level in a paradigmatic model of particle diffusion under exclusion interactions, a generalization of the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process with a configuration-dependent field called the time-crystal lattice gas. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the nonequilibrium phase transition to these complex time-crystal phases for different values of $m$, including the order parameter, the susceptibility and the Binder cumulant, from which we measure the critical exponents, which turn out to be within the Kuramoto universality class for oscillator synchronization. We also elucidate the condensates density profiles and velocities, confirming along the way a scaling property predicted for the higher-order condensate shapes in terms of first-order ones, discussing also novel possibilities for this promising route to time crystals."
2503.07729,Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics,"['quant-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'hep-th', 'math-ph', 'nlin.CD']",['Amit Vikram'],"Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, by coarse-graining over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all states (in any orthonormal basis) over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single mixed state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities."

We assume that only the fast variable $x(t)$ resets to its initial state $x_0$ at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process of rate $r$. Fixing the slow variable, we determine the parameterized probability density $p(x,t|y)$, which is the solution to a modified Liouville equation. We then show how for $r\gg ε$ the slow dynamics can be approximated by the averaged equation $dy/dτ=\E[x|y]-y$ where $τ=εt$, $\E[x|y]=\int x p^*(x|y)dx$ and $p^*(x|y)=\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}p(x,t|y)$. We illustrate the theory for $f(x)$ given by the cubic function of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We find that the slow variable typically converges to an $r$-dependent fixed point $y^*$ that is a solution of the equation $y^*=\E[x|y^*]$. Finally, we numerically explore deviations from averaging theory when $r=O(ε)$."

Time series of water and matter fluxes and nutrient concentrations from these systems exhibit a bewildering diversity of spatio-temporal patterns, indicating the intricate nature of processes acting on a large range of time scales. Nonlinear dynamics is an obvious framework to investigate catchment time series. We analyze selected long-term data from three headwater catchments in the Bramke valley, Harz mountains, Lower Saxony in Germany at common biweekly resolution for the period 1991 to 2023. For every time series, we perform gap filling, detrending and removal of the annual cycle using Singular System Analysis (SSA), and then calculate metrics based on ordinal pattern statistics: the permutation entropy, permutation complexity and Fisher information, as well as their generalized versions (q-entropy and α-entropy). Further, the position of each variable in Tarnopolski diagrams is displayed and compared to reference stochastic processes, like fractional Brownian motion, fractional Gaussian noise, and \b{eta} noise. Still another way of distinguishing deterministic chaos and structured noise, and quantifying the latter, is provided by the complexity from ordinal pattern positioned slopes (COPPS). We also construct Horizontal Visibility Graphs and estimate the exponent of the decay of the degree distribution. Taken together, the analyses create a characterization of the dynamics of these systems which can be scrutinized for universality, either across variables or between the three geographically very close catchments."

A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schrödinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Liénard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches."

2503.06289,Exploring the interplay between fractionality and PT symmetry in magnetic metamaterials,['nlin.PS'],['Mario I. Molina'],"We study a nonlinear magnetic metamaterial modeled as a split-ring resonator array, where the standard discrete laplacian is replaced by its fractional form. We find a closed-form expression for the dispersion relation as a function of the fractional exponent s and the gain/loss parameter γ and examine the conditions under which stable magneto-inductive waves exist. The density of states is computed in closed form and suggests that the main effect of fractionality is the flattening of the bands, while gain/loss increase tends to reduce the bandgaps. The spatial extent of the modes for a finite array is computed by means of the participation ratio R, which is also obtained in closed form. For a fixed fractionality exponent, an increase in gain/loss γ decreases the overall R, from the number of sites N towards N/2 at large γ. The nonlinear dynamics of the average magnetic energy on an initial ring during a cycle shows a monotonic increase with γ, and it is qualitatively similar for all fractional exponents. This is explained as mainly due to the interplay of nonlinearity and PT symmetry."

The model allows us to study the transition from time-reversal symmetric to broken time-reversal symmetric dynamics. Our transformation in the kick strength parameter space $(k, k') \to (k_r, k_θ)$ reveals interesting features. The transformed kicked strength parameter $k_r$ drives a higher growth of chaos and is equivalent to the standard QKT, whereas the other transformed kicked strength parameter $k_θ$ leads to a weaker growth. We discuss the fixed points, their stability, and verify results obtained by computing the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy (KSE). We exactly solve 2- to 4-qubit versions of DKT by obtaining its eigenvalues, eigenvectors and the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we find the criteria for periodicity of the entanglement dynamics. We investigate measures of quantum correlations from two perspectives: the deep quantum and the semi-classical regime. Signatures of phase-space structure are numerically shown in the long-time averages of the quantum correlations. Our model can be realised experimentally as an extension of the standard QKT."

Key findings include the emergence of infinite towers of anomalous conservation laws within the Riccati-type approach and the identification of exact non-local conservation laws in the linear formulations of deformed models. As modified integrable models play a crucial role in diverse fields of nonlinear physics-such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superconductivity, gravity models, optics and soliton turbulence-these results may have far-reaching applications."

In the case of small perturbation a simple dynamical system is used to describe the soliton behaviour. Equilibrium points of this dynamical system are computed when the external force travels at a constant speed. Assuming that the external force moves with sinusoidal speed, we demonstrate that the soliton behavior is qualitatively similar to the constant-speed case. Besides, a resonant frequency is derived from the asymptotic theory without using the classical broad force approximation. The results obtained from the dynamical system are compared with fully direct numerical simulations, which reveal that the soliton solution exhibits spiral-like behavior in the soliton amplitude versus soliton phase space. Moreover, when the external force oscillates at the resonant frequency, the trajectories in the soliton phase versus soliton amplitude exhibit chaotic behavior."

We accomplish this by evolving randomized initial data to full patterns and evaluate feature functions, such as the number of connected components or their area distribution, on their sublevel sets. The resulting probability measure on the feature space, which we refer to as pattern statistics, can then be compared at different parameter values using the Wasserstein distance. We show that arclength predictor-corrector continuation can be used to trace out transition and bifurcation curves in parameter space by maximizing the distance of the pattern statistics. The utility of this approach is demonstrated through a range of examples involving homogeneous states, spots, stripes, and spiral waves."

In particular, for surface gravity waves, it is the backbone of wave forecasting models. Its derivation is based on the Hamiltonian dynamics of surface gravity waves. Only at the end of the derivation are the non-conservative effects, such as forcing and dissipation, included as additional terms to the collision integral. In this paper, we present a first attempt to derive the wave kinetic equation when the dissipation/forcing is included in the deterministic dynamics. If, in the dynamical equations, the dissipation/forcing is one order of magnitude smaller than the nonlinear effect, then the classical wave action balance equation is obtained and the kinetic time scale corresponds to the dissipation/forcing time scale. However, if we assume that the nonlinearity and the dissipation/forcing act on the same dynamical time scale, we find that the dissipation/forcing dominates the dynamics and the resulting collision integral appears in a modified form, at a higher order."

We evaluate three approaches: (1) doubling transmission links (bridges) between different communities, (2) adding bypasses around weakly synchronized nodes, and (3) reinforcing edges that trigger the largest cascade failures. We use two different models of the Hungarian high-voltage network. These models are built from the official data provided by the transmission system operator, thus eliminating the assumptions typically used in other studies. The coupling strength distribution of the Hungarian models shows good agreement with our previous works using the European and North American grids.
  Additionally, we examine the occurrence of Braess' paradox, where added transmission capacity unexpectedly reduces overall stability. Our results show that reinforcement through community-based bridge duplication yields the most significant improvements across all parameters. A visual comparison highlights differences between this method and traditional reinforcement approaches. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantitatively compare results of oscillator-based studies with those relying on power system analysis software.
  Characteristic results of line-cut simulations reveal cascade size distributions with fat-tailed decays for medium coupling strengths, while exponential behavior emerges for small and large couplings.

Delocalized electronic wavefunctions along π-conjugated polymer backbone can enable efficient intrachain transport, while interchain transport is generally thought slow and lossy due to weak chain-chain interactions. In contrast to the conventional strategy of mitigating structural disorder, amorphous layers of rigid conjugated polymers, exemplified by highly planar poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (IDT-BT) donor-accepter copolymer, exhibit trap-free transistor performance and charge-carrier mobilities similar to amorphous silicon. Here we report long-range exciton transport in HJ-aggregated IDTBT thin-film, in which the competing exciton transport and exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) dynamics are spectroscopically separated using a phase-cycling-based scheme and shown to depart from the classical iffusion-limited and strong-coupling regime. In the thin film, we find an annihilation-limited mechanism with a per-encounter annihilation probability of much less than 100%, facilitating the minimization of EEA-induced excitation losses. In contrast, excitons on isolated IDTBT chains diffuse over 350 nm with 0.56 cm2 s-1 diffusivity, before eventually annihilating with unit probability on first contact.

We demonstrate that for active matter in the form of self-propelled surfactants with local (nematic) aligning interactions such a Marangoni flow nontrivially influences the propagation of the density waves. Upon gradually increasing the Marangoni parameter, which characterises the relative strength of the Marangoni flow as compared to the self-propulsion speed, the density waves broaden while their speed may either increase or decrease depending on wavelength and overall mean density. A further increase of the Marangoni parameter eventually results in the disappearance of the density waves.

Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms."

In this work, we investigate the spectral decomposition of OTOCs in open quantum systems, using the dissipative modified kicked rotator (DMKR) as a paradigmatic model. By analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum Liouvillian, we identify a crucial spectral truncation criterion that enables efficient modeling of OTOC dynamics. Our results reveal two distinct temporal regimes: a long-time decay phase governed by the spectral gap and an intermediate-time regime where a small subset of subdominant eigenvalues plays a crucial role. This spectral truncation criterion allows for efficient modeling of OTOC decay and reveals a direct connection between eigenvalue structure and information scrambling. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding OTOCs in dissipative quantum systems and suggest new avenues for experimental exploration in open quantum platforms."

Our prototypical model, which arises in shallow water wave theory, is the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) equation. The higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms of the latter, lead to resonance between dispersive radiation and solitary waves, and notably, the individual waves comprising DSWs, due to non-convex dispersion. This resonance manifests as a resonant wavetrain propagating ahead of the dispersive shock wave. We present a succinct overview of the fundamental principles and characteristics of DSWs and explore analytical methods for their analysis. Wherever applicable, we demonstrate these concepts and techniques using both the classical KdV equation and its higher-order eKdV counterpart. We extend the application of the dispersive shock fitting method and the equal amplitude approximation to investigate radiating DSWs governed by the eKdV equation. We also introduce Whitham shock solutions for the regime of traveling DSWs of the eKdV model. Theoretical predictions are subsequently validated against direct numerical solutions, revealing a high degree of agreement."
2503.03014,Learning finite symmetry groups of dynamical systems via equivariance detection,"['physics.comp-ph', 'cs.LG', 'nlin.CD']","['Pablo Calvo-Barlés', 'Sergio G. Rodrigo', 'Luis Martín-Moreno']","In this work, we introduce the Equivariance Seeker Model (ESM), a data-driven method for discovering the underlying finite equivariant symmetry group of an arbitrary function. ESM achieves this by optimizing a loss function that balances equivariance preservation with the penalization of redundant solutions, ensuring the complete and accurate identification of all symmetry transformations. We apply this framework specifically to dynamical systems, identifying their symmetry groups directly from observed trajectory data. To demonstrate its versatility, we test ESM on multiple systems in two distinct scenarios: (i) when the governing equations are known theoretically and (ii) when they are unknown, and the equivariance finding relies solely on observed data. The latter case highlights ESM's fully data-driven capability, as it requires no prior knowledge of the system's equations to operate."

This paper examines their behavior for 2D and 3D lattice Ising Models, where the quasi-stability of fluctuating domains is controlled by proximity to the critical temperature. Scaling analysis lends support to an unproven conjecture that these configurational information measures (CIMs) can detect (in)stability in field theories. The primary results herein are the derivation of a model dependent CC-CE relationship, as well as a model independent upper bound on CC.

It is shown that the dynamics are richer than the corresponding results obtained just from the Korteweg-de Vries-type equation. First, a reduction to a nonlinear Schrödinger equation is obtained for weakly nonlinear wave packets, and it is demonstrated that either the focusing or the defocusing case can be obtained. This is in contrast to the corresponding reduction for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, where only the defocusing case is found. The focusing regime displays modulational instability responsible for the appearance of rogue waves. Next, the condition for modulational instability is obtained in the case of one and two monochromatic waves in interaction at slow space-time coordinates with equal scalings. Other new envelope equations are obtained starting from the general system describing shallow water waves found by Bona et al. [3]. A presumably integrable system is obtained form the integrable Kaup-Boussinesq one."

In our previous work [10], we presented a comprehensive study of this family. In this paper, we give three new results that complement the ones presented in that reference. All them refer to the most interesting and complicated case, $a<0$. For this case, the dynamics of each map is concentrated in a one-dimensional invariant graph that depend on $b$. In [10], we studied the dynamics of the family on these graphs. In particular, we described whether the topological entropy associated with the map on the graph is positive or zero in terms of the parameter $c=-b/a$. Among the results obtained, we found that there are points of discontinuity of the entropy in the transitions from positive to zero entropy. In this paper, as a first result, we present a detailed explicit analysis of the entropy behavior for the case $4<c<8$, which shows the continuity of this transition from positive to zero entropy. As a second result, we prove that for certain values of the parameter $c$, each invariant graph contains a subset of full Lebesgue measure where there are at most three distinct $ω$-limit sets, which are periodic orbits when $c \in \mathbb{Q}$. Within the framework of the third result, we provide an explicit methodology to obtain accurate rational lower and upper bounds for the values of the parameter $c$ at which the transition from zero to positive entropy occurs."

An important related concept is the one of semiflow with {\em compact dynamics}, which we defined as a semiflow $F$ with a {\em compact global trapping region}. In this follow-up, we restrict to the important case where the phase space $X$ is locally compact and we move the focus on the concept of {\em global attractor}, a maximal compact set that attracts every compact subset of $X$. A semiflow $F$ can have many global trapping regions but, if it has a global attractor, this is unique. We modify here our original definition and we say that $F$ has compact dynamics if it has a global attractor $G$. We show that most of the qualitative properties of $F$ are inherited by the restriction $F_G$ of $F$ to $G$ and that, in case of Conley's chains stream of $F$, the qualitative behavior of $F$ and $F_G$ coincide. Moreover, if $F$ is a continuous-time semiflow, then its graph is identical to the graph of its time-1 map. Our main result is that, for each semiflow $F$ with compact dynamics over a locally compact space, the graphs of the prolongational relation of $F$ and of every stream of $F$ are connected if the global attractor is connected."

Here we consider polynomial matrix functions $A(z)$. We describe these in terms of a factorization, and we then prove that if $A$ induces a Toda map, then $A$ is essentially a transfer matrix."
2503.01959,Enhanced quantum frequency estimation by nonlinear scrambling,"['quant-ph', 'nlin.CD']","['Victor Montenegro', 'Sara Dornetti', 'Alessandro Ferraro', 'Matteo G. A.

Despite breakthroughs in quantum-enhanced frequency estimation, key challenges remain: static probes limit flexibility, and the interplay between resource efficiency, sensing precision, and potential enhancements from nonlinear probes remains not fully understood. In this work, we show that dynamically encoding an unknown frequency in a nonlinear quantum electromagnetic field can significantly improve frequency estimation. To provide a fair comparison of resources, we define the energy cost as the figure of merit for our sensing strategy. We further show that specific higher-order nonlinear processes lead to nonlinear-enhanced frequency estimation. This enhancement results from quantum scrambling, where local quantum information spreads across a larger portion of the Hilbert space. We quantify this effect using the Wigner-Yanase skew information, which measures the degree of noncommutativity in the Hamiltonian structure. Our work sheds light on the connection between Wigner-Yanase skew information and quantum sensing, providing a direct method to optimize nonlinear quantum probes."

Using these structural properties, we also derive the large genus asymptotics of these two kinds of Hurwitz numbers. As a result, we prove one conjecture, and disprove another, both proposed by Do, He and Robertson."

It describes probabilistic, step-wise transitions between two modes of a subject's behavior - active and passive phases in controlling an object's dynamics - using an original stochastic differential equation. This equation governs time variations of a special variable, denoted as $ζ$, between two limit values, $ζ=0$ and $ζ=1$. The introduced trap function, $Ω(Δ)$, quantifies the subject's perception of the object's deviation from a desired state, thereby determining the relative priority of the two action modes. Notably, these transitions - referred to as the subject's action points - occur before the trap function reaches its limit values, $Ω(Δ)=0$ or $Ω(Δ)=1$. This characteristic enables the application of the proposed model to describe intermittent human control over real objects."

In this work, we fill this gap by investigating the GALI's ability to identify stable fixed points, stable limit cycles, chaotic (strange) and hyperchaotic attractors in dissipative systems generated by both continuous and discrete time dynamics, and compare its performance to the analysis achieved by the computation of the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. Through a comprehensive study of three classical dissipative models, namely the 3D Lorenz system, a modified Lorenz 4D hyperchaotic system, and the 3D generalized hyperchaotic Hénon map, we examine GALI's behavior, and possible limitations, in detecting chaotic motion, as well as the presence of different types of attractors occurring in dissipative dynamical systems. We find that the GALI successfully detects chaotic motion, as well as stable fixed points, but it faces difficulties in distinctly discriminating between stable limit cycles, chaotic attractors, and hyperchaotic motion."

From the perspective of river nonlinear dynamic system, this paper deeply understands the disorder and order in the evolution and development of river bed. Using the chaos theory, the phase diagram is legally used to identify the chaos of the river time series, and the fractal dimension is quantitatively calculated to calculate the characteristic quantities of chaos. Combined with the theory of dissipative structure, the orderliness in evolution and development is understood, and the internal mechanism of river self-organization is analyzed by the principle of minimum entropy generation. The river information entropy is introduced to identify the local scouring and silting pattern of the river section. The results show that the runoff and sediment transport in the three sections are chaotic, and the information entropy fluctuates with a certain range with time, and develops to a decreasing size, that is, the river section as a whole develops in an orderly direction. However, the chaos and disorder of the Sanmenxia section are the most prominent, which may be affected by the imbalance of sediment transport caused by the construction of the reservoir, and the change of beach trough scouring and silting here is significantly affected, and the situation has been improved with the development of bank protection projects."

2503.01196,On a hyperbolic Duffing oscillator with linear damping and periodic forcing,"['nlin.CD', 'math-ph', 'physics.comp-ph']",['Alain M. Dikandé'],"The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring with position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear damping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental in theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with parity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two metastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include nonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis circuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated conformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work we consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented by a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential has two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability parameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of the equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In the absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of anharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types. However, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical solutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described by Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into consideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases or vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply varying the deformability parameter. The Poincaré map of the proposed model carries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the standard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the bistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential."

In this paper we argue against the commonly-held belief that the symmetry group of a given equation is solely determined by its surface type as given in the famous Sakai classification. We will dispel this misconception on a specific example of a d-${\text{P}_{\mathrm{II}}}$ equation which corresponds to a half-translation on the root lattice dual to its surface-type root lattice, but which becomes a genuine translation on a sub-lattice thereof that corresponds to its real symmetry group. The latter fact is shown in two different ways: first by a brute force calculation and second through the use of normalizer theory, which we believe to be an extremely useful tool for this purpose. We finish the paper with the analysis of a sub-case of our main example which arises in the study of gap probabilities for Freud unitary ensembles, and the symmetry group of which is even further restricted due to the appearance of a nodal curve on the surface on which the equation is regularized."

We find solutions for the kinetic equation for the defocusing NLS soliton condensate, which is defined by the endpoints of the spectral support $Γ$ for the NDR. It turns out that, similarly to KdV soliton condensates (\cite{CERT}), the evolution of these endpoints is governed by the defocusing NLS-Whitham equations (\cite{Kodama}). We also study the Riemann problem for step initial data and the kurtosis of genus zero and one defNLS condensates, where we proved that the kurtosis of genus one condensate can not exceed 3/2, whereas for genus zero condensate the kurtosis is always 1."

However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviors driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding control problem as a paradigmatic example of a multi-agent control system, where agents (herders) must coordinate to confine another group of agents (targets) within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of this distributed control problem. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from average attraction to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behavior, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to crowd management systems."

We also show that a regular solution corresponding to a rarefaction wave can be described by a parabola (we call it {parabolic}-soliton). We then perform numerical simulations of the initial value problem and show that they are in excellent agreement with the results obtained by the perturbation method."

By solving the 1D extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we derive the exact analytical wavefunction and investigate the droplet dynamics under different driving conditions. Specifically, we examine three cases: (i) constant driving frequency with linearly increasing QOL depth, (ii) constant QOL depth with linearly varying driving frequency, and (iii) constant driving frequency with sinusoidally modulated QOL depth. Fast Fourier Transform analysis reveals harmonic density oscillations, confirming time crystal formation. Additionally, we establish a non-trivial correlation between time crystal frequency and system temperature, demonstrating that an increase in time crystal frequency leads to oscillatory variations in the magnitude of the droplet's negative temperature. Finally, numerical stability analysis confirms that the obtained solutions remain robust, ensuring their feasibility for experimental realization."

Examining cosmological evolution through the lens of information growth within a black hole we show the appearence of two fractal growing processes characterizing the early and late ages. These fractals induce space growth rates of $62.79\pm5.59$ km/s/Mpc and $70.07\pm0.09$ km/s/Mpc; close to the current values of the Hubble constants involved in the tension. These results strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is not given by unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors but by innate properties underlying the universe dynamics."

Our approach is first tested on the simple harmonic oscillator. We then move on to the Henon-Heiles system, i.e. a two-degree-of-freedom system of nonlinear oscillators. The integrability of the Henon-Heiles system is critically dependent on a set of three parameters within its Hamiltonian, a fact that we leverage to assess the robustness of our approach in detecting the integrability of this system with respect to the parameter dependence of the Hamiltonian. We then adapt our method to canonical examples of Hamiltonian partial differential equations, including the Korteweg-de Vries and cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equations, again testing robustness against nonintegrable perturbations of their respective Hamiltonians. In all examples, our approach reliably confirms or denies the integrability of the equations of interest. Moreover, by appropriately adjusting the loss function and applying thresholded $l^0$ regularization to enforce sparsity in the operator weights, we successfully recover accurate forms of the Lax pairs despite wide initial hypotheses on the operators. Some of the relevant Lax pairs, notably for the Henon-Heiles system and the Korteweg-deVries equation, are distinct from the ones that are typically reported in the literature. The Lax pairs that our methodology discovers warrant further mathematical and computational investigation, and we discuss extensively the opportunities for further improvement of SILO as a viable tool for interpretable exploration of integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems."
2503.00494,Analyzing the Motion of a Charged Rigid Body under the Influence of a Gyrostatic Torque,"['physics.class-ph', 'nlin.CD']",['A. H. Elneklawy'],"This research investigates the rotational dynamics of a charged axisymmetric spinning rigid body influenced by gyrostatic torque. The study also accounts for the effects of transverse and constant body-fixed torques and an electromagnetic force field. Euler's equations of motion are employed to formulate the governing equations for the system. Given the absence of torque along the spin axis and the nearly symmetric structure of the rigid body, the spin rate remains almost constant. By assuming small angular deviations of the spin axis from a fixed spatial direction, approximate analytical solutions in closed form are derived for the attitude, translational, and rotational motions. These solutions, expressed in a compact complex form, provide an effective tool for analyzing the maneuvers of rigid bodies spinning. The study derives analytical solutions for several variables, including angular velocities, Euler angles, transverse and axial displacements, and velocities. Graphical simulations of the solutions demonstrate their accuracy, while additional graphs illustrate the positive effects of varying body parameters on the motion. This work is significant in diverse scientific and engineering fields, offering insights that enhance the design of mechanical systems, explain celestial dynamics, and improve spacecraft performance."

The number of the known orbits from the class is significantly enlarged. The linear stability of the orbits is also investigated. All of them are unstable.

Lee']","Are big conflicts different from small or medium size conflicts? To answer this question, we leverage fine-grained conflict data, which we map to climate, geography, infrastructure, economics, raw demographics, and demographic composition in Africa. With an unsupervised learning model, we find three overarching conflict types representing ``major unrest,'' ``local conflict,'' and ``sporadic and spillover events.'' Major unrest predominantly propagates around densely populated areas with well-developed infrastructure and flat, riparian geography. Local conflicts are in regions of median population density, are diverse socio-economically and geographically, and are often confined within country borders. Finally, sporadic and spillover conflicts remain small, often in low population density areas, with little infrastructure and poor economic conditions. The three types stratify into a hierarchy of factors that highlights population, infrastructure, economics, and geography, respectively, as the most discriminative indicators. Specifying conflict type negatively impacts the predictability of conflict intensity such as fatalities, conflict duration, and other measures of conflict size. The competitive effect is a general consequence of weak statistical dependence. Hence, we develop an empirical and bottom-up methodology to identify conflict types, knowledge of which can hurt predictability and cautions us about the limited utility of commonly available indicators."

Central to the prescription is a presentation of random matrix theory in Mellin space, which lifts to two dimensions via the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral decomposition employed in previous work. As a demonstration we perform the explicit RMT${}_2$ lift of two-point correlations of the GUE Airy model. We propose that in AdS$_3$ pure gravity, semiclassical amplitudes for off-shell $n$-boundary torus wormholes with topology $Σ_{0,n} \times S^1$ are given by the RMT${}_2$ lift of JT gravity wormhole amplitudes. For the three-boundary case, we identify a gravity calculation which matches the RMT${}_2$ result."
2503.00095,High viscosity effects on solitary wave propagation,"['physics.flu-dyn', 'nlin.PS']","['Carlos Calvo', 'Aldo Tamburrino', 'Claudio Falcón']","We present an experimental and numerical study of linear and non-linear viscous effects in transient non-linear long wave propagation in Newtonian and shear thinning fluids in the laminar flow regime. Using optical measuring techniques (Fourier Transform Profilometry) and numerical simulations (open-source CFD library OpenFOAM), we show that the wave phase speed decreases in both glycerin and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solutions with respect to that in water. A decrease in wave phase speed is observed, and a dispersion relation is obtained for surface waves through dimensional analysis from five dimensionless groups: the dimensionless wave celerity, the shallowness parameter, dimensionless amplitude, Reynolds number and the flow index. To complete the picture on wave propagation, an empirical dependence between the wave attenuation and the last four dimensionless groups mentioned above is found for non-linear long surface waves. We conclude quantitatively about all the viscosity effects in non-linear long wave propagation."
2502.21293,On the role of 5-wave resonances in the nonlinear dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice,"['nlin.CD', 'nlin.PS']","['Tiziana Comito', 'Matteo Lotriglia', 'Miguel D. Bustamante']","We study the dynamics of the $(α+β)$ Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice (FPUT lattice, for short) for an arbitrary number $N$ of interacting particles, in regimes of small enough nonlinearity so that a Birkhoff-Gustavson type of normal form can be found using tools from wave-turbulence theory. Specifically, we obtain the so-called Zakharov equation for $4$-wave resonant interactions and its extension to $5$-wave resonant interactions by Krasitskii, but we introduce an important new feature: even the generic terms in these normal forms contain $resonant$ $interactions$ $only$, via a $unique$ canonical transformation. The resulting normal forms provide an approximation to the original FPUT lattice that possesses a significant number of exact quadratic conservation laws, beyond the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian. We call the new equations ""exact-resonance evolution equations"" and examine their properties: (i) Heisenberg representation's slow evolution allows us to implement numerical methods with large time steps to obtain relevant dynamical information, such as Lyapunov exponents. (ii) We introduce tests, such as convergence of the normal form transformation and truncation error verification, to successfully validate our exact-resonance evolution equations. (iii) The systematic construction of new quadratic invariants (via the resonant cluster matrix) allows us to use finite-time Lyapunov exponent calculations to quantify the level of nonlinearity at which the original FPUT lattice is well approximated by the exact-resonance evolution equations. We show numerical experiments in the case $N=9$, but the theory and numerical methods are valid for arbitrary values of $N$. We conclude that, when $3$ divides $N$, at small enough nonlinearity the FPUT lattice's dynamics and nontrivial hyperchaos are governed by $5$-wave resonant interactions."

However, current deep learning models often struggle with object binding, limiting their ability to represent multiple objects effectively. Inspired by neuroscience, we investigate whether synchrony-based mechanisms can enhance object encoding in artificial models trained for visual categorization. Specifically, we combine complex-valued representations with Kuramoto dynamics to promote phase alignment, facilitating the grouping of features belonging to the same object. We evaluate two architectures employing synchrony: a feedforward model and a recurrent model with feedback connections to refine phase synchronization using top-down information. Both models outperform their real-valued counterparts and complex-valued models without Kuramoto synchronization on tasks involving multi-object images, such as overlapping handwritten digits, noisy inputs, and out-of-distribution transformations. Our findings highlight the potential of synchrony-driven mechanisms to enhance deep learning models, improving their performance, robustness, and generalization in complex visual categorization tasks."

We solve for the phase diagram of a model, where a population innovates while outrunning exnovation. The dynamics progress on random graphs that capture the degree of historical contingency. Higher connectivity speeds innovation but also increases the risk of system collapse.

In particular, the odd order NLS equations permit a new class of integrable boundary conditions that involves the time reversal. We prove the integrability of the NLS hierarchy in the presence of our new boundary conditions in the sense that the models possess infinitely many integrals of the motion in involution. Moreover, we develop further the boundary dressing technique to construct soliton solutions for our new boundary value problems."

We propose a cellular automaton model for self-organizing soil structure, where soil aggregates and serves as food for microbial species. These, in turn, produce nutrients that facilitate self-amplification, establishing a cyclical dynamic of consumption and regeneration. Our model explores the spatial interactions between these components and their role in sustaining a balanced ecosystem. The main results demonstrate that (1) spatial structure supports a stable living state, preventing population collapse or uncontrolled growth; (2) the spatial model allows for the coexistence of parasitic species, which exploit parts of the system without driving it to extinction; and (3) optimal growth conditions for microbes are associated to diverse length scales in the soil structure, suggesting that heterogeneity is key to ecosystem resilience. These findings highlight the importance of spatio-temporal dynamics of life in soil ecology."

As yet a unified response-noise or response-frequency formula embracing diverse factors, such as noise color, damping coefficients, and coupling, is still lacking. In the present work, we theoretically investigate the benefit roles of Gaussian white noise and Ornstein- Uhlenbeck noise on the signal amplification of systems ranging from a single overdamped bistable particle to the mean-field coupled underdamped Duffing oscillators and severally deduce their signal response expressions. We find that the formulas of signal response in these different cases can be reduced to a uniform Lorentz function form. Furthermore, based on the general expression, we explain explicitly the role of driving frequency, coupling and the noise color on stochastic resonance. Our results contribute to a deep theoretical understanding of stochastic resonance in bistable systems."
2502.20614,Synchronization in the complexified Kuramoto model,"['math.DS', 'nlin.CD']","['Ting-Yang Hsiao', 'Yun-Feng Lo', 'Winnie Wang']","In this paper, we consider an $N$-oscillators complexified Kuramoto model. We first observe that there are solutions exhibiting finite-time blow-up behavior in all coupling regimes. When the coupling strength $λ>λ_c$, sufficient conditions for various types of synchronization are established for general $N \geq 2$. On the other hand, we analyze the case when the coupling strength is weak. For $N=2$ with coupling below $λ_c$, our complex-analytic approach not only recovers the periodic orbits reported by Thümler--Srinivas--Schröder--Timme but also provides, for the first time, their exact period $T_{ω,λ}=2π/\sqrt{ω^{2}-λ^{2}}$, confirming full phase locking. Furthermore, for the critical case $λ= λ_c$, we find that the complexified Kuramoto system admits homoclinic orbits. These phenomena significantly differentiate the complexified Kuramoto model from the real Kuramoto system, as synchronization never occurs when $λ<λ_c$ in the latter. For $N=3$, we demonstrate that if the natural frequencies are in arithmetic progression, non-trivial synchronization states can be achieved for certain initial conditions even when the coupling strength is weak. In particular, we characterize the critical coupling strength ($λ/λ_c = 0.85218915...$) such that a semistable equilibrium point in the real Kuramoto model bifurcates into a pair of stable and unstable equilibria, marking a new phenomenon in complexified Kuramoto models."

Our results show that deep learning emulators can uncover emergent behaviours and rare events in complex systems by learning underlying mathematical rules, rather than merely mimicking observed patterns."

Unlike previous studies, in which extreme events (EE) were observed solely in coupled FHN oscillators, we demonstrate that a single system can exhibit EE induced by noise. Perturbation of the deterministic model in its steady state by random fluctuations reveals the emergence of subthreshold/small-amplitude oscillations (SAO), eventually leading to rare and extreme large-amplitude oscillations (LAO), which become particularly evident at minimal noise intensities. We elucidate the route by which these EE emerge, confirming their occurrence through probability calculations of trajectories in phase space. Additionally, our investigation reveals bursting phenomena in the system, which are characterized by specific levels of noise amplitude and elucidated using inter-spike interval statistics. At higher noise amplitudes, frequent LAO production is observed and attributed to self-induced stochastic resonance. The emergence of EE is explained through the theory of large fluctuations, with the escape rates of trajectories estimated via both analytical and numerical approaches. This study is significant because it reveals EE and bursting phenomena in a single FHN oscillator, offering potential new insights into the dynamics of neuronal populations."

The paper illustrates how one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian elastic lattices with time-varying non-local feedback interactions offer unprecedented wave guidance. By relaxing the constraint of Hermiticity while preserving $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry of the nonlocal interactions, it is herein built a framework where the dispersion transitions from positive to negative group velocity, passing through an intermediate regime characterized by a perfectly flat band across all momenta. This effect, realized within the unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase, is further enhanced by the time modulation of lattice parameters, thereby unlocking functionalities such as perfect trapping, where a wave packet is intentionally stopped, and the wave boomerang effect, where the wave packet is reversed or guided back to its initial position. The framework presented in this paper unlocks opportunities that extend beyond wave guidance, including information processing through dispersion engineering in elastic media."

The algorithm, dubbed Pontryagin-Bellman Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP), is the result of the incorporation of Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) into the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) formulation. Unlike traditional indirect methods that rely on first-order shooting techniques to determine the optimal costate, PDDP optimizes the costates using a null-space trust-region method, solving a series of quadratic subproblems derived from first- and second-order sensitivities. Terminal equality constraints are handled via a general augmented Lagrangian method, while state-path constraints are enforced using a quadratic penalty approach. The resulting solution method represents a significant improvement over classical indirect methods, which are known to be ineffective for state-constrained problems. The use of DDP to optimize the costate partially reduces the inherent sensitivities of indirect methods, thereby improving the robustness to poor initial guess. Finally, the incorporation of PMP within the DDP formulation enables the design of long-duration, multi-spiral low-thrust trajectories with fewer optimization variables compared to classical DDP formulations. Although the paper emphasizes the spacecraft low-thrust trajectory optimization problem, the theoretical foundations are general and applicable to any control-affine optimal control problem."

At resonance, the QKR reduces to a finite-dimensional system. In the localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter always induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry to one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the delocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the reduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT symmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter. We further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized regime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions from Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, to Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the intermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution. For complex spectra, the level-spacing ratios and distributions are governed by time-reversal symmetry. The spectral statistics align with predictions for non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles in classes AI† and A, depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results provide insights into the spectral characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum chaotic systems and their connection to PT symmetry."

Based on the linear response theory, we theoretically derive the dependences of the ensemble signal response on the noise intensity and driving frequency of both systems. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that the noise color monotonically weakens the strength of stochastic resonance in the overdamped situation, but nonmonotonically strengthens it in the underdamped counterpart. Such a result goes against the conventional wisdom that the color of the additive noise impairs the magnitude of stochastic resonance. Finally, we perform the numerical integration to verify our theoretical results and discuss potential connections with the functional significance of 1/f noise."

The algorithm is able to detect and characterize detailed differences of information flow with corresponding distinctions in time scales for both the forward and inverse cascades, and this can be done over both fast and slower time scales.

At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian."

The existence of localized edge states in the linear limit (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger trimer, SSH3) is known to depend on the precise location of the edge. Here, we show that for a termination that does not support linear edge states, an arbitrarily weak on-site nonlinearity will induce an edge mode with asymptotic exponential localization, bifurcating from a linear band edge. Close to the gap edge, the shape of the mode can be analytically described in a continuum approximation as one half of a standard gap soliton. The linear stability properties of nonlinear edge modes are also discussed."

Previous studies have considered various non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccine efficacy, and distribution strategies. In this work, we address the combined effects of inter-group contacts and vaccination rates under contact reduction, analyzing the Spanish population's demographic and age group contact patterns and incorporating reinfection dynamics. We conduct an exhaustive analysis, evaluating 362,880 permutations of 9 age groups across 6 vaccination rates and two distinct, empirically quantified scenarios for social contacts. Our results show that at intermediate-to-high vaccination rates with unrestricted social contacts, optimal age-based vaccination strategies only slightly deviate from older-to-younger prioritization, yielding marginal reductions in deaths and infections. However, when significant reductions in social contacts are enforced -similar to the lockdowns in 2020-, there are substantial improvements, particularly at moderate vaccination rates. These restrictions lead to a transition where infection propagation is halted, a scenario that became achievable during the pandemic with the observed vaccination rates. Our findings emphasize the importance of combining appropriate social contact reductions with vaccination to optimize age-based vaccination strategies, underscoring the complex, nonlinear dynamics involved in pandemic dynamics and the necessity for tailored, context-specific interventions."

The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios."

These equations have opened up a new wave of physically important nonlinear evolution equations. Their solutions provide insights into the interplay between nonlinearity and nonlocality, making it a cornerstone in the study of nonlocal nonlinear systems. However, the stability of such solutions has not been extensively explored in the literature. Stability analysis ensures that these solutions are robust and capable of persisting under real-world perturbations, making them physically meaningful. In this work, we examine the stability of soliton solutions of four types of nonlocal nonlinear evolutionary equations: (i) the space-shifted nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger equation, (ii) the nonlocal complex time-reversed Hirota equation, (iii) the nonlocal real space-time-reversed modified Korteweg-de Vries equation, and (iv) a fourth-order nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger equation. These equations arise in various physical fields such as nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, plasmas and so on where nonlocality and nonlinearity play significant roles. We introduce certain perturbations to the soliton solutions of these equations and analyze their stability. Our findings indicate that the soliton solutions of the aforementioned equations are stable under such perturbations.

Such HOTI can support linear topological corner states that give rise to rich families of quadratic topological solitons bifurcating from linear corner states. The presence of phase mismatch between parametrically interacting fundamental-frequency (FF) and second-harmonic (SH) waves drastically affects the bifurcation scenarios and domains of soliton existence, making the families of corner solitons much richer in comparison with those in HOTIs with cubic nonlinearity. For instance, the internal soliton structure strongly depends on the location of propagation constant in forbidden gaps in spectra of both FF and SH waves. Two different types of corner solitons are obtained, where either FF or SH wave dominates in the bifurcation point from linear corner state. Because the waveguides are two-mode for SH wave, its spectrum features two groups of forbidden gaps with corner states of different symmetry appearing in each of them. Such corner states give rise to different families of corner solitons. Stability analysis shows that corner solitons in quadratic HOTI may feature wide stability domains and therefore are observable experimentally. These results illustrate how parametric nonlinear interactions enrich the behavior of topological excitations and allow to control their shapes."
2502.17819,Interactions of fractional solitons with local defects: Stabilization and scattering,"['nlin.PS', 'physics.optics']","['Thawatchai Mayteevarunyoo', 'Boris A.

Fractional solitons are unstable at LI smaller or equal to 1, or LI smaller or equal to 2 in uniform one-dimensional media with the cubic or quintic self-focusing, respectively. We demonstrate that, in these cases, the solitons may be effectively stabilized by pinning to a delta-functional trapping potential (attractive defect), which is a relevant setting in optical waveguides with the effective fractional diffraction. Using the respective fractional nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the delta-functional potential term, we find that, in the case of the cubic self-focusing, the fractional solitons are fully stabilized by the pinning to the defect for LI = 1, and partly stabilized for LI < 1. In the case of the quintic self-focusing, the full and partial stabilization are found for LI = 2 and LI < 2, respectively. In both cases, the instability boundary is exactly predicted by the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. Unstable solitons spontaneously transform into oscillating breathers. A variational approximation (VA) is elaborated parallel to the numerical analysis, with a conclusion that the VA produces accurate results for lower LI values, i.e., stronger fractionality.

2502.17690,A Fokker-Planck-Based Loss Function that Bridges Dynamics with Density Estimation,"['nlin.CD', 'cs.LG']","['Zhixin Lu', 'Łukasz Kuśmierz', 'Stefan Mihalas']","We have derived a novel loss function from the Fokker-Planck equation that links dynamical system models with their probability density functions, demonstrating its utility in model identification and density estimation. In the first application, we show that this loss function can enable the extraction of dynamical parameters from non-temporal datasets, including timestamp-free measurements from steady non-equilibrium systems such as noisy Lorenz systems and gene regulatory networks. In the second application, when coupled with a density estimator, this loss facilitates density estimation when the dynamic equations are known. For density estimation, we propose a density estimator that integrates a Gaussian Mixture Model with a normalizing flow model. It simultaneously estimates normalized density, energy, and score functions from both empirical data and dynamics. It is compatible with a variety of data-based training methodologies, including maximum likelihood and score matching. It features a latent space akin to a modern Hopfield network, where the inherent Hopfield energy effectively assigns low densities to sparsely populated data regions, addressing common challenges in neural density estimators. Additionally, this Hopfield-like energy enables direct and rapid data manipulation through the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) rule, facilitating tasks such as denoising and clustering. Our work demonstrates a principled framework for leveraging the complex interdependencies between dynamics and density estimation, as illustrated through synthetic examples that clarify the underlying theoretical intuitions."

We realize the identification of the data on the two sides, which we call the hyperbolic monopole/gCPM correspondence. For the group $\text{SU}(2)$, this correspondence had been observed by Atiyah and Murray in the 80s. Here, we revisit and generalize this correspondence and establish its origin. By invoking the work of Murray and Singer on hyperbolic monopoles, we first generalize the observation of Atiyah and Murray to the group $\text{SU}(n)$. We then propose a technology to engineer gCPM within the 4d Chern-Simons (CS) theory, which explains various features of the model, including the lack of rapidity-difference property of its R-matrix and its peculiarity of having a genus$\,\ge 2$ curve of the spectral parameter. Finally, we investigate the origin of the correspondence. We first clarify how the two sides of the correspondence can be realized from the 6d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$, the projective spinor bundle of the Minkowski space $M=\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$, for hyperbolic $\text{SU}(n)$-monopoles, and the Euclidean space $M=\mathbb{R}^4$, for the gCPM. We then establish that $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be holomorphically embedded into $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, the projective spinor bundle of $\mathbb{C}^{1,3}$, of complex dimension five with a fixed complex structure. We finally explain how the 6d CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(M)$ can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the 10d holomorphic CS theory on $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$. As the latter theory is only sensitive to the complex structure of $\mathbb{P}S(\mathbb{C}^{1,3})$, which has been fixed, we realize the correspondence as two incarnations of the same physics in ten dimensions."

Permutation entropy, Lyapunov exponents are such complexity parameters out of many. In this article, we introduce a new time series complexity parameter, that is, the permutation extropy. The failure of permutation entropy in correctly specifying complexity of some chaotic time series motivates us to come up with a better complexity parameter, hence we propose this permutation extropy measure. We try to combine the ideas behind the permutation entropy and extopy to construct this measure. We also validate our proposed measure using several chaotic maps like logistic map, Henon map and Burger map. We apply the proposed complexity parameter to study the complexity of financial time series of the stock market and time series constructed using WHO data, finding a better complexity specification than permutation entropy. The proposed measure is kind of robust, fast calculation and invariant with respect to monotonous nonlinear transformation like permutation entropy, but it gives us a better result in specifying complexity in some cases."

We propose several conjectures concerning the weak solutions of these equations, including a $b$-independent pseudo-peakon solution, a $b$-independent peakon solution, and a $b$-dependent peakon solution. These conjectures are analytically verified for $J \leq 14$ and/or $J \leq 9$ using the computer algebra software MAPLE. The $b$-independent pseudo-peakon solution is a 3rd-order pseudo-peakon for general arbitrary constants, with higher-order pseudo-peakons derived under specific parameter constraints. Additionally, we identify both $b$-independent and $b$-dependent peakon solutions, highlighting their distinct properties and the nuanced relationship between the parameters $b$ and $J$. The existence of these solutions underscores the rich dynamical structure of the $J$-bF equations and generalizes previous results for lower-order equations. Future research directions include higher-order generalizations, rigorous proofs of the conjectures, interactions between different types of peakons and pseudo-peakons, stability analysis, and potential physical applications. These advancements significantly contribute to the understanding of peakon systems and their broader implications in mathematics and physics."

The main interest for us is the use of the bi-Hamiltonian formalism for some pencils from this family, as a method for constructing involutive subalgebras for a linear bracket starting by the center of the quadratic bracket. We give some interesting examples of families of this type.
  We construct the centers of the corresponding quadratic brackets using the antidiagonal principal minors of the Lax matrix. Special attention should be paid to the condition of the log-canonicity of the brackets of these minors with all the generators of the Poisson algebra of the family under consideration. A similar property arises in the context of Poisson structures consistent with cluster transformations."

Through numerical simulations, we find that for realistic systems, the envelope function of off-diagonal elements of observables exhibits an exponential decay at large $ΔE$, while for randomized models, it tends to be flat. We demonstrate that the correlations of chaotic eigenstates, originating from the delicate structures of Hamiltonians, play a crucial role in the non-trivial structure of the envelope function. Furthermore, we analyze the numerical results from the perspective of the dynamical group elements in Hamiltonians. Our findings highlight the importance of correlations in physical chaotic systems and provide insights into the deviations from RMT predictions. These understandings offer valuable directions for future research."

We introduce a novel node-level ensemble description of lattice gas for simulating nonlinear fluid dynamics on a quantum computer. This approach combines the advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method, which offers low-dimensional representation, and lattice gas cellular automata, which provide linear collision treatment. Building on this framework, we propose a quantum lattice Boltzmann method that relies on linear operations with medium dimensionality. We validated the algorithm through comprehensive simulations of benchmark cases, including vortex-pair merging and decaying turbulence on $2048^2$ computational grid points. The results demonstrate remarkable agreement with direct numerical simulation, effectively capturing the essential nonlinear mechanisms of fluid dynamics. This work offers valuable insights into developing quantum algorithms for other nonlinear problems, and potentially advances the application of quantum computing across various transport phenomena in engineering."

We characterise the intermittent and multiscale fluctuations of this interface and also investigate how heterogeneity influences mixing via the residence times of Lagrangian tracers.

First, the adjoint Lax pair and auxiliary eigenfunctions are introduced for the direct scattering, and the analyticity, symmetries of eigenfunctions and scattering matrix are studied in detail. Then, the distribution of discrete eigenvalues is examined, and the asymptotic behaviors of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are analyzed rigorously. Compared with the Manakov system, the reverse-space nonlocality introduces an additional symmetry, leading to stricter constraints on eigenfunctions, scattering coefficients and norming constants. Further, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated for the the inverse problem with the scattering coefficients admitting an arbitrary number of simple zeros. For the reflectionless case, the N-soliton solutions are presented in the determinant form. With N=1, the dark and beating one-soliton solutions are obtained, which are respectively associated with a pair of discrete eigenvalues lying on and off the circle on the spectrum plane. Via the asymptotic analysis, the two-soliton solutions are found to admit the interactions between two dark solitons or two beating solitons, as well as the superpositions of two beating solitons or one beating soliton and one dark soliton."

The asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients is explored in detail. Furthermore, the inverse scattering problem is formulated through a suitable matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem, and the trace formula along with the reconstruction formula for the potential function are derived.

While phonon (i.e., small-amplitude vibration) wave packets have been theorized to deterministically interact with kinks and initiate their movement, this interaction has remained elusive in experiments, where only uncontrollable stochastic kink motion generated by thermal phonons or dislocation glide by low-frequency quasi-static loading have been observed. This is partly because all physical systems that support kinks are, at some level, discrete, making deterministic phonon control of kinks extremely challenging due to the existence of Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, experimental observation of phonon-mediated control and generation of mechanical kinks, which we enable using a topological metamaterial that constitutes an elastic realization of the Kane-Lubensky chain model. Our metamaterial overcomes the PN barrier by supporting a single, topologically protected kink that requires zero energy to form and move. Using simulations that show close agreement with our experimental observations, we also reveal unique dynamics of phonon interplay with highly discrete kinks, including long-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes, features absent in other discrete nonlinear systems. This work introduces a new paradigm for topological kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness tuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission."

Corresponding methods have been well-studied in one-dimensional dynamical systems. However, many practical dynamical systems require description by multi-dimensional dynamical systems, such as the mutualistic symbiotic systems formed by flowering plants and pollinating insects. Existing one-dimensional methods cannot handle the cases of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. Based on this, we propose a method to control a single node to activate network connections in multi-dimensional dynamical systems. In such systems, the changes of each node are described by multiple nonlinear differential equations. All remaining nodes are stratified according to the shortest path to the controlled node, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the system. Such a large-scale dynamical system can ultimately be replaced by a very simple system. By analyzing the reduced-dimensional system, we can predict the extent of control needed to restore the system state. We apply this method to a wide range of fields, achieving activation of various real multidimensional complex dynamical systems."

We use topological photonics to engineer a 2D lattice of hundreds of coupled silicon nitride ring resonators capable of hosting nested mode-locked states with a fast (near 1 THz) single-ring and a slow (near 3 GHz) topological super-ring timescales. We demonstrate signatures of multi-timescale mode-locking including quadratic distribution of the pump noise with the two-time azimuthal mode dimensions, as expected by mode-locking theory. Our observations are further corroborated by direct signatures of the near-transform-limit repetition beats and the formation of the temporal pattern on the slow timescale. Moreover, we show that these exotic properties of edge-confined mode-locked states are in sharp contrast to bulk and single-ring counterparts and establish a clear pathway for their identification. Our unprecedented demonstration of mode-locking in topological combs unlocks the implementation of lattice-scale synchronization and independently tunable multi-timescale mode-locking phenomena, also the exploration of the fundamental nonlinearity-topology interplay on a chip."

Through numerical simulations of an agent-based microscopic model, we found that the system exhibits distinct phenomenology compared to the original self-propelled rods. In particular, anti-parallel bands are observed in an intermediate parameter range.

The variables used to describe the membranes correspond to two distinct degrees of freedom: an internal degree of freedom for the polymer directions in addition to the positional degree of freedom. This generalised surface model enables us to identify a non-trivial interference between the TP system and the membranes. To this end, we employ a hybrid numerical technique, utilising Monte Carlo updates for membrane configurations and discrete time iterations for the FitzHugh-Nagumo type Turing equation. The simulation results clearly show that anisotropies in the mechanical deformation properties, particularly the easy axes associated with the stretching and bending of the membranes, determine the direction of the TPs to be perpendicular or parallel to the easy axes. Additionally, by calculating the dependence of the maximum entropy on the internal degree of freedom, we can obtain information on the relaxation with respect to the polymer structure. This crucial information serves to remind us that non-equilibrium configurations can be captured within the canonical Monte Carlo simulations."

Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$.

Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation."

Here we use a mechanical system -- namely coupled pendulums described by the Frenkel-Kontorova model -- to propose and observe quantized non-adiabatic Thouless pumping using topological kink solitons. The pumping proceeds by a qualitatively different mechanism compared to Thouless' original proposal as the pump is non-adiabatic and dissipation is necessary. In the presence of an additional potential gradient along the pump, we predict and observe the emergence of quantized transport against the pumping direction as a function of the period and show the emergence of a rich plateau structure; this quantization is unique to dissipative systems and cannot be described by the Chern number. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the process by pumping the soliton through a tunable nonlinear defect."

While numerous studies have focused on simulations due to the model's mathematical complexity, comprehensive theoretical analyses remain sparse. In this paper, we deliver a rigorous mathematical proof demonstrating that for any initial configuration of the Vicsek model, there exists a bound on noise amplitude such that if the noise amplitude is maintained within this bound, the system will achieve synchronization in mean. This finding not only lays a solid mathematical groundwork for the Vicsek model's phase transition theory but also underscores the critical role of noise in collective dynamics, enhancing our understanding of self-organizing systems in stochastic environments."
2502.13930,Diagnosing chaos with projected ensembles of process tensors,"['quant-ph', 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'hep-th', 'nlin.CD']","[""Peter O'Donovan"", 'Neil Dowling', 'Kavan Modi', 'Mark T. Mitchison']","The process tensor provides a general representation of a quantum system evolving under repeated interventions and is fundamental for numerical simulations of local many-body dynamics. In this work, we introduce the projected process ensemble, an ensemble of pure output states of a process tensor in a given basis of local interventions, and use it to define increasingly more fine-grained probes of quantum chaos. The first moment of this ensemble encapsulates numerous previously studied chaos quantifiers, including the Alicki-Fannes quantum dynamical entropy, butterfly flutter fidelity, and spatiotemporal entanglement. We discover characteristic entanglement structures within the ensemble's higher moments that can sharply distinguish chaotic from integrable dynamics, overcoming deficiencies of the quantum dynamical and spatiotemporal entropies. These conclusions are supported by extensive numerical simulations of many-body dynamics for a range of spin-chain models, including non-interacting, interacting-integrable, chaotic, and many-body localized regimes. Our work elucidates the fingerprints of chaos on spatiotemporal correlations in quantum stochastic processes, and provides a unified framework for analyzing the complexity of unitary and monitored many-body dynamics."
2502.13735,Kinetic modelling of economic markets with individual and collective transactions,['nlin.CG'],"['Chuandong Lin', 'Lijie Cui']","Two kinetic exchange models are proposed to explore the dynamics of closed economic markets characterized by random exchanges, saving propensities, and collective transactions. Model I simulates a system where individual transactions occur among agents with saving tendencies, along with collective transactions between groups. Model II restricts individual transactions to agents within the same group, but allows for collective transactions between groups. A three-step trading process--comprising intergroup transactions, intragroup redistribution, and individual exchanges--is developed to capture the dual-layered market dynamics. The saving propensity is incorporated using the Chakraborti-Chakrabarti model, applied to both individual and collective transactions. Results reveal that collective transactions increase wealth inequality by concentrating wealth within groups, as indicated by higher Gini coefficients and Kolkata indices. In contrast, individual transactions across groups mitigate inequality through more uniform wealth redistribution. The interplay between saving propensities and collective transactions governs deviation degree and entropy, which display inverse trends. Higher saving propensities lead to deviations from the Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium, whereas specific thresholds result in collective transaction dominance, producing notable peaks or troughs in these metrics. These findings underscore the critical influence of dual-layered market interactions on wealth distribution and economic dynamics."

Such models consider the nonlinear response of flame as an ensemble of Kuramoto phase oscillators constrained to collectively evolve at the rhythm of acoustic fluctuations. However, these high-dimensional models are analytically intractable and computationally expensive. In this study, we reduce the dimensionality of such a high-dimensional model and present a low-order, analytically tractable model for predicting transitions to thermoacoustic instability. We reduce the dimensionality of the phase oscillator model coupled to the acoustic field using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz. Using the reduced-order equations, we estimate the transitions to thermoacoustic instability and compare these transitions with the experiment. We validate the model for two combustor configurations, viz., the bluff-body stabilized dump combustor and the swirl-stabilized annular combustor. The low-order model accurately captures the continuous and abrupt secondary transitions observed experimentally in these distinct combustors."

First, we derive bright-bright, dark-dark, and bright-dark soliton solutions of the coupled Hirota equation by using the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili reduction method. Then, we present the bright and dark soliton solutions to the Sasa-Satsuma equation which are expressed by determinants of $N \times N$ instead of $2N \times 2N$ in the literature. The dynamics of first-, second-order solutions are investigated in detail. It is intriguing that, for the SS equation, the bright soliton for \(N=1\) is also the soliton to the complex mKdV equation while the amplitude and velocity of dark soliton for \(N=1\) are determined by the background plane wave. For \(N=2\), the bright soliton can be classified into three types: oscillating, single-hump, and two-hump ones while the dark soliton can be classified into five types: dark (single-hole), anti-dark, Mexican hat, anti-Mexican hat and double-hole. Moreover, the types of bright solitons for the Sasa-Satsuma equation can be changed due to collision."

Specifically, we present an empirical description of the distance distribution, focusing on characteristic changes of its shape with increasing embedding dimension. Our results suggest that selecting the recurrence threshold according to a fixed percentile of this distribution reduces the dependence of recurrence characteristics on the embedding dimension in comparison with other commonly used threshold selection methods.

Poincaré sections show regular Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori when black hole and cosmological horizons are distant, but distortions and chaos emerge as they converge. As the horizons coincide, the Poincaré sections fully contract and vanish, marking the system's transition to Nariai spacetime. \textit{Our analysis also suggests that, within the parameter range explored, the event horizon exerts a comparatively more substantial chaotic influence on the system, primarily due to its consistent proximity.} Additionally, we analyze the Lyapunov exponents to quantify the degree of chaos in the system. Our findings indicate that as the closeness of the two horizons increases, the most prominent Lyapunov exponent also increases, signifying a rise in chaotic behavior. By examining the long-term saturation values of the Lyapunov exponents, we confirm that they consistently comply with the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) bound."

Under moderate Reynolds number, the flow field undergoes processes of vortex emergence, entrainment, rolling and pairing, merging, and dissipation. Due to the small Stokes number of nanoparticles, and the particles moves closely following the flow field. Meanwhile, the particle undergoes coagulation under the influence of Brownian motion. This article discusses the evolution nanoparticle under the combined effect of advection, diffusion and coagulation. Under the influence of vortices or large-scale coherent structures, the spatial distribution of particle moments is similar to the structure of the flow field. And diffusion and coagulation have a significant impact on the amplitude of the distribution of particle moments. However, diffusion has little impact on the mean distribution, while coagulation has a much greater impact on the mean distribution. As the flow field evolves, the temporal mixing layer degenerates into Couette flow. The particles exhibit similar asymptotic behavior as that of 0-dimensional problem."

We establish that these RW patterns are intrinsically related to the root structures of a novel class of polynomials, termed generalized mixed Adler--Moser (GMAM) polynomials, which feature multiple arbitrary free parameters. The RW patterns can be understood as straightforward expansions and slight shifts of the root structures for the GMAM polynomials to some extent. In the $(x,t)$-plane, they asymptotically converge to a first-order RW at the position corresponding to each simple root of the polynomials and to a lower-order RW at the position associated with each multiple root. Notably, the position of the lower-order RW within these patterns can be flexibly adjusted to any desired location in the $(x,t)$-plane by tuning the free parameters of the corresponding GMAM polynomials."

Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos, which is interpreted as a ``mixing"" time. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. Further, a hierarchy of $t_{\text{Lyapunov}} < t_{\text{chaos}} < t_{\text{thermalization}}$ is found in these models. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems."

We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli."

In this paper we propose a minimal model for defect self-propulsion in a nematic active solid: a linear elastic medium with an embedded nematic texture that generates active stress and associated elastic strains. We show that such coupling gives rise to self-propelled +1/2 defects that move relative to the elastic medium by local remodeling of the nematic texture without advection. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the fluid case and can lead to unbinding of defect pairs and stabilization of +1 defects. Our findings might help explain how orientational order, of, for example, muscle fibers, is reconfigured during morphogenesis in solid-like tissues. The proposed mechanism may, for instance, control motility and merging of +1/2 defects, which play a crucial role in setting up the body axis during Hydra regeneration."

Inspired by the critical brain hypothesis, which proposes that the brain operates optimally near a critical point of phase transition in the dynamics of neural networks to improve computational efficiency, we postulate that spontaneous activity plays a homeostatic role in the development and maintenance of criticality. Criticality in the brain is associated with the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (EI balance), which is essential for maintaining neural computation performance. Here, we hypothesize that both criticality and EI balance are stabilized by appropriate noise levels and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) windows. Using spiking neural network (SNN) simulations and in vitro experiments with dissociated neuronal cultures, we demonstrated that while repetitive stimuli transiently disrupt both criticality and EI balance, spontaneous activity can develop and maintain these properties and prolong the fading memory of past stimuli. Our findings suggest that the brain may achieve self-optimization and memory consolidation as emergent functions of noise-driven spontaneous activity. This noise-harnessing mechanism provides insights for designing energy-efficient neural networks, and may explain the critical function of sleep in maintaining homeostasis and consolidating memory."

Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study theoretically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their analysis. Here, we characterize glassy dynamics using the dynamic mode decomposition, a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum. We show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation, and thus, we propose a model-agnostic signature for robustly detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of a one-dimensional ODE and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators."

In this paper, we numerically analyze a ring network of phase oscillators, in which synchronous states with different wavenumbers are simultaneously stable. This model is an extension of the one studied in detail in previous studies by introducing inhomogeneities in the natural frequencies and the phase delay in the interaction, which are essential factors in the application. We investigate basin size distribution, which characterizes the size of the initial value set that converges to each synchronous state, showing that the basin size of synchronous states with higher wave-numbers broadens as the phase delay increases up to a certain extent. Weak inhomogeneities in the natural frequencies are also found to broaden the basin size of synchronous states with lower wave-numbers, i.e., more synchronous states. The latter result is seemingly counter-intuitive, but occurs because the higher wavenumber states are more vulnerable to inhomogeneity. Finally, we propose a control method that exploits inhomogeneity and phase delay to steer the system into a synchronized state with a specific wavenumber. This research furthers our understanding of the design principles and control of oscillator networks."

Reddit's r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created compositions, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 minutes at a false positive rate of just 3.7%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity.

The transient dynamics of a turbulent supersonic twin-rectangular jet flow, forced symmetrically at a Strouhal number of 0.9, are studied using synchronized large-eddy simulations (LES) and space-time proper orthogonal decomposition (space-time POD). Under plasma-actuated control, the statistically stationary jet evolves towards a cyclostationary state over a transient phase. Forcing-induced perturbations of the natural jet are extracted using synchronized simulations of the natural and forced jets. A database is collected that captures an ensemble of realizations of the perturbations within the initial transient. The spatiotemporal dynamics and statistics of the transient are analyzed using space-time POD for each symmetry component. The eigenvalue spectra unveil low-rank dynamics in the symmetric component. The spatial and temporal structures of the leading modes indicate that the initial pulse of the actuators produces large, impulsive perturbations to the flow field. The symmetric mode reveals the contraction of the shock cells due to the forcing, and shows the evolution of the mean flow deformation transient."

Making an analogy to bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data. By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a ""map"" of dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior.

Recent combined study of experiments and mathematical modeling by the group led by the third author suggests that a species of garden ant switches the individual foraging walk from pheromone-mediated to visual-cues-mediated depending on situation. If an initial pheromone-road between the nest and food sources is a detour, ants using visual cues can pioneer shorter paths. These shorter paths are reinforced by pheromone secreted by following ants, and then the detour ceases to exist. Once the old pheromone-road extincts, there will be almost no chance to reconstruct it. Hence the extinction of pheromone-road is expected to be regarded as a phase transition to an absorbing state. We propose a discrete-time model on a square lattice consisting of switching random walks interacting though time-dependent pheromone field. The numerical study shows that the critical phenomena of the present extinction transitions of pheromone-roads do not seem to belong to the directed percolation universality class associated with the usual absorbing-state transition. The new aspects are cased by the coexistence and competition with newly creating pheromone-roads. In a regime in the extinction phase, the annihilating road shows metastability and takes long time-period to be replaced by a new road."

In this theory, the evolution of a ``maximally mixed'' classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states."

However, the majority of social interactions occur within groups of individuals, characterized by higher-order structures. The mechanisms driving group formation and the impact of higher-order interactions, which arise from group dynamics, on information spreading in face-to-face interaction networks remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we examine some representative human face-to-face interaction data and find the recurrent patterns of groups. Moreover, we extend the force-directed motion (FDM) model with the forces derived from similarity distances within a hidden space to reproduce the recurrent group patterns and many key properties of face-to-face interaction networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the FDM model effectively predicts information-spreading behaviors under higher-order interactions. Finally, our results reveal that the recurrence of triangular groups inhibits the spread of information in face-to-face interaction networks, and the higher-order interactions will make this phenomenon more pronounced. These findings represent a significant advancement in the understanding of group formation and may open new avenues for research into the effects of group interactions on information propagation processes."

When complex pairs of eigenvalues turn unstable, precursors of plateaus grow, separated by defects where the GL amplitude vanishes. Nonlinear effects either saturate the amplitude of plateaus or lead to a phase-locked state, with saddle-node bifurcations separating the two regimes.

In the linear regime, vortex states are characterized by quantum numbers, $n$ and $m$, corresponding to the transverse and circumferential directions, with the phase structure determined by the winding number (WN) $m$. Odd and even values of $n$ must associate, respectively, with integer and half-integer values of $m$, the latter ones requiring two cycles of motion around MS for returning to the initial phase. Using variational and numerical methods, we solve the GP equation with the attractive nonlinearity, producing a family of ground-state (GS) solitons for values of the norm below the critical one, above which the collapse sets in. Vortex solitons with $n=1,m=1$ and $% n=2,m=1/2$ are obtained in a numerical form. The vortex solitons with $% n=1,m=1$ are almost uniformly distributed in the azimuthal direction, while ones with $n=2,m=1/2$ form localized states. The Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion and linear-stability analysis for the GS soliton solutions and vortices with $n=1,m=1$ demonstrates that they are completely stable, while the localized states with $n=2,m=1/2$ are completely unstable. Finally, the motion of solitons on the MS and the collision of two solitons are discussed."

Bradley', 'Nils A. Krause']","We present a quantitative analytical framework for calculating two-point velocity correlations in compressible quantum fluids, focusing on two key classes of superfluid excitations: vortices and rarefaction pulses. We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids."

This transmission phenomenon may occur in systems that exhibit different effective elasticity in compression and tension; i.e. bilinear elasticity. We present a computational investigation of unilateral transmission in the steady-state response of harmonically driven mechanical systems with bilinear coupling. Starting with two bilinearly coupled oscillators, we find that breaking the mirror symmetry of the system, in either elastic or inertial properties, facilitates unilateral transmission by allowing it to occur near a primary resonance. This asymmetry also enables nonreciprocal transmission to occur. We then investigate the nonreciprocal dynamics of the system, including linear stability analysis, with a focus on unilateral transmission. We also extend our discussion to a bilinear periodic structure, for which we investigate the influence of the number of units and energy dissipation on unilateral transmission. We report on the existence of stable nonreciprocal unilateral transmission near primary and internal resonances of the system, as well as other nonreciprocal features such as period-doubled and quasiperiodic response characteristics."

Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models."

Roque']","The Fitzhugh-Nagumo neuronal model is used to explore the influence of the electric field on thermosensitive neurons' dynamics. This study investigates how the electric field affects polarization modulation in cell media induced by changes in ion charge density by adding electrical field as a new variable. Driven by a voltage source acting as an external stimulus current, different firing mode responses of the proposed model are analyzed when an external electrical field is applied. Through computational analysis, the study evaluates the impact of parameters such as cell radius, stimulus voltage source amplitude, frequency, and as well as the presence of an external electric field. The results demonstrate distinct mode transitions of isolated neurons ranging from spiking to bursting, regular and chaotic oscillations. These findings suggest that the firing mode is triggered by periodic external electric fields and cell radius, with the electric field's involvement enhanced to regulate neuron activity and control the dynamics. External electric fields and stimuli play a crucial role in neuronal firing dynamics, affecting the transition between different firing modes. Understanding these effects contributes to the comprehension of neural processes and the potential manipulation of neural activity for various applications in neuroscience and biophysics."

Here we focus on how such states can be destabilized from a fundamental perspective; namely, we address the question of how one or a few intruder agents within an otherwise functioning network may compromise its dynamics. We show that a single adversarial node coupled via adversarial couplings to one or more other nodes is sufficient to destabilize the entire network, which we prove to be more efficient than targeting multiple nodes. Then, we show that concentrating the attack on a single low-indegree node induces the greatest instability, challenging the common assumption that hubs are the most critical nodes. This leads to a new characterization of the vulnerability of a node, which contrasts with previous work, and identifies low-indegree nodes (as opposed to the hubs) as the most vulnerable components of a network. Our results are derived for linear systems but hold true for nonlinear networks, including those described by the Kuramoto model. Finally, we derive scaling laws showing that larger networks are less susceptible, on average, to single-node attacks. Overall, these findings highlight an intrinsic vulnerability of technological systems such as autonomous networks, sensor networks, power grids, and the internet of things, with implications also to the realm of complex social and biological networks."

In particular, self-propelled particle systems provide challenging research subjects in experimental and theoretical physics, since individual and collective behaviors of units performing persistent motions can not be described by usual fluctuation theory for equilibrium systems. A typical example of man-made self-propelled systems which can be easily handled in small-sized experiments is a system of camphor floats put on the surface of water. Based on the experimental and theoretical studied by Nishimori et al. (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 86 (2017) 101012), we propose a new type of mathematical models for complex motions of camphor disks on the surface of water. In the previous mathematical models introduced by Nishimori et al. are coupled systems of the equations of motion for camphor disks described by ordinary differential equations and the partial differential equation for the concentration field of camphor molecules in water. Here we consider coupled systems of equation of motions of camphor disks and random walks representing individual camphor molecules in water. In other words, we take into account non-equilibrium fluctuations by introducing stochastic processes into the deterministic models. Numerical simulation shows that our models can represent self-propelled motions of individual camphor disk as well as repulsive interactions among them. We focus on the one-dimensional models in which viscosity is dominant, and derive a dynamical system of a camphor disk by taking the average of random variables of our stochastic system. By studying both of stochastic models and dynamical systems, we clarify the transitions between three phases of motions for a camphor disk depending on parameters."

We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number."

Such a phenomenon has been found assuming a Gaussian noise source, delta-correlated both in time and space. In light of the potential implications of this generation technique, e.g., for the experimental observation of breathers in long Josephson junctions, it is physically motivated to investigate the effects of more realistic noise sources with finite correlation time and/or correlation length. Here, breathers are demonstrated to still emerge under this broader class of noise sources. The correlation time and the correlation length are found to offer control over the probability of observing breathers, as well on the typical timescale for their emergence. In particular, our results show that, as compared to the thermal case, the temporal and spatial correlations in the noise can lead to a larger breather-only occurrence frequency, i.e., the latter quantity behaves nonmonotonically versus both the correlation time and the correlation length. Overall, noise correlations represent a powerful tool for controlling the excitation of the elusive breather modes in view of experiments."

Amigó', 'Roberto Dale', 'Juan C. King', 'Klaus Lehnertz']","Given two unidirectionally coupled nonlinear systems, we speak of generalized synchronization when the responder \textquotedblleft follows\textquotedblright\ the driver. Mathematically, this situation is implemented by a map from the driver state space to the responder state space termed the synchronization map. In nonlinear times series analysis, the framework of the present work, the existence of the synchronization map amounts to the invertibility of the so-called cross map, which is a continuous map that exists in the reconstructed state spaces for typical time-delay embeddings. The cross map plays a central role in some techniques to detect functional dependencies between time series. In this paper, we study the changes in the \textquotedblleft noiseless scenario\textquotedblright\ just described when noise is present in the driver, a more realistic situation that we call the \textquotedblleft noisy scenario\textquotedblright . Noise will be modeled using a family of driving dynamics indexed by a finite number of parameters, which is sufficiently general for practical purposes. In this approach, it turns out that the cross and synchronization maps can be extended to the noisy scenario as families of maps that depend on the noise parameters, and only for \textquotedblleft generic\textquotedblright\ driver states in the case of the cross map. To reveal generalized synchronization in both the noiseless and noisy scenarios, we check the existence of synchronization maps of higher periods (introduced in this paper) using recurrent neural networks and predictability.

However, the identification of CE and the maximization of EI both rely on coarse-graining strategies, which is a key challenge. A recently proposed CE framework based on approximate dynamical reversibility utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD) is independent of coarse-graining but is limited to transition probability matrices (TPM) in discrete states. To address this problem, this article proposes a pioneering CE quantification framework for Gaussian iterative systems (GIS), based on approximate dynamical reversibility derived from the SVD of covariance matrices in forward and backward dynamics. The positive correlation between SVD-based and EI-based CE, along with the equivalence condition, are given analytically. After that, we can provide precise coarse-graining strategies directly from singular value spectrums and orthogonal matrices. This new framework can be applied to any dynamical system with continuous states and Gaussian noise, such as auto-regressive growth models, Markov Gaussian systems, and even SIR modeling by neural networks (NN). Numerical simulations on typical cases validate our theory and offer a new approach to studying the CE phenomenon, emphasizing noise and covariance over dynamical functions in both known models and machine learning."

In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieve enhanced practical applicability, response theory should be interpretable, capable of focusing on relevant timescales, and amenable to data-driven and equation-agnostic implementations. Along these lines, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we present linear and nonlinear response formulas for Markov chains. We obtain simple and easily implementable expressions that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as of higher-order correlations. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if the underlying evolution equations are unknown. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allows to elucidate the role of different time scales and modes of variability, and to find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals."

Mailybaev']","Chaotic systems are characterised by exponential separation between close-by trajectories, which in particular leads to deterministic unpredictability over an infinite time-window. It is now believed, that such butterfly effect is not fully relevant to account for the type of randomness observed in turbulence. For example, tracers in homogeneous isotropic flows are observed to separate algebraically, following a universal cubic growth, independent from the initial separation. This regime, known as Richardon's regime, suggests that at the level of trajectories, and unlike in chaos theory, randomness may in fact emerge in finite-time. This phenomenon called 'spontaneous stochasticity' originates from the singular nature of the underlying dynamics, and provides a candidate framework for turbulent randomness and transport. While spontaneous stochasticity has been mathematically formalised in simplified turbulence models, a precise and systematic tool for quantifying the various facets of this phenomenon is to this day missing. In particular, it is still unclear whether chaos is important for that behaviour to appear.
  In this paper we introduce a 3d rough flow that can be tuned to present Lagrangian chaos. The flow is inspired by the Weierstrass function and is entitled 'the WABC model'. After analysing its properties, we define what is spontaneous stochasticity in this context. The provided formal definition is then adapted to better suit for numerical analysis. We present the results from Monte-Carlo simulations of Lagrangian particles in this flow. Within the numerical precision, we quantitatively observe the appearance of spontaneous stochasticity in this model. We investigate the influence of noise type and find that the observed spontaneous stochasticity does not depend on the chosen stochastic regularisations."

Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly relied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching a specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed flexibility of human behaviors, where individuals adapt their strategies dynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we introduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning. In this form, players not only reciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative environments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To explore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their interactions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic mixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically adopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation when the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the cooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the probability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of cooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the ""psychological shifts"" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics. Model extensions confirm the robustness of our findings. These results highlight the novel complexities arising from the diversity of conditional cooperators."

The DSs and vortices are produced by numerical solution of the corresponding one- and two-dimensional fractional nonlinear Schrödinger equations. We show that solution branches of fundamental and higher-order DSs collide pair-wise (merge) and disappear with the increase of the gain-loss strength, revealing nonlinear PT phase transitions in the waveguide. Numerically identifying the merger points, we demonstrate effects of the fractional diffraction on the phase transition.The phase transition points determine boundaries of existence regions for the DSs and vortices.The stability of the DSs and vortices is studied by means of the linearization with respect to small perturbations. Direct simulations of perturbed evolution corroborate their stability properties predicted by the analysis of small perturbations."

Here, motivated by swarming bacteria Myxococcus xanthus, we investigate the combined effects of the individual pattern of migration and of particle-particle interactions, on the emergence of collective migration. We analyze the effects of a feature of individual pattern migration, the persistence of motion, on the collective properties of the system that emerge from interactions among individuals; in particular, when nematic velocity alignment interaction mediates collective dynamics. We find, through computer simulations and mathematical analysis, that an initially disordered migratory state can become globally ordered by increasing either, the particle-particle alignment interaction strength or the persistence of individual migration. In contrast, we find that persistence prevents the emergence of global nematic order when both persistence and nematic alignment are comparatively high. We conclude that behavior at the population level does not only depend on interactions between individuals but also on the individuals' own intrinsic behavior."

This study applies complex network analysis to explore the structural evolution of UFC matchmaking and its impact on competitive dynamics, fighter prominence, and audience engagement. By constructing directed and undirected networks where fighters represent nodes and bouts define edges, we examine key metrics such as degree distribution, clustering, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. Our findings reveal how the UFC's matchmaking strategies transitioned from tightly clustered, repetitive matchups in its early years to a more decentralized and strategically curated fight network. We identify distinct structural properties between winners and losers, showing that successful fighters maintain centrality while frequently losing fighters exhibit surprising degrees of sustained connectivity. Correlations with Pay-Per-View sales and Google search trends suggest that network dispersion and novelty in matchups drive greater audience interest, while excessive clustering and density reduce engagement. Furthermore, comparisons with official rankings (Pound-for-Pound, champions, and top-15 fighters) demonstrate that traditional success metrics only partially align with network-based prominence, highlighting the complex interplay between structural connectivity, commercial appeal, and competitive success. This research contributes to the understanding of sports as complex adaptive systems and provides insights into how strategic matchmaking shapes both competitive integrity and economic viability in professional mixed martial arts."

We analyze the periodic interactions of two vortex pairs with the same absolute strength moving along the same axis and in the same direction. We derive an explicit formula for the leapfrogging period, considering different initial sizes and horizontal separations, and find excellent quantitative agreement with the numerically computed leapfrogging period. We then extend our study to three coaxial vortex pairs with differing strengths, exploring a broad range of initial geometric configurations, and identify conditions that lead to escape to infinity, periodic or quasi-periodic leapfrogging, and chaotic interactions. We also quantify the occurrence of periodic leapfrogging, revealing that the system transitions to two subsystems when vortex pairs have dissimilar strengths and sizes. By performing a sensitivity analysis using neural networks, we find that the initial horizontal separation between the vortex pairs has the most significant effect on the leapfrogging period."

This principle has been challenged by the findings of a previous work [arXiv:1701.07596], where it was argued that a quantum system driven in time by a certain aperiodic sequence without any explicit symmetries, dubbed the Thue-Morse drive, gives rise to emergent nonergodic steady states which are underpinned by effective conserved quantities. Here, we resolve this apparent tension. We rigorously prove that the Thue-Morse drive achieves a very strong notion of quantum ergodicity in the long-time limit: The time evolution of any initial state uniformly visits every corner of its Hilbert space. On the other hand, we find the dynamics also approximates a Floquet drive for arbitrarily long albeit finite periods of time with no characteristic timescale, resulting in a scale-free ergodic dynamics we call critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity. Furthermore, numerical studies reveal that critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity is not specific to the Thue-Morse drive and is, in fact, exhibited by many other aperiodic drives derived from morphic sequences, i.e., words derived from repeatedly applying substitution rules on basic characters. Our work presents a new class of dynamics in time-dependent quantum systems where full ergodicity is eventually attained, but only after astronomically long times."
2502.06908,Volterra map and related recurrences,"['nlin.SI', 'math-ph']",['Andrei K. Svinin'],"In this paper we analyze recent work \cite{Hone1} by Hone, Roberts and Vanhaecke, where the so-called Volterra map was introduced via the Lax equation that looks similar to the Lax representation for the Mumford's system \cite{Vanhaecke}. This map turns out to be birational and a corresponding dynamical system on an affine space $M_g$ of dimension $3g+1$ was associated with it. This mapping is related to some discrete equation of the order $2g+1$ associated with the Stieltjes continued fraction expansion of a certain function on a hyperelliptic (elliptic) curve of genus $g\geq 1$. The authors of the paper provides examples of this equation for the simplest cases $g=1$ and $g=2$, but for higher values of $g$, corresponding equation turns out to be too cumbersome to write them out.
  We present an approach in which the mentioned $(2g+1)$-order equation can be written out for all values of $g\geq 1$ in a compact form. This equation is not new and can be found, for example, in \cite{Svinin3}. An essential point in our framework is the use of special class of discrete polynomials which as shown to be closely related to the Stieltjes continued fraction. On the one hand, this allows us to generalize some of the results of the work \cite{Hone1}. On the other hand, many things in this approach can be presented in a more compact and unified form. Ultimately, we believe that this allows us to give a new perspective on this topic."
2502.06723,Spatial Pattern Formation in Eco-Evolutionary Games with Environment-Driven Motion,"['q-bio.PE', 'nlin.PS', 'physics.soc-ph']","['Tianyong Yao', 'Daniel B. Cooney']","The sustainable management of common resources often leads to a social dilemma known as the tragedy of the commons: individuals benefit from rapid extraction of resources, while communities as a whole benefit from more sustainable extraction strategies. Such a social dilemma can be further complicated by the role played by space for both resources and harvesters, where spatial diffusion of resources and directed motion of harvesters can potentially feature the emergence of clusters of environmental resource and sustainable harvesting strategies. In this paper, we explore a PDE model of evolutionary game theory with environmental feedback, describing how the spatial distribution of resource extraction strategies and environmental resources can change due to both local eco-evolutionary dynamics and environmental-driven directed motion of harvesters. Through linear stability analysis, we show that this biased motion towards higher-quality environments can lead to spatial patterns in the distribution of extraction strategies, creating local regions with improved environmental quality and increase payoff for resource extractors. However, by measuring the average payoff and environmental quality across the spatial domain, we see that this pattern-forming mechanism can actually decrease the overall success of the population relative to the equilibrium outcome in the absence of spatial motion. This suggests that environmental-driven motion can produce a spatial social dilemma, in which biased motion towards more beneficial regions can produce emergent patterns featuring a worse overall environment for the population."

Beyond the interplay among the network coupling, the amplitude of the external periodic signal, and the intensity of stochastic fluctuations, the maintenance of stochastic resonance also crucially depends on the resonance capacity of each oscillator composing the network. This scenario raises the question: Can local defects in the ability of oscillators to resonate break down the stochastic resonance phenomenon in the entire network? Here, we investigate this possibility in complex networks of prototypical bistable oscillators in a double-well potential. We test the sustainability of stochastic resonance by considering a fraction of network oscillators with nonresonant potential landscapes. We find that the number of nonresonant oscillators depends nonlinearly on their dissimilarity from the rest of the network oscillators. In addition, we unravel the role of the network topology and coupling strength in maintaining, or suppressing, the stochastic resonance for different noise levels and number of nonresonant oscillators. Finally, we obtain a low-dimensional deterministic model confirming the results observed for the networks."
2502.06131,Nonlinearity-induced Fractional Thouless Pumping of Solitons,"['nlin.PS', 'cond-mat.mes-hall', 'physics.optics']","['Yu-Liang Tao', 'Yongping Zhang', 'Yong Xu']","Recent studies have shown that a soliton can be {\it fractionally} transported by slowly varying a system parameter over one period in a nonlinear system. This phenomenon is attributed to the nontrivial topology of the corresponding energy bands of a linear Hamiltonian. Here we find the occurrence of fractional Thouless pumping of solitons in a nonlinear off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper model. Surprisingly, this happens despite the fact that all the energy bands of the linear Hamiltonian are topologically trivial, indicating that nonlinearity can induce fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Specifically, our results show that a soliton can be pumped across one unit cell over one, two, three or four pump periods, implying an average displacement of $1$, $1/2$, $1/3$ or $1/4$ unit cells per cycle, respectively. We attribute these behaviors to changes in on-site potentials induced by a soliton solution, leading to the nontrivial topology for the modified linear Hamiltonian. Given that our model relies solely on varying nearest-neighbor hoppings, it is readily implementable on existing state-of-the-art photonic platforms."
2502.05962,Slow Patterns in Multilayer Dislocation Evolution with Dynamic Boundary Conditions,"['math.AP', 'nlin.PS']","['Yuan Gao', 'Stefania Patrizi']","In this paper, we study the slow patterns of multilayer dislocation dynamics modeled by a multiscale parabolic equation in the half-plane coupled with a dynamic boundary condition on the interface. We focus on the influence of bulk dynamics with various relaxation time scales, on the slow motion pattern on the interface governed by an ODE system. Starting from a superposition of N stationary transition layers, at a specific time scale for the interface dynamics, we prove that the dynamic solution approaches the superposition of N explicit transition profiles whose centers solve the ODE system with a repulsive force. Notably, this ODE system is identical to the one obtained in the slow motion patterns of the one-dimensional fractional Allen-Cahn equation, where the elastic bulk is assumed to be static. Due to the fully coupled bulk and interface dynamics, new corrector functions with delicate estimates are constructed to stabilize the bulk dynamics and characterize the limiting behavior of the dynamic solution throughout the entire half-plane."
2502.05204,Invariant Measures for Data-Driven Dynamical System Identification: Analysis and Application,"['math.DS', 'cs.LG', 'nlin.CD', 'physics.data-an']",['Jonah Botvinick-Greenhouse'],"We propose a novel approach for performing dynamical system identification, based upon the comparison of simulated and observed physical invariant measures. While standard methods adopt a Lagrangian perspective by directly treating time-trajectories as inference data, we take on an Eulerian perspective and instead seek models fitting the observed global time-invariant statistics. With this change in perspective, we gain robustness against pervasive challenges in system identification including noise, chaos, and slow sampling. In the first half of this paper, we pose the system identification task as a partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problem, in which synthetic stationary solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, obtained as fixed points of a finite-volume discretization, are compared to physical invariant measures extracted from observed trajectory data. In the latter half of the paper, we improve upon this approach in two crucial directions. First, we develop a Galerkin-inspired modification to the finite-volume surrogate model, based on data-adaptive unstructured meshes and Monte-Carlo integration, enabling the approach to efficiently scale to high-dimensional problems. Second, we leverage Takens' seminal time-delay embedding theory to introduce a critical data-dependent coordinate transformation which can guarantee unique system identifiability from the invariant measure alone. This contribution resolves a major challenge of system identification through invariant measures, as systems exhibiting distinct transient behaviors may still share the same time-invariant statistics in their state-coordinates. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical tests which highlight the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of challenging system identification tasks."

The model reveals the existence of two chaotic attractors within these subspaces. We identify parameter values at which these attractors either exhibits a locally riddled basin of attraction or transitions into a chaotic saddle. In particular, we demonstrate that, for an open region in the parameter plane, their basins are intermingled. It is shown that a fractal boundary curve separates the basins of attraction of these two chaotic attractors, providing a detailed characterization of the riddled basin structure. Additionally, we show that the model undergoes a blowout bifurcation. An estimation of the stability index is examined using thermodynamic formalism. We also perform a multifractal analysis of the level sets of the stability index."

In networks of coupled oscillators patterns can arise when the system synchronizes to an external input. Hence, these networks provide processing and memory of input. We present a universal framework for harnessing oscillator networks as computational resource. This computing framework is introduced by the ubiquitous model for phase-locking, the Kuramoto model. We force the Kuramoto model by a nonlinear target-system, then after substituting the target-system with a trained feedback-loop it emulates the target-system. Our results are two-fold. Firstly, the trained network inherits performance properties of the Kuramoto model, where all-to-all coupling is performed in linear time with respect to the number of nodes and parameters for synchronization are abundant. The latter implies that the network is generically successful since the system learns via sychronization. Secondly, the learning capabilities of the oscillator network, which describe a type of collective intelligence, can be explained using Kuramoto model's order parameter. In summary, this work provides the foundation for utilizing nature's oscillator networks as a new class of information processing systems."

Previously, an analysis of homoclinic solutions around a non-vanishing background (associated with a saddle equilibrium) led to a Korteweg-de Vries reduction. Here, we consider a different equilibrium of the co-traveling frame model, namely a center, and expanding around it, by means of a multiple-scale methodology and suitable scalings, leads to an effective defocusing nonlinear Schr{ö}dinger equation. Leveraging the latter, we construct, for the first time to our knowledge, physically realistic dark soliton waveforms of the Adlam-Allen model.

The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems."
2502.04152,Leading and beyond leading-order spectral form factor in chaotic quantum many-body systems across all Dyson symmetry classes,"['cond-mat.stat-mech', 'math-ph', 'nlin.CD', 'quant-ph']","['Vijay Kumar', 'Tomaž Prosen', 'Dibyendu Roy']","We show the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) spectral correlations in the chaotic phase of generic periodically kicked interacting quantum many-body systems by analytically calculating spectral form factor (SFF), $K(t)$, up to two leading orders in time, $t$. We explicitly consider the presence or absence of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry to investigate all three Dyson's symmetry classes. Our derivation only assumes random phase approximation to enable ensemble average. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=1$, we show that beyond the Thouless time $t^*$, the SFF takes the form $K(t)\simeq 2t-2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to second order in time, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the Hilbert space dimension. This is identical to the result from circular orthogonal ensemble of RMT. In the absence of $\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, we show that $K(t)\simeq t$ beyond $t^*$, and there is no universal term in the second order, unlike the $\mathcal{T}^2=1$ case, in agreement with the result of circular unitary ensemble. For $\mathcal{T}$-invariant systems with $\mathcal{T}^2=-1$, we show that $K(t)\simeq 2t+2t^2/\mathcal{N}$ up to two orders in time beyond $t^*$, in agreement with the result of circular symplectic ensemble. In all three cases, the system-size, $L$, scaling of $t^*$ is determined by eigenvalues of a doubly stochastic matrix $\mathcal{M}$. For strongly interacting fermionic chains, $\mathcal{M}$ is $SU(2)$ invariant in all three cases, leading to $t^*\propto L^2$ in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry. In the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, we find $t^*\propto L^0$, due to gapped non-degenerate second-largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal{M}$ or $t^*\propto \ln(L)$ due to gapped second-largest eigenvalue with degeneracy $\propto L^ζ$. Our calculation of SFF is plausible in higher space dimensions as well, where similar system-size scalings of $t^*$ can be obtained."

In particular, we use the Lagrangian descriptors method to study the phase space structure of the unforced and undamped Duffing oscillator when its time evolution is governed by fractional-order differential equations. In our study, we implement two types of fractional derivatives, namely the standard Grünwald-Letnikov method, which is a finite difference approximation of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, and a Grünwald-Letnikov method with a correction term that approximates the Caputo fractional derivative. While there is no issue with forward-time integrations needed for the evaluation of Lagrangian descriptors, we discuss in detail ways to perform the non-trivial task of backward-time integrations and implement two methods for this purpose: a `nonlocal implicit inverse' technique and a `time-reverse inverse' approach. We analyze the differences in the Lagrangian descriptors results due to the two backward-time integration approaches, discuss the physical significance of these differences, and eventually argue that the nonlocal implicit inverse implementation of the Grünwald-Letnikov fractional derivative manages to reveal the phase space structure of fractional-order dynamical systems correctly."

In this article, we studied a simple and quasi-aparametric Axelrod model of culture dynamics assuming structured (hierarchically organized) initial conditions. As a first remarkable point, the maximum final culture branching is observed to correspond to a highest uncontrollability regime of an entropy based framework described before. Also, this model shows a quantization of culture patterns that can be explained with the aid of that formalism."

The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex.

We demonstrate a passive mode-locking phenomenon induced by the coherent interaction of the Kerr effect and Brillouin scattering, which generates a frequency comb with a repetition rate exceeding the free spectral range of the cavity. This parametric process modulates the continuous wave (CW) pump and can then be transformed into a train of almost square-wave pulses thanks to the generation of switching waves.

Using an extended self-consistency approach, we show that such spatially locked chimera states can be reproduced as steady solutions of the system in the continuum limit. Furthermore, we develop a variational argument to explain the mechanism leading to spatial locking. Our analysis reveals how heterogeneity can affect the collective dynamics of the chimera states and offers insights into their control and applications."

Using a combination of replicator equations, finite-size scaling analysis, and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the long-term evolutionary dynamics of this game. Our central finding is a counterintuitive threshold phenomenon: the role (sender or receiver) with the larger difference in payoffs between successful and unsuccessful interactions is surprisingly more likely to lose in the long run. We show that this effect is robust across different parameter values and arises from the interplay between the relative speeds of evolution of the two roles and the ability of the slower evolving role to exploit the fixed strategy of the faster evolving role. Moreover, for finite populations we find that the initially less frequent strategy of the slower role is more likely to fixate in the population. The initially rarer strategy in the less-rewarded role is, paradoxically, more likely to prevail."

This two-dimensional quantum model, besides the conservation of the angular momentum, exhibits higher-order integrals of motion within the enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg algebra $\mathfrak h_2$. By constructing suitable combinations of these integrals, we uncover a polynomial Higgs-type symmetry algebra that, through an appropriate change of basis, gives rise to a deformed oscillator algebra. The associated structure function $Φ$ is shown to factorize into two commuting components $Φ=Φ_1 Φ_2$. This framework enables an algebraic determination of the possible energy spectra of the model for the cases $N=2,3,4$, the case $N=1$ being canonically equivalent to the harmonic oscillator. Based on these findings, we propose two conjectures which generalize the results for all $N\ge 2$ and any value of the coefficients $γ_k$, that they are explicitly proven for $N=5$. In addition, all of these results can be interpreted as superintegrable perturbations of the original quantum Zernike system corresponding to $N=2$ which are also analyzed and applied to the isotropic oscillator on the sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces."

In this paper, direct numerical simulations of the intermittent reversals of the LSC in a two-dimensional square domain are performed, and the time series of the total angular momentum indicating the rotational direction of the LSC is predicted by reservoir computing whose input consists of the shear rates and temperatures at six locations on the sidewalls. The total angular momentum in the simulation after times shorter than half the typical duration of the quasi-stable states is successfully reproduced by the locally-measurable quantities on the sidewalls because the secondary rolls accompanied by the boundary flow characterize the reversal of the LSC. The successful prediction by such sparse input derived from local measurements on the sidewalls demonstrates that the reservoir computing prediction of the reversal is feasible in laboratory experiments and industrial applications. On the other hand, long-term prediction often provides the total angular momentum opposite in sign to the one in the simulations in the late parts of long quasi-stable states. The statistical independence of each reversal implies that the prediction after the reversal is difficult or even impossible, and the training data in the late part in the long quasi-stable state, which rarely appears, is contaminated by the statistically-independent angular momentum in the subsequent quasi-stable state."

Charó', 'Denisse Sciamarella', 'Juan Ruiz', 'Stefano Pierini', 'Michael Ghil']","Templexes are topological objects that encode the branching organization of a flow in phase space. We build on these objects to introduce the concept of topological modes of variability (TMVs). TMVs are defined as dynamical manifestations of algebraically defined cycles, called generatexes, in the templex; they provide a concrete link between abstract topological invariants and time-dependent behavior in a model or in observations. We apply this approach to a low-order model of the wind-driven ocean circulation, subject to both periodic and aperiodic forcing, and show how TMVs emerge or vanish over time in nonautonomous settings. The analysis reveals that TMVs allow for a qualitatively new understanding of variability in complex systems where linear modes fail to describe the nonlinear dynamics."
2502.01750,Integrable deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity,"['hep-th', 'gr-qc', 'nlin.SI']","['Mattia Cesàro', 'David Osten']","Dimensional reduction of gravity theories to $D=2$ along commuting Killing isometries is well-known to be classically integrable. The resulting system typically features a coset $σ$-model coupled to a dilaton and a scale factor of the dimensional reduction. In this article, we construct two families of deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity that preserve the Lax integrable structure.
  The first family is an extension of the Auxiliary Field Deformation recently introduced by Ferko and Smith, while the second family consists in the embedding of the Yang-Baxter $σ$-model into $D=2$ dimensionally reduced gravity. For both deformations we construct flat Lax representations. The Auxiliary Field Deformation, in particular, preserves the rich algebraic structure underlying the undeformed model and, leaving the canonical structure of the Lax connection's spatial components essentially unchanged, allows us to prove its integrability also in the Hamiltonian sense."
2502.01693,Predicting Steady-State Behavior in Complex Networks with Graph Neural Networks,"['cs.LG', 'cs.AI', 'nlin.AO']","['Priodyuti Pradhan', 'Amit Reza']","In complex systems, information propagation can be defined as diffused or delocalized, weakly localized, and strongly localized. This study investigates the application of graph neural network models to learn the behavior of a linear dynamical system on networks. A graph convolution and attention-based neural network framework has been developed to identify the steady-state behavior of the linear dynamical system. We reveal that our trained model distinguishes the different states with high accuracy. Furthermore, we have evaluated model performance with real-world data. In addition, to understand the explainability of our model, we provide an analytical derivation for the forward and backward propagation of our framework."
2502.01499,Refined Painlevé/gauge theory correspondence and quantum tau functions,"['hep-th', 'math-ph', 'nlin.SI']","['G. Bonelli', 'A. Shchechkin', 'A. Tanzini']","In this paper we study strong coupling asymptotic expansions of ${\mathcal N}=2$ $D=4$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory partition functions in general $Ω$-background. This is done by refining Painlevé/gauge theory correspondence in terms of quantum Painlevé equations, obtained from $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_2$ blowup relations. We present a general ansatz and a systematic analysis of the expansions of the gauge theory partition functions by solving the above equations around the strong coupling singularities, including Argyres-Douglas points. We compare our results with refined holomorphic anomaly equations and irregular Virasoro conformal blocks."
2502.01219,Control Strategy for Generalized Synchrony in Coupled Dynamical Systems,['nlin.CD'],"['Vishal Juneja', 'Suresh Kumarasamy', 'Aryan Patel', 'Amrita Punnavajhala', 'Ram Ramaswamy']","Dynamical systems can be coupled in a manner that is designed to drive the resulting dynamics onto a specified lower dimensional submanifold in the phase space of the combined system. On the submanifold, the variables of the two systems have a well-defined unique functional relationship. This process can thus be viewed as a control technique that ensures generalized synchronization. Depending on the nature of the dynamical systems and the specified submanifold, different coupling functions can be derived in order to achieve a desired control objective. We discuss the circuit implementations of this strategy in representative examples of coupled chaotic dynamical systems, namely Lorenz oscillators"
2502.01054,Nonreciprocal amplification toward chaos in a chain of Duffing oscillators,"['nlin.CD', 'doi', '10.1103/gl1t-t2c4']","['Luekai Zhao', 'Bojun Li', 'Nariya Uchida']","A chain of harmonic oscillators with nonreciprocal coupling exhibits characteristic amplification behavior that serves as a classical analog of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). We extend this concept of nonreciprocal amplification to nonlinear dynamics by employing double-well Duffing oscillators arranged in ring-structured units. The addition of units induces bifurcations of attractors, driving transitions from limit cycles to tori, chaos, and hyper-chaos. Unidirectional couplings between units enable the decomposition of attractors in phase space into projected subspaces corresponding to each unit. In the chaotic regime, amplitude saturation emerges, characterized by monotonically decreasing amplitudes within a unit -- in sharp contrast to} the increasing profiles seen in the linear NHSE. This work uncovers novel bifurcation behavior resulting from the intricate interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity."
2502.00933,L{é}vy-noise-induced wavefront propagation for bistable systems,['nlin.AO'],['Vladimir V. Semenov'],"The influence of the L{é}vy noise's properties on wavefront propagation is analyzed on examples of ensembles of locally coupled bistable oscillators and a single bistable delayed-feedback oscillator considered as a spatially-extended system evolving in quasi-space. It is shown that additive L{é}vy noise allows to induce wavefront propagation in ensembles of symmetric bistable oscillators. In such a case, the direction and velocity of the noise-sustained propagation is determined both by the noise's skewness parameter and by the coupling topology (bidirectional and unidirectional coupling schemes are distinguished). In addition, additive L{é}vy noise induces wavefront propagation in a bistable delayed-feedback oscillator assumed to be symmetric such that its dynamics replicates the collective behaviour in the ensemble with unidirectional coupling. The wavefront propagation velocity used in this analysis is shown to be varied when adjusting the noise parameters. The revealed effects are demonstrated in the ensembles by using numerical simulation, whereas the numerical exploration of the delayed-feedback oscillator is complemented by physical experiments, showing a good correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena."
2502.00884,Synchronization of the time-delayed Kuramoto model in a regular network,['nlin.AO'],"['Sara Ameli', 'Esmaeil Mahdavi', 'Mina Zarei', 'Farhad Shahbazi']","This study investigates the impact of delayed coupling on the global and local synchronization of identical coupled oscillators residing in a ring. Utilizing the Kuramoto model, we examine the effects of delayed coupling on collective dynamics. Our analytical and numerical results reveal distinct synchronization behaviors across various time delay regimes, including fully synchronized states, helical patterns, dynamically incoherent states, and random phase-locked states. We identify the regime in which time delay inhibits synchrony, which aligns with theoretical predictions derived from stability analysis. In the region between the synchrony-possible and synchrony-forbidden zones, a coexistence of synchronized and unsynchronized dynamics is observed, referred to as Chimera states. We ascertain that the type of Chimera states present is moving-turbulent."
2502.00659,"Energy, enstrophy and helicity transfers in polymeric turbulence","['physics.flu-dyn', 'nlin.CD']","['Alessandro Chiarini', 'Rahul K. Singh', 'Marco E. Rosti']","We characterise the scale-by-scale transfers of energy, enstrophy and helicity in homogeneous and isotropic polymeric turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The microscale Reynolds number is set to $Re_λ\approx 460$, and the Deborah number $De = τ_p/τ_f$ is varied between $1/9 \le De \le 9$; $τ_p$ is the polymeric relaxation time and $τ_f$ is the turnover time of the largest scales of the flow. The study relies on the exact scale-by-scale budget equations (derived from the the governing model equations) for energy, enstrophy and helicity, which account for the back-reaction of the polymers on the flow. Polymers act as a sink/source in the flow, and provide alternative routes for the scale-by-scale transfers of the three quantities, whose relevance changes with $De$. We find that polymers deplete the nonlinear energy cascade mainly at smaller scales, by weakening both the extreme forward as well as reverse local events. The new polymer-driven energy flux dominates at small scales for $De \ge 1$, and on average transfers energy from larger to smaller scales with localised backscatter events. Polymers weaken the stretching of vorticity with the enstrophy being mainly generated by the fluid-polymer interaction, especially when $De \ge 1$. Accordingly, an inspection of the small-scale flow topology shows that polymers favour events with two-dimensional state of straining, and promote/inhibit extreme extension/rotation events: in polymeric turbulence shear and planar extensional flows are more probable. The helicity injected at the largest scales shows a similar transfer process to as energy, being mainly driven by the nonlinear cascade at large scales and by the polymer-driven flux at small scales. Polymers are found to favour events that break the small-scale mirror symmetry, with the relative helicity monotonically increasing with $De$ at all scales."
2502.00252,Multiple Temporal Compression as a method to control the generation of bright and dark solitons,"['physics.optics', 'nlin.PS']","['André C. A. Siqueira', 'Palacios G.', 'Mario B. Monteiro', 'Albert S. Reyna', 'Boris A. Malomed', 'Edilson L. Falcão-Filho', 'Cid B. de Araújo']","Recently published works have shown that the Multiple Temporal Compression (MTC) method is a more efficient approach for generation of multiple bright solitons in stacked waveguides, in comparison to the traditional soliton-fission technique. In the present paper, we performed systematic computer simulations of the appropriate generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation to extend the MTC method for generation of dark solitons through controlled interactions of bright solitons in waveguiding systems with the normal group-velocity dispersion. Further, the generated dark solitons are demonstrated to be useful for accurately governing the dynamics of bright solitons generation in complex systems based on stacked waveguides. Therefore, we report scenarios that provide mitigation or switching of the energy transfer during bright-soliton collisions, along with the ability of the cascaded MTC processes to increase the number of the generated solitons. These results underscore the potential of the MTC as a versatile method for managing the propagation dynamics of multiple temporal bright and dark solitons produced by a single input pulse, with possible applications for the design of optical devices."
